Kaladin Shash 00:00:00 I forgot Craig.
Dungeon Master 00:00:01 Damn, dude. Nobody talks with as much confidence as Craig does.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:01 Yeah, that guy, he's got it. I'll have to pull this sidebar and just summarize it week after week. Got a character description for Craig.
Zariel Torgan 00:00:07 Oh, shit. Yeah. Craig, quit stealing my girl.
Dungeon Master 00:00:30 That way it doesn't mess everything up. How you been doing, Jesse? I did know that.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:31 Yeah. Whoa. Do you have property in St. Helens that you keep your horses at then? Oh, okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:00:38 Oh, not bad. Just got back from camping, which was cool. What else? I bought some horses. What else? No, there's a farm up here on the mountain that I keep them at. Yeah, I don't own all that.
Kaladin Shash 00:00:47 More?
Leopold Magnus 00:01:00 Cool, oh, yeah, I guess now that you say that, you drive through a whole bunch of pastoral areas. Right, yeah, you just label them. Yeah, no, that's crazy. My grandfather has mules, so I would always ride on this. That's a lot of fun.
Dungeon Master 00:01:06 Mm-hmm. Yeah, you do Well, it's enough, you know Me wolf it's dick
Zariel Torgan 00:01:10 yeah so anyway but yeah it'll be cool because uh i haven't had horses since i was a kid and well those weren't mine but anyway it'll be it'll be fun oh yeah plus it beats um speaking of mules
Kaladin Shash 00:01:24 Sweet. Yeah, they're even even more rugged. Believe it.
Leopold Magnus 00:01:33 Yeah. Oh, no way. Uh huh. Yeah, that's, uh, they would take them into, uh, the Eagle Cap wilderness and pack them in for elk camp. They have like 500 pounds of gear, six miles into the wilderness. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:01:37 Yeah, we have a one-eyed jack mule that we bring camping every year. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:01:54 Really, no issue. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:01:56 Yeah. With like three or four stocks. I think they like the big ones carry almost 50 pounds of side. So a hundred pounds of gear. Yeah. No, no shit. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:02:05 Yeah, that sounds exactly like what we do without the elk hunting part. We go up to the Blue Mountains and we pack horses with canvas packs. And then we walk in, yeah, like probably four to six miles down into the National Forest there, Umatilla National Forest, and we camp there for like a week or two. No, no, I really don't camp. I just do that one thing every year.
Dungeon Master 00:02:11 So honest.
Leopold Magnus 00:02:27 Okay, that's fucking awesome. Have you ever been into the minor? Oh, okay. Yeah. That's great. That's, uh, yeah, that's, that's super fun. It's just great to be out. And I've always marveled the fact that you can pack those animals so much weight and just be like sitting in luxury in the middle of the woods.
Kaladin Shash 00:02:36 I love that answer, I guess.
Zariel Torgan 00:02:50 It's amazing. All right. Well, I think I'm good.
Leopold Magnus 00:03:01 Should we get to it? Oh, hell yeah, dude. You had a little side quest that killed some fuckers and came back all badass.
Dungeon Master 00:03:05 Nice. Very funny. OK, yeah. We did it for a little bit. We were just chatting.
Kaladin Shash 00:03:06 Yeah, so you guys missed it last week. We went ahead and a little bit. I'm at like level 5 right now.
Zariel Torgan 00:03:22 Oh, that's great. I also love the idea of a DM with one character, one player character in the DM, just two dudes hanging out.
Kaladin Shash 00:03:36 We were just chatting for a while, and we realized, we're like, oh, where is it? It's been a few minutes. Where is everybody at? Snow. Oh, man.
Dungeon Master 00:03:36 character talk, things like that? No. No, for sure you didn't. You can check your phone. Okay, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:03:42 Yeah, I felt terrible when I was like, oh shit, did I get mixed up? Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:03:51 Yeah, I was out fishing. I came back, I checked my phone, and I'm like, I thought we talked about this. I was like, oh. Oh, that's funny. Oh, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:04:05 Okay, you hooligans. Let's get to it. Bit of a recap. First and foremost, this is session six. You know, I'm already up there. Big numbers here. Last session was a lot of sort of general maintenance stuff. You guys took care of tasks, completed odd jobs, had some important discussions. Not too much has been done, so it's like the specifics we can go over, but it was really just like
Kaladin Shash 00:04:16 Wake up.
Dungeon Master 00:04:35 bridging and doing small things getting towards this festival that had been set up to sort of send off a group of Omen Knights on the first expedition out of the dome in at least a couple months. And you had been pretty instrumental in gathering pieces for the Arcane Splitter, which was the device that Hamhawk and Leopold had sort of built together in order to have this be possible.
Dungeon Master 00:05:02 During the festival, your guys' job was mostly to maintain posts. You are pretty new, so you're not seen as, like, high enough priority to have anywhere close to it. A little sad, but it's true. Obviously, something had to go wrong, so during this festival, once the Overnights had gotten out, a large lycanthropic wolf assailed the squad.
Dungeon Master 00:05:27 through good rolls from you guys there weren't a whole lot you guys ended up killing it with that uh reinforcements had been sent in and then eventually a black guard had been uh dispatched by the lord marshal and it went through but you haven't there's been the gate's been sort of just closed since so there is no update that you're aware of when we left off also during this sort of like panic and craze
Dungeon Master 00:05:53 a cult that had been just sort of whispers up until now called the Hand of God made themselves known with like an attack on the general populace. You were able to sort of have a hand in this and through, you know, sort of long drug out fight, you guys finally managed to dispatch or, well, it's not everybody. One of them got away, but you got just about everybody down, did your job. And then we ended the whole thing with
Dungeon Master 00:06:20 Uh, you guys have just taken a short and rest and you would ask, uh, ratchet where like to go next for this. And he had informed you that like your next mission is to figure out what the fuck this is. And, but the only thing that he could think of was for you to go to, uh, like a bar, a tavern called, um, who?
Zariel Torgan 00:06:44 Is that him or me? Oh, you were cutting out in and out. I didn't know if it was me or... Okay, it was me then. I just wanted to double check. I'll move my setup. I heard most of it. I heard like 90%, but you cut out a little bit.
Dungeon Master 00:06:51 Am I cutting out? I said it earlier. Oh. Perfect. You're basically told that you should go check out the Spit and Swallow, just sort of a ruffian bar in the market district near like the loading zone in the industrial area where just like mostly the workers are.
Kaladin Shash 00:06:53 No, no, you are coming in fine for me, John.
Leopold Magnus 00:06:55 Yeah, I was hearing.
Dungeon Master 00:07:18 And so that's the last thing we sort of ended with. You guys haven't technically gotten there. So if you had something, you're like, oh, I actually wanted to do this first. We could always cover that. Otherwise, I think the intention is to head to the bar.
Leopold Magnus 00:07:36 Bye.
Kaladin Shash 00:07:37 Yeah, I think does anyone need to? Is there any order of business after that encounter? Are we going? We we got to rest. We got the orders. Are we leaving right after the orders? What time of day is it? What time of day is it? OK. OK.
Dungeon Master 00:07:49 A short rest. At this point, it's like closer to evening. You don't know that you have to do anything right now. That's just sort of how it ended, was you guys had taken a short rest. And the last thing that was discussed was that bar. I don't know if you guys wanted to do something else, but I don't know.
Kaladin Shash 00:08:13 Um? Jonathan, just remind me timeline wise. Do we check on the female before we went on to do crowd control? Oh yeah, there it is. So yeah, perfect. Yeah, so we just did that recently. Yep, I got got nothing to do. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:08:20 Yeah, you had specifically gone. Yeah. Do you stable make changes to her estate? Yeah. That was like the morning of. That's what I'm saying. Last lesson, we kind of just sort of took out everything you need to do. So I think it was just all business.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:41 Yeah, I think we're ready to rock.
Leopold Magnus 00:08:43 Let's do it.
Kaladin Shash 00:08:48 Yeah, yeah. Does anyone. Have particularly good with Jesse should or.
Dungeon Master 00:08:53 OK, who wants to give me? Because this is a pretty big city. You guys haven't been there before. We'll just do survival checks to find it will do three of them. So all one of you can do all of them or you can split it up evenly.
Zariel Torgan 00:09:16 Yeah, I got a plus five on survival. Zem, do you want to aid me? Or is that something we can do on this one? Alright, so I'll go with advantage. Is that okay, Jonathan? Alright. First one, out of the gate. Eighteen.
Kaladin Shash 00:09:19 I'm going to let you roll for me. Yeah. Sorry, not bad.
Dungeon Master 00:09:32 Yeah, that's fine. Cheating, but it's cool. It is pretty good. You feel like you're on the right track. You're making your way through the city. Unlike the western side of the market district sort of sorting through.
Dungeon Master 00:09:57 And you ask a person where to go, and they give you rough instructions, and you're sort of following it. And then just go ahead and give me one more. Since 18 was a pass, we'll just see if you can get two out of three. Yeah, you do.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:07 All right. I know the Western side real well. 22.
Dungeon Master 00:10:15 Easy enough. It is pretty late at night at this point. It's evening. It's not so late that people are going to bed, but it's definitely the social hours of the night. So you hear a lot of music coming from down the street.
Dungeon Master 00:10:31 as you think you're on the right path and then you hear it and it's, you're like, oh yeah, absolutely, we're on the right track. You approach this place and at this part of the storm district, I mean, sorry, the market district, it's also sort of like cobbled stone, it's not as nicely paved, it's very run down, it's not really a rich portion, it's like a looking man, blue collar area. This building in particular is like real old school as far as the city goes, it's like,
Dungeon Master 00:11:00 wooden tavern, hanging sign. There's like a banister of like a guardrail around the front porch of the bar and you've got some people like out there smoking and drinking and chatting. But like it's got the hinged doors that you push in as you walk in and you walk in. This is what you guys roughly see.
Kaladin Shash 00:11:23 from the tavern doors. He just said he was country, right?
Zariel Torgan 00:11:23 My kind of place. Swinging doors. Yeah, now I'm cowboy country. Well, I don't know about that, but this is a nice place.
Dungeon Master 00:11:29 Your character gets a different kind of country every time we do this. To that point, this place is dirty and grimy and gritty. There's
Leopold Magnus 00:11:32 Ozariel, is a frog hopped down your throat? You're sounding quite hoarse today.
Dungeon Master 00:11:59 chips and like gashes in the wooden walls all around. You see posters torn up and hanging different areas. It's a huge ruckus. Everybody's chatting and having fun. There's like a bard in the corner playing his fiddle really well, and he's sort of getting the crowd to come along with it. People are singing, and in the center, the most notable feature is you see everybody surrounded around this large sand fighting pit that's sort of built into the ground.
Dungeon Master 00:12:28 And there just seems to be like two commoners equivalent people fighting. They've got their sleeves rolled up and just bare knuckle boxing as people cheer on and place bets. And there's whistling and hollering and people.
Dungeon Master 00:12:40 throning in disdain as their person loses. You see somebody seems to be organizing the bets at the far end. There's a bartender over in the corner. But not represented in this is it's totally packed with people. So not that it's going to happen, but if it were to be a combat, it would be like difficult terrain kind of thick movement. That's how many people are here.
Kaladin Shash 00:13:05 Okay. We're looking for clues.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:07 Nice. Can I get a quick reminder of what we're doing here again? I think I might have not been here yet. Oh. OK, gotcha.
Dungeon Master 00:13:14 You don't know. You are looking for any sort of connection to the hand of God. You're looking for informants. You're just you. Ratched said that this is like his go to place for the underground activity as well. Like this is just the place he knew. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:13:34 Jonathan. And I make an investigation around the bar, I'm looking for maybe like a small carving into a wooden post or underneath the table, like some kind of signage, you know, like that might subtly draw interest if you knew the ins and outs of the cult. Yeah, exactly. Just something on you. I wouldn't recognize it, of course. Or maybe do I recognize the sigil from
Kaladin Shash 00:13:36 Question? No.
Dungeon Master 00:13:50 What to look for, yeah. They didn't have, they just had really basic like potato bag robes, you know, like no discerning features. It wasn't obvious. There's no iconography or symbols of whatever they represent.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:03 what the cultists were wearing. They were wearing signage, right? Okay. Can you? Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:14:21 they just said like their name as the guy died so that's the only reason you have as much as you do because I believe it was Zariel who killed somebody as they were going to say something I don't totally remember who had done it somebody killed the planned informant and it was really funny so this is like
Leopold Magnus 00:14:36 That's right, yeah, he just butchered that guy, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:14:45 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 00:14:45 This was your next location, essentially. But yeah, I'm going to say, here's what I'll say. Since you don't know what you're looking for necessarily, you can do a standard DC that I already had in mind with disadvantage, or you can do a straight roll with a higher DC, but it'll be investigation either way.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:07 Okay. Um, yeah, I, how about this? Could I ask, uh, kind of whisper in the groups here? Like, Hey, if you spot anything pointed out and maybe they can give me some advantage or just a flat role. Yes. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:15:20 So normal roll with, normal DC with a straight roll. Sweet, yeah, go for it. DC was 18, nice. You don't, you are making your way down to the bar.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:37 18.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:39 Nice.
Kaladin Shash 00:15:41 Not bad, not bad.
Dungeon Master 00:15:48 Um, on your way to the bar, you don't actually see anything there that you're looking for. You just happen to look over, uh, at like the fighting arena. There's a loud cheer, everything. And then you notice there's a guy leaning up against like the wall, sitting in like a tall stool seems to be observing the fight.
Dungeon Master 00:16:09 um large muscular man but he's got like the old um you know bronxton sort of uh think classic english fighter uh like pugilist body build you know like he's very muscular but you don't see definition in the muscle he's just like balloon muscle big kind of deal um sitting
Kaladin Shash 00:16:24 Sweet.
Leopold Magnus 00:16:34 Like fake muscle? Got it, okay.
Dungeon Master 00:16:38 No, just like large, but he's not lean and like shredded. It's just huge muscles. And then he's watching the fight and what you notice on him is hanging at his side, not accurate to this photo because this one's a little too intense. He's got like a
Zariel Torgan 00:16:58 you.
Dungeon Master 00:17:00 like waist rosary bead type deal going on and at the edge of that is a little symbol of a right hand facing outward all the fingers are extended outward but slightly curled forward like as if you were palming trying to palm a frisbee like just ever so slightly at the edge the fingers curl forward and it's totally iron it's unrefined so it's that sort of like dull gray color um
Dungeon Master 00:17:27 hanging at his side. And that's what you pick up as you're walking to the bar. You realize like, this is like a pretty relatively new group, not going to really find what you're looking for. And then you look and you're like, oh shit, that's it.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:45 Yeah, I'll kind of move through the crowd here, probably knocking people out of the way on accident. And communicate that when I was looking around, I observed quite the man and point off to this guy and say, why, fellas, I think we might have to ask that gentleman some questions.
Kaladin Shash 00:18:14 Would we be able to see, from him pointing out, would we be able to see the pendant at his side? Why him? Okay. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:18:21 So not from over here, you guys are pretty far away and there's a ton of people in here. This area, even with as tall as you are, there's too many people to make him out from here. You saw him from like a clear shot when you walk into the bar, but like from this angle, you can't see him.
Leopold Magnus 00:18:28 Well, did you take a look at him? First of all. Got it. Yeah, I'm just kind of like standing above the crowd because I imagine I'm fairly tall pointing.
Kaladin Shash 00:18:45 Okay. Okay. What do you pull? Stop. Stop pointing. Put your arms down. Keep them at just...
Zariel Torgan 00:18:45 Hmm. Well. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:18:53 in his general direction and kind of going on and on about why I think he looks quite suspicious in a very, just like, rambling but honest manner. Leopold swings just the torso moving and kind of points his finger at Kaladin, rests it on his nose.
Kaladin Shash 00:19:15 Keep them at your side. Yes, but you must be more subtle. That's fantastic.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:19 What are you going on about? I'm ascertaining the direction that we must flow. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. I suppose. Oh, this is with disadvantage, too. Hold on.
Dungeon Master 00:19:31 uh leopold go ahead and give me a uh a stealth check um just to see how in general you are fitting in 18 is good but you guys catch that he's not super subtle like you guys are in your like
Zariel Torgan 00:19:38 Yeah, that giant metal man.
Kaladin Shash 00:19:46 Oh no. No.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:49 It was a disadvantage because I'm wearing a big suit of armor.
Dungeon Master 00:20:01 recognizable uniform so like anybody who sees you know is you're part of the Legionnaire but Leopold especially is so enormously tall and is just a suit of armor that is like mechanized inside and he's waving his hands all over like at least half of the tavern has probably noticed him at one point or the other so any chance at um stealthiness and sort of
Dungeon Master 00:20:29 snooping and scoping out has likely been torched at this point.
Kaladin Shash 00:20:30 Go go go. Excellent. Yes, yes. OK.
Leopold Magnus 00:20:43 Well, I do say we should talk to him.
Zariel Torgan 00:20:43 I feel like Leo's gonna end up getting left in the car a lot. Well, you boys think we should pretend to be something other than what we are, or should we play this straight? I'm not the best at lying.
Kaladin Shash 00:21:09 I think we've already been seen, and we have our uniform on. You can stand close, I will go talk to him. This is getting out of hand.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:27 All right, I'll meet you around the backside. That way he doesn't slip out. And then I'd like to go around the opposite side of the fighting pit and just pace Kaladin to meet this guy here. That way he can't just kind of slip through the crowd. I'll go here.
Dungeon Master 00:21:43 So you guys are going in either side of the fighting pit.
Leopold Magnus 00:21:46 Yeah, I'm going to move over on the side of the fighting pit. Just kind of drawn to the attraction, maybe start kind of watching the fight. I'm not really paying close attention to what's going on with that guy.
Dungeon Master 00:22:08 It's very funny that you guys went on alternate sides. As you're sort of approaching and you're like sidestepping in between people and sort of, just sort of weaving your way through, bobbing through the crowds, you get to a point where people, these two individuals on each side actually step in front of you. And the one at Caledon goes,
Zariel Torgan 00:22:08 would we say?
Kaladin Shash 00:22:22 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:22:35 I don't think so, bud. Where do you think you're heading? And sort of puts a hand on your chest and sort of pushes you back. Over here, Zariel, as you walk forward, you get to a certain point. And then at your neck, in a second, you have like a knife to your throat. And a female to your side goes, now, I remember inviting you to our box. But you guys have been effectively stepped in front of.
Kaladin Shash 00:23:03 At a quick glance, would I be able to notice anything that resembled what we're assuming now is the hand of God, the right hand sort of gently reaching forward, fingers curled up a little? Person right in front of me now. 17.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:04 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:23:16 on the main guy or the person in front of you. Go ahead and give me perception or investigation check. 17.
Dungeon Master 00:23:33 No, actually, you don't see anything on this person in front of you. This just seems to be a bouncer. They seem like a fighter. They could be one of the people like you don't understand the dynamic, but this guy doesn't have any sort of recognizable symbols on him.
Kaladin Shash 00:23:50 Okay. And is there currently a fight going on?
Dungeon Master 00:23:54 Yes, currently there's a fight between like a pretty lithe and thin like a middle-aged man who's balding on top and a very short and rotund like dwarven-esque woman and they're just beating the shit out of each other.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:15 Hmm. Can I do a perception check to see if the guy that we're moving towards matches the description that Leo's given and see if there's anything else I can kind of toss out? All right. Ooh, it was almost a natural 20.
Dungeon Master 00:24:32 Yeah, go for it. You are, I would say, a little too distracted with, you do have a blade to your throat. And do you sort of point to the person behind?
Zariel Torgan 00:24:46 Hmm. Well. Hmm.
Kaladin Shash 00:24:49 Friend we just wanted to, we just wanted to talk to the person right there. Do you want to meet him? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:25:02 He goes, yeah, and that's sort of the thing. You don't get to just talk to Cedric. Nobody speaks to the champ who hasn't earned it. You seem new here. Why don't you go talk to Ollie, the bartender, and he'll explain how this shit works. But other than that, step off, pig.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:22 Not knowing that we weren't going to have success with that. I'll just say like well, that's not very
Kaladin Shash 00:25:24 Oh my God, man. I just I just won't even sneer. Won't even react to it and I'll just turn around and start walking back towards. Do you say Ollie was the bartender? Make my way through the crowd.
Dungeon Master 00:25:35 All righty.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:48 hospitable of you. I just thought I recognized a friend over here. How would one seek an audience with that gentleman there? Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:26:03 Because I don't know that I've seen you before. You have to win your fight, and then if you win your fight, you have a chance to challenge.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:18 Methinks I have a bit of a plan cooking here. I'll be back and then I'll go meet them.
Kaladin Shash 00:26:27 Oh, it's Jonathan. Just a gauge is the bar. Is this bar right now? Pretty loud, pretty ruckus. That's OK, it's perfect. Perfect, perfect. Yeah. Perfect. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:26:33 Yeah, it is. Again, the empty map doesn't do it justice. But like picture up 100 more tokens in there of people chatting. And, you know, they're everybody's having like their one on one or small group chats, or they're watching the fight. But that's a lot of like added up audio, right? Like it's, it's, it's loud, it's ruckus, there's a ton of people, you have to like literally turn sideways and slide between people.
Kaladin Shash 00:26:58 I will touch the ruby on my uniform and say come to the bar.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:06 I'll head over. Just roll around.
Leopold Magnus 00:27:08 Yeah, Liv. Go ahead.
Dungeon Master 00:27:09 So you, do you finish your conversation with this woman or do you just, you hear that? It blasts full volume on your vest. Well, your armor plate, not a vest. It's not an actual walkie-talkie. But anyway, she hears that, like she just hears that voice go, come through the bar, and then you turn around and you walk away. You spin and walk.
Kaladin Shash 00:27:30 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:38 I think that one of us should try to fight one of the other ones of us. I don't know if we've all been connected to be obviously together, or just the people around the door. Maybe you two could fight, or me and Leo, or me and Kaladin.
Dungeon Master 00:27:38 You guys need.
Kaladin Shash 00:27:58 No, we're cheating. We have an ace in our sleeves. We'll just throw Rita Pold in the fighting pit. His AC is so high. I don't know what his bare-fisted action's like, but he's a plate of armor. Come on. Come on.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:08 Oh, that's a good point. Yeah, he's impossible to hit. That's a good point. Yeah, he's not a man. He's got no bare fists. Alright, so yeah, we'll head over.
Leopold Magnus 00:28:17 uh three damage
Kaladin Shash 00:28:23 May always only allows it. I don't know if I don't. There may be like he can't wait. Not OK. OK, we. We're at the bar. Holy. Wait.
Dungeon Master 00:28:42 You're at the bar. Yeah, you see this also fairly short and round, you know, more dwarven heritage and bloodline, large beard that fully covers his face. His cheeks kind of are permanently a little bit. Stop pulling up the pictures. They're just default.
Kaladin Shash 00:29:07 I love it.
Dungeon Master 00:29:11 That's not him. That's just the dude who looks somewhat like him. Somewhat like that, but with a more full beard and rosy cheeks. He is bald, but that's just a coincidence. You see, he speaks, and if he had a full voice, it'd be like rough, but it comes out more of a whisper, and he's just like, it's been a...
Zariel Torgan 00:29:13 You.
Dungeon Master 00:29:39 Sometimes since Legionnaire stepped in my bar. That's not right.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:47 Do we have any money? I was just thinking that, wait, Jonathan, I have 62 gold. Does that sound right? Or is that way off? OK.
Kaladin Shash 00:29:48 I have enough money to buy a couple drinks. I think I've got a couple of gold piece at least. We got, we got, we got money from. Yeah, no, no. Cause we got, we got the lottery ticket. We got the token and some gold from our job. We all have a little, I think. Yeah, I have 70 right now. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:15 Yeah, I've got 80.
Zariel Torgan 00:30:18 All right, cool. All right, sorry, continue. I was just thinking.
Dungeon Master 00:30:24 Now it's up to you guys. It's all on you. That's interesting. You seem to know his name, but you don't know how to talk to him. Ah.
Kaladin Shash 00:30:30 We're new to the Guard. We have a few questions to ask. How do we have the opportunity to speak with Cedric? We got to meet his friends already.
Dungeon Master 00:30:54 Yeah, they're fighters. Yeah, they're here often. Everybody wants to be famous, and this is how a lot of people make it out of this part of town. Yeah, you have to present a challenge, and then it has to be accepted. It's a weird little tradition we have. You win your fight, you see. You challenge Cedric, but he does get to pick. He doesn't always fight.
Kaladin Shash 00:31:05 I see, I see. Can anyone fight?
Dungeon Master 00:31:24 Sometimes he just wants to be social. Not with you, necessarily. He's sort of a big name in the fighting community. He's been at it a long time. But yeah, you just sort of walk up and you speak to like the bookie over there. Between the fighters, they decide.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:42 Is this, uh, bare knuckle? Or can we use a club or a sword or... Hmm. Alright. I'll take it. Yeah, I'll take a... jug of your finest mead.
Dungeon Master 00:31:58 Can I get you boys a drink or something? His face goes from like pleasantly professional and just very straight and blank. Yes, okay. Three beers coming up.
Kaladin Shash 00:32:03 Big assess. That's for real. Better.
Leopold Magnus 00:32:10 Do you happen to have any oil behind that bar? This little gear of mine is getting quite stuck.
Dungeon Master 00:32:30 Turns around, pours in large steins, puts them across the table. That'll be five silver for each. Thanks, boys. Keep the tab open.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:39 I'll lay it down. I got it. Just full cartoon character. Freaking everybody out.
Kaladin Shash 00:32:43 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:32:47 Oh, I'm buying the next round and I kind of start shaking my arm back and forth rapidly and coins start flying out between the like folds of my armor. Yeah. What's that? Well, that's a great question. What are you, sir?
Dungeon Master 00:33:02 Just looks at you. What are you? I'm a dude. I'm a bartend. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:33:16 My name is Calvin.
Leopold Magnus 00:33:17 Hmm. Indeed. And I'm splashing the, uh, the ale just kind of down the, uh, hatch, you know, it's kind of hitting my gears and whatnot.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:27 I'm gonna put us an empty glass just like try to catch a bunch of whatever's not going anywhere.
Dungeon Master 00:33:33 A lot of things happen at once. You. What's your name, sir? Calvin? I don't know. He proposes a challenge and one of the fighters accepts it.
Kaladin Shash 00:33:50 Yes, I have a question. Our friend, is he allowed to fight? He is. OK. Keep it open. Let's go. Leopold.
Dungeon Master 00:34:03 I'm sure it's fine.
Leopold Magnus 00:34:13 Oh, yes. And I'm like a coin kind of rolls out my sleeve and I put my arm down. A job for me. What did you have in mind?
Kaladin Shash 00:34:20 You have a job. Is that real? Do you think he can do it? Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:34:33 Well, there comes a time in every man or construction, I do think he can.
Kaladin Shash 00:34:48 Leopold, we need you to fight in the ring, that way we can talk to Cedric. It's hard, he hates fighting. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:34:53 Oh, oh, a fight. Oh, dear. Yes, I have seen some of those when I was a tyke in school. Quite violent, I will say. Leopold's just staring at his hands kind of like blankly. I mean, he's always blankly looking.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:04 What about the monsters we just fucking killed? We just killed and brutally murdered like four... Yeah, it's okay. Never mind.
Leopold Magnus 00:35:27 Yes, yes, indeed. There has been some more violent troubles in this adventure. Oh, dear. OK, yes, certainly I can give it a shot, although I hope I hope I don't accidentally kill them. And I go to take a drink out of my beer and this guy just crushes underneath my hand.
Kaladin Shash 00:35:27 Can you handle this? You just, yes, you just knock them out. It's not so bad.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:34 Don't kill these men or women or anything.
Leopold Magnus 00:35:55 And I'm trying to shake the cup out of my hand, but it's stuck in there. So it kind of flies off and hits somebody on the head in the crowd over here.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:04 All of our money is gonna be spent paying damages from everywhere we go.
Kaladin Shash 00:36:04 Okay, where's the bookie? Okay, the walk up to him. Hello, hello, close to the pit.
Dungeon Master 00:36:16 So you see him sort of by the entrance to the pit talking and handing out money and seems very busy and all that. So just Leopold goes over, or the whole group.
Leopold Magnus 00:36:30 Where is the bookie? Oh, over here.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:47 I wanna go, I wanna see what the over under and what the odds are. If they're taking odds on bets or anything. Before I bet on Leo, I wanna know what's all gonna shake down. Yeah, I'm just gonna be present, but I'm gonna wait to talk until something happens.
Kaladin Shash 00:36:47 Again. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:37:04 Okay, so you go over to. And you see this like,
Leopold Magnus 00:37:12 I walk up to the bookie and say, well, yes, hello, sir. I'm here to best a man in a match of fisticuffs and kind of stand fists in hand.
Kaladin Shash 00:37:20 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:37:31 gnomish figure, like pointy features, very small, super energetic, and he goes, hey, yeah, how can I help you? Oh, you want to meet, right? Okay, cool. What's your name? And you see very frantically, he goes, hey, cool, I've got you behind, and he points to two other people, and he says, once they're done, go ahead and, do you have somebody you're fighting? Are you challenging one of the ring fighters?
Leopold Magnus 00:37:42 Leopold Magnus at your service. Oh, yes, whoever must must is available is best for fighting for me.
Dungeon Master 00:38:05 All right, TBD, cool. Anything else? Yeah. He would get your information if you wanted to be introduced by anything, something like that. He asked if you want to put money on it. Do you want to buy in to potentially collect either way? Very obviously,
Kaladin Shash 00:38:12 So now, do we just have to wait now? Or he's still talking to Leopold?
Zariel Torgan 00:38:23 Are there any odds given on these bets? Does it depend on who he's fighting?
Dungeon Master 00:38:34 You could throw if you wanted. Yeah, it's decided once the match is set up.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:00 All right. Can we give Leo a cool stage name, like the Masked Unit or something cool like that? Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:39:01 We can wait until then. Oh, Bone Crusher, he's Bone Crusher!
Leopold Magnus 00:39:13 Well, if you remember back to our first or second session, he did have a nickname on the back of the suit of armor that he is unaware of himself. Bone Crusher. Yeah. I, of course, had no idea that even is on the back of my armor. I don't have a mirror. I can't look back there. That's great.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:33 Yeah, I drew a dick on there like six months ago, and there's no getting it off. No, I didn't do that. I wouldn't do that to you. Well, I mean, I think artistically Bone Crusher's a bit on the nose, but I mean, I won't complain. But we gotta give you a cool name.
Kaladin Shash 00:39:33 You're spiritual.
Leopold Magnus 00:40:02 Zario, you think I need a name, indeed? I have no idea. I'm not much of the fisticuffs myself, but, you know, I'm going along with it.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:13 I got a plan. We give you a really lame name, like Brokey McBroke Robot, and then all the bets, they're gonna be like, oh, well this guy is gonna be terrible. And then we bet big. See? Yeah, they're gonna look at that, they're gonna hear the call sheet, maybe a limp out there, can you give me a limp?
Kaladin Shash 00:40:30 He's got a bad name.
Leopold Magnus 00:40:31 Oh. I think I have something just for you, Zario. Jonathan, can I do like a little maybe magic tinkering or some kind of I don't know what it would be like, maybe a slight hand check. I'm going to try and undo a couple of pistons in my steam powered armor, you know, like some of the hydraulics just kind of like let the pressure off of one.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:00 So that way it doesn't quite function as effectively as it would. Yeah, yeah. For this bit, maybe I could suffer some penalties movement. The ring's not very big, right? I don't know if I have a specific tinkering.
Dungeon Master 00:41:06 Are you willing to mechanically handicap yourself? Okay, yeah, go ahead and give me, if you have a tinkering roll, make that, otherwise just give me a sleight of hand. It might tell you to make a specific check.
Kaladin Shash 00:41:11 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:29 Unless it's like an arcana or something. Oh, magical tinkering is just like, I could do, it's kind of separate from what I'm trying to do. You can imbue a non-magical object with magical properties. Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:41:42 Not your magical tiering. Do you have something that says, like, when you're proficient with certain tools, you can make this kind of check? Anything like that?
Leopold Magnus 00:41:59 I have these tinkerer tools, let me look them up really fast. Add my proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make using these tools. So, uh, then maybe I would make a slight a hand check. That seemed to make the most sense, but with my proficiency bonus,
Dungeon Master 00:42:29 Yeah, sounds good. It should be at like the top of your sheet. It's like a plus one or two at this point. Nine.
Leopold Magnus 00:42:30 Okay. And my proficiency bonus comes from where again? Sorry. Oh, plus two. Okay. So I have this plus two. Got it. Yeah. Pretty low. Yeah. So eight, nine. Oh, my decks is terrible. My sleight of hand is two. So it's definitely one of my weaker stats.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:46 Hmm. Is your sleight of hand zero? Oh, shit.
Dungeon Master 00:42:56 No, it's two. It's seven plus two. Yeah, it's nine. Maybe for the better mechanically, but less good for presentation-wise. You try to sort of, like, handicap yourself intentionally, and you're having a hard time causing, like, minimal damage that doesn't affect you outright. So you're like, you could try to fake it if you wanted to, but, like,
Leopold Magnus 00:43:01 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:43:24 If anything, you just have a little hinge in your step, like something that you feel catches, but maybe isn't super noticeable. But again, you could just lie. It rattles a little bit.
Leopold Magnus 00:43:31 Okay, got it. Oh, this damn thing, and I kind of rattle my leg around. I'm apologizing to you right now, Zariel. This is too well-made. But I could... I could try to give you my best.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:47 No, no, you gotta, no, stop saying it's good, it's bad. Just say it's bad, quit pulling yourself apart. Nobody knows what you, like normally, right? Like, oh, they're gonna be like, that gear's in the wrong spot. Nobody knows where your gears go. Just like, just like limp, like walk out and say like, ooh, I had a robot stroke and half my robot body don't work now. You know, something like that.
Leopold Magnus 00:44:05 OK, yes, all right. OK, Zaria, I will give it my best. So I'm going to do my best to kind of move around really slowly.
Kaladin Shash 00:44:14 You good?
Zariel Torgan 00:44:23 I believe in you. Now let's win some money. I'm gonna guide him.
Dungeon Master 00:44:30 You're sort of just setting up this scene. Yeah, go ahead. As you're sort of moving around slowly, really hamming it up so everybody observes that maybe even just like unconsciously, like it's just going through their brain without them realizing it, sort of the goal. Give me a perception check just to see if you notice something as you're moving through.
Leopold Magnus 00:44:38 Like I'm a hundred years old moving at a snail's pace. Oh, that is not great for me.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:05 I was giving you guidance for your acting, but I think technically you can use it for whatever you want. Oh, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
Kaladin Shash 00:45:09 You're funny.
Dungeon Master 00:45:16 It's sort of a passive check. He's not trying to do something. Yeah, I'm just leaving notices something nothing that you catch if you're more focused on sort of putting this deep lore about your body into the general crowd, really, really wrestling it up sort of WWE style. Zario, are you placing actual money? Are you? Are you going to be towards the bookie?
Leopold Magnus 00:45:21 OK.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:38 Mm-hmm. Well, I'm... Yeah, I'm gonna wait and see what the odds end up being. You know, once we announce his name. Have we decided? Yeah, like, uh... You know, like, Baby Bot. You know? Or like, uh...
Leopold Magnus 00:45:53 I don't know, what was my nickname? Junkie McJunk Pace or something? Ah, I've got it, Zario. Grandpa Bot. Yes, that will really sell the idea that I am old and decrepit.
Dungeon Master 00:45:54 Have you been home?
Kaladin Shash 00:45:56 Bone Crusher. It's fine. Just say that name.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:08 You know. That's good. Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:46:26 OK. Kaladin, are you doing anything during this time? Are you fighting? Are you watching? Are you betting? OK.
Kaladin Shash 00:46:30 Yeah, I'm going to put. Well. I'm assuming that he's I'm going to bet I'm assuming that Leopold's going to get through this first fight and then hopefully get accepted. For second fight.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:49 Just in case it doesn't go well, I will also sign up. But if it does go well, I'm just going to drop out. That way we don't have to go through that whole thing again, just so it's all set up. And my stage name will be Tuberculosis Jim.
Dungeon Master 00:46:59 Okay. Okay. The other fight ends spectacularly. This like super tall, very like,
Kaladin Shash 00:47:02 Got me.
Leopold Magnus 00:47:13 Okay, that's great.
Dungeon Master 00:47:28 hairy like equivalent of. Like bugbear ancestry just like really really hairy dude. Just like beats up who like ends up being like you see can see is this brand they sort of leave the arena and good spirits or limbs missing a tooth as they head towards the bar and then. The bookie steps forward and.
Kaladin Shash 00:47:37 Hello.
Dungeon Master 00:47:52 losing sort of the franticness, pulls up like an arcane microphone speaker and goes, ladies and gentlemen. And everybody sort of quiets down as you get introduced. And he says, for our next match, we have. He looks down, realizes that he didn't have anything actually decided from you, and looks up to you, Leopold, who are standing there at the side and goes, kid, what's your name?
Zariel Torgan 00:48:02 That's nice.
Kaladin Shash 00:48:18 Who's the guidance on that? Who's that guy? Come on.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:20 Oh, I'm just old grandpa, but me, I'm feeble. I do not belong in these pits. Okay. All right, what's the guidance, D4? Okay. It'd be a little better.
Dungeon Master 00:48:32 Give me a performance check. Like really quiet, actually. It's kind of awkwardly quiet. You hear somebody clear their throat.
Zariel Torgan 00:48:35 Use that guidance now. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:48:49 No.
Leopold Magnus 00:49:02 Anyways, these old gears, they haven't spun in years. My gyroscopic stabilizer has been all out of whack. I can hardly balance.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:16 I'm gonna yell out, five gold on the other guy, just to get the ball rolling.
Dungeon Master 00:49:25 You hear the guy goes, please, no bets yet, sir. All right. And who are you fighting? And he points, and you see stepping up, that female is at one corner.
Leopold Magnus 00:49:29 Anyways, grandpa bought some name. I just, you know, I ran out of my pension funds and I need some extra money. So.
Kaladin Shash 00:49:37 you.
Dungeon Master 00:49:49 That man that had stopped Zariel is, well no, that was actually Kaladin, very large, like at least 6'6", 6'7", bald head, very, you can tell he's got like Goliath ancestry.
Dungeon Master 00:50:11 It seems to have like spiked knuckles like wrapped around his like tight leather wraps around his knuckles that are spiked. He steps up at the other corner and it seems to be the two of them who are willing to take your fight. Yes, they both stepped up when you didn't have something already arranged.
Leopold Magnus 00:50:33 I'm fighting one or the other here. Oh, I see. Oh, no, dear. Well, I suppose I could potentially brawl with the with the young lady in the mask over there.
Dungeon Master 00:50:59 And she bows politely and then she, because it's too loud to hear everybody sort of chattering and talking and the announcers looking to her and she sort of holds her dagger up above her head into the side a little bit and sort of just shakes it a bit, sort of like signaling to you that she is going to use that and that you should take
Dungeon Master 00:51:23 something else to fight with or what are you fighting with like you're not sure but she's showing you that that's her weapon and you guys are I don't know how far is this you're like 30 feet away from each other it seems to be that that's what she wants to fight with
Kaladin Shash 00:51:31 What question question, are they allowed to use anything in the fight? Is anything allowed in the fight? Oh man.
Leopold Magnus 00:51:44 Mmm.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:45 Does she, does she, I know obviously in the, in the photo here, she's got like a thing of power in her hand. Can we discern whether or not she has any magical stuff or looks to be magical in nature in any way?
Dungeon Master 00:52:01 No, nothing obvious. That's just the photo. You're looking for like an insight?
Zariel Torgan 00:52:04 Um, based on what I've seen, could I make, like, an insight check or something to see whether or not me casting Flame Blade on a weapon that we gave him would be, like, uncool? Yeah, just, like, the general vibe. Like, in all of the fights, have we seen anybody do anything magical? Um, and you know what? I'll just wait.
Dungeon Master 00:52:32 No, everything you've seen so far is has been just like fisticuffs.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:39 Okay, yeah, I'll wait. I'll just wait. This isn't the big one anyway, this is the little one, so if we're gonna blow stuff, it'd be later. I'm good.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:57 Okay, um I kind of look over across the crowd nice here with the knife and I kind of look over at the other two guys and I kind of go, are you freaking serious right now? Are you gonna fight this chick? Um, but I'm like, oh these old hips and I kind of push them and you hear this kind of snapping noise What's that?
Kaladin Shash 00:53:11 That is the most discreet you've ever been. Do that more. That is good. If you can't handle it, we will help you.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:12 but but
Leopold Magnus 00:53:27 And so then I kind of try and slap my hand maybe a bit, and the automatic crossbow kind of pops out. It looks maybe a little dusty. Or maybe I'll try and make it look a little dusty.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:45 What are the bets now that old Mr. Robot's fighting this chick? Alright, I'm gonna bet every bit of gold that I have. 62.
Dungeon Master 00:53:51 The announcer yells that there are three to one odds against, obviously, Grandpa Bot. You said you had how much? 62 even, so you did well.
Kaladin Shash 00:53:55 All right.
Leopold Magnus 00:54:01 Well, OK, so if we were going to go in on this together, could have I slipped in my gold?
Dungeon Master 00:54:16 uh 186 plus your 62 original so you know 248 Lee was established when he just dumped his gold into his mouth
Kaladin Shash 00:54:26 We need to feed him a bag of holding.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:27 Yeah. It would probably make sense that one of us would be carrying both of our gold, Leo, because you don't have pockets. Oh, shit. OK. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:54:39 Yeah, I just have a chamber of items that rattle around. And I guess that would make it really awkward to get rid of it. That would be that would be a good day.
Kaladin Shash 00:54:54 So he's just always reaching into his mouth to pull something incredible out. Yeah, I'll put 50 gold on it.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:59 Yeah, I love that. That's fantastic.
Dungeon Master 00:55:13 Awesome, so you would get a 200 even back. If you were to win. Cool. Anything else you like you do or we just going to get right to the fight?
Leopold Magnus 00:55:33 Uh...
Zariel Torgan 00:55:33 Um... Yeah, I'm good. Nice.
Kaladin Shash 00:55:33 No, I'm going to be really discreet, but as the fight starts, I'm going to cast Bless so I can get through this first one a little easier. Or should I save that? I'll cast it on this one. Make it look savage. Maybe that'll entice the guy to fight.
Dungeon Master 00:56:01 Are you casting Bless on Leo, then? Okay. Okay, you all get Bless. No Long Rest, so you have used it.
Kaladin Shash 00:56:03 Yes. I'll cast it on all of us. Just because. Just in case something crazy happens. Or yeah, I need to escape or whatever. We got 10 minutes.
Zariel Torgan 00:56:11 Oh. Like, we start murking these random citizens.
Leopold Magnus 00:56:19 Jonathan, can you remind me, have I used this all or nothing coin on this day? Did we have a long rest in between? Got it. Okay. Yeah, so I just kind of shuffle into the arena, bent at more or less a 90 degrees angle, looking kind of down at the ground and I go, oh,
Leopold Magnus 00:56:50 I hope this is worth the money.
Dungeon Master 00:56:57 Uh, and you should be in the, uh, now announcer, but also bookie steps in and does his whole ladies and gentlemen talk. And he goes, I bring you any, and you already know grandpa and everybody's pretty solid. And he goes fighting last night's overall champion. And he goes, Oh, Laura, the serpent. And everybody starts and cheering and, ah, and everybody starts placing their bets.
Dungeon Master 00:57:23 And then, unless something is going to happen, go ahead and roll initiative for both, just you and her, and then Kaladin and Zarya. If you want to have regular things, like opportunities to do something, you can roll initiative too.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:38 All right.
Leopold Magnus 00:57:42 Bye-bye.
Dungeon Master 00:57:58 Okay. We have 20, 19, 18, and 13. Perfect. Okay. Up first, Zariel, before the fight even kicks off, you have an opportunity to do something.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:16 Um... I mean... I don't think it's a good idea for me to do anything, so I'm probably just gonna... chill. For now.
Dungeon Master 00:58:33 Okay, it is then Alara. She, not wasting any time, dashes in, and she's got 30 feet of movement. My stuff is not showing me, measuring it now. Perfect, okay. She gets right up into your defenses, recognizing that you have
Kaladin Shash 00:58:38 Yeah. This is 20.
Dungeon Master 00:59:01 A crossbow is what you held out, so she sort of waited and thought you're not likely to be good at close combat. She's going to go ahead and take a few tacks on you. You see her dagger moves lightning quick and she goes one, two and three at your knee to try to hit you. Yes, first one is 19 to hit.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:21 Okay, regular attacks. Misses. Yeah, let me double check. Okay, so I can use shield, can't I, as a reaction?
Zariel Torgan 00:59:31 Crazy Oh Jesus
Dungeon Master 00:59:37 Second one is 22 to hit. If you'd like to, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:51 Yeah, so I'll cast Shield as a reaction. And so I'll kind of be looking fairly decrepit and vulnerable, and her first attack just chips off my armor. The second attack, I just kind of whirl into action and Matrix-style dodge the blade, pushing her hand just slightly out of my way. And cast Shield. And then that will miss.
Kaladin Shash 00:59:53 Yes. Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:00:17 Uh, a depth. So OK, hold on. Does your shield manifest you as you being somebody from the matrix? OK. Uh, 12 and what is your AC with shield?
Leopold Magnus 01:00:25 It just manifests in a way that my armor is almost unnaturally fast at adjusting where it's at. Like it gets juiced up real fast. 26.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:46 Jesus Christ. Natural 20 is the only thing that hits at that. That's crazy.
Dungeon Master 01:00:47 Okay, so even the 24 missed is. It is your turn. Leopold, you are up next.
Kaladin Shash 01:00:48 Put it through him in there. Yeah, he's got he's got it until the end of his next term.
Leopold Magnus 01:01:10 Oh yeah, like torso spinning like it's hot, kind of comes back slowly into rotation and looks at this lady and goes, Oh dear. Oh my, it's been years since I've had a great fight. I don't think I want to do much of this. And I back off and I call down, uh, like I kind of kneel down into a ball and the steel defender coming out of my armor folds up and stands right in front of me.
Zariel Torgan 01:01:41 Fight my grandson! I lose my money! You gotta get my money taken!
Leopold Magnus 01:01:45 Yeah. Performance or charisma.
Dungeon Master 01:01:46 Go ahead and give me a general charisma check as you sort of basically just call in a different fighter instead. Charisma.
Dungeon Master 01:02:10 Uh, the crowd hates it, man. You're getting boos. People are like... What's your... What's a six? What's... So it's just a six then. It's a six plus nothing. Uh, you're not a fan... The fan is not a crowd of you. The crowd is not a fan of you. I got there.
Kaladin Shash 01:02:11 Desert decks those a deck Those decks There you go cheater put that thing away you had him you had her already ma'am
Leopold Magnus 01:02:15 What was that? Oh, that was my text. Hold on. Although charisma is much worse. It's a plus zero. Yeah. Oh, oh dear. I do not like getting my hands wet.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:29 Oh, no.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:44 Okay, standby, mister. And that was my action to call forth my steel defender. He'll be there if necessary. And then my bonus action, I'll use a magic stone.
Leopold Magnus 01:03:11 So I'll cast Magic Stone for my bonus action. And that's my...
Dungeon Master 01:03:16 Okay. End of your turn. It has been Caledon's turn.
Kaladin Shash 01:03:25 I just shot him. You have to fight. You have to do it. I'll move. I'll move a little bit. I'm going to kind of move to like just middle of middle of ring. That's all I'm doing. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:03:51 Is that all you're doing? Okay, cool. I'm listening, but I have to go grab something from the front porch for Travis. They're not home. Zariel, it is you up next. What do you want to do?
Kaladin Shash 01:04:02 All right.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:06 Um... I'll probably just go get another drink from the bar. I have total faith in Leo to just womp this chick.
Dungeon Master 01:04:22 Yeah, as you go up to the bar, Ollie goes just sort of... In his whispery voice, he's just enjoying the fight.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:47 Well, back where I'm from, we don't do much fighting. Well, I can't really remember, but, uh... Well, it doesn't matter. Yeah, it's fine. Yeah, put your money on the robot. Then I'll get the drink and go back. I'll get one for Kaladin, too. I'll just chill with Kaladin.
Kaladin Shash 01:05:06 Excellent. Just give them really. Yes, you are.
Dungeon Master 01:05:08 Give me a perception check. All righty. Is bless ability checks or is it saving throws and attack rolls?
Zariel Torgan 01:05:20 Perception, huh? 13. Oh, I'm blessed, aren't I? 15. D'oh!
Kaladin Shash 01:05:38 I think it's all three, man. Every round. Let me see. Nope, attack and saving. Only attack and saving. No checks. No checks. No checks.
Dungeon Master 01:05:45 15, don't notice anything. Right there, I thought so. In the next round, a lot of them, a little frustrated. You should have. So you are, so are you standing behind your steel defender?
Zariel Torgan 01:05:52 Oh, then it was only a 13. I should have guided myself.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:10 Well, yeah, after I saw the crowd sneer at me, I realized that that's actually going to come down to the medal. And I instructed him to stand by just kind of as a referee.
Dungeon Master 01:06:25 Okay, I'm gonna try to find something just for interim. They're just like, I don't know what to say. Anyway, okay, so I'll find something for it. Oh, let's do this. This is your still defender.
Kaladin Shash 01:06:36 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:06:54 So she doesn't step around it then she goes right back into your space and you hear she's a little frustrated She does like a small dash down left and then takes again three more strikes, you know Waste tries to get underneath the shoulder into like the armpit and then again, it's your other foot She can only hit at max with And that quantity you have and you still have the increased AC so we'll just do First one misses
Leopold Magnus 01:06:54 Well.
Kaladin Shash 01:07:11 Good morning.
Dungeon Master 01:07:28 Second one misses. And third one misses. It is your turn. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:35 Okay. Um, yep. So with my action, uh, you have disadvantage for range spells, right? If they're within that space. Okay. Um, yeah, I, uh, yeah, that's a good idea. I'm going to brush pastor and run down to the other side of the arena.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:49 I'd run, dude. I mean, she can't possibly hit you even if you, you know.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:04 And I will take aim with my crossbow. Yep. And then I'll take aim with my crossbow and fire. 20 to hit.
Dungeon Master 01:08:16 Okay, she's obviously going to take that. Attempt to hit you, nope, misses. Okay, you move all the way down. A 20 just hits.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:36 I see 11 damage on that. Excellent. Yeah. Oh, I have blood so I could I could add it to my next attack. Yep. Okay, so that was my action and with the floating stones around me one's kind of hovers in midair dials in on the target and launches and I will
Zariel Torgan 01:08:36 Oh! Just hits, holy smokes. Jesus! Dilderude.
Kaladin Shash 01:08:45 It was a good hit. Back up.
Dungeon Master 01:08:47 That's a good hit. This will be good. Yes, it is.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:06 Unleash a Magic Stone. I don't think that would hit, even with Bluffs, right? Yep. Okay, that was my attack action and bonus action. That's my turn.
Kaladin Shash 01:09:17 Yeah, it'll miss. Very good, Leopold. Keep it up. While everybody's fighting, can I look directly across the pit at other people that are sort of engaging or watching? Do I see anyone?
Dungeon Master 01:09:17 Yeah, I wouldn't hit. All right, Kaladin, you're up. What are you doing while this is happening?
Kaladin Shash 01:09:48 with like a hand of the God on them or something recognizable. 14, not really. That's it, I'm just gonna keep concentrating.
Dungeon Master 01:09:55 Give me another perception check. No, not really. Okay, okay. Sorrel, you're up.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:19 I'm just gonna turn to Kaladin and be like, so we're pretty confident that guy over there, he's like, one of the cult guys, right? Do you wanna just like, go fuck him up? Or, I mean, we don't really have to follow the rules. Oh, okay. All right. You're right, I put a lot of money on this fight, so at the very least we'll wait till this is done.
Kaladin Shash 01:10:30 Yes, I think so. That is plan B. That is plan B. Yes.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:53 All right, all right, yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right, I'm being rash. I'll wait, and then I'll just sit back down, or stand, I guess we're standing.
Dungeon Master 01:11:07 Alrighty, it is. Alara is gonna dash forward, close the space again, attempt to sort of push you up against the back wall so you don't have an easy way out. But she's just gonna try her three attacks. You do not have the shield, right? Okay, first one misses anyway. Second one also misses anyway.
Kaladin Shash 01:11:25 Here's your reaction. Yeah, boy.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:25 A pear pear. Oof.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:26 Yep, no shield. Oh, that hits. No, no shield this time.
Dungeon Master 01:11:37 Uh, 23 to hit. Uh, any shield? Uh, you take 11 points of, uh,
Dungeon Master 01:11:53 Dabbing damage as she the first you miss and she seems to be going for the common theme She's just trying to find a weak point. Maybe she noticed the hinge in your knee you tried to sort of portray and the third strike her dagger goes into your Like knee area with the joint of your armor and the knee and it sort of cripples you for a second bringing you down That is the end of her turn though It is now your turn
Leopold Magnus 01:12:20 Son of a bitch this is this is quite heinous And I I push off let's see what's the 20 feet Okay, yeah, I I'm gonna push away from her To this corner
Zariel Torgan 01:12:26 book.
Dungeon Master 01:12:48 As you try to dash away, she stabs out a 24 to hit. And you take 9 damage on that one.
Leopold Magnus 01:12:56 Yeah, that hits as well. Jesus. All right. And so after backing myself in the corner, I will then cast grease in a 10 foot line, kind of cutting this section off.
Leopold Magnus 01:13:24 It is 10 foot square, so I think I can cover. Right, I should be able to basically cover that whole area, right? So that way there's no, I can't quite draw the right box, but how can I move these?
Dungeon Master 01:13:43 Mhm. If it's drawn, you can't. What is it? What's the like the area of it?
Leopold Magnus 01:13:54 Oh shit, how do I undraw? Erase. Uh, yeah, it's it's difficult to. It's it's Greece. It's a it's a 10 foot square. So like if this ruler is says it's 10 feet here, right? Like basically from wall to wall. In the corner.
Dungeon Master 01:14:23 Okay, so that'll be their crease there. That's a 10 foot square and you can sort of put it
Leopold Magnus 01:14:24 I'm trying to block her advance off so she can't just go around it.
Dungeon Master 01:14:49 In reality, you'd be able to put it on a diagonal too, so you can put it with sort of facing flat line against you. So you can put it a little bit closer and make it harder to get to you. Misses.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:01 Right, yeah, that was kind of my intention. Okay, that's my action. Bonus action, I will use Magic Stone. Fuck. Miss.
Dungeon Master 01:15:18 poofs in the sand behind her, throwing it up in the air. Kaladin, it's your turn. Seems to be sitting in the stool, his feet sort of up on the bars about halfway up so that he can also lean forward with his elbows on his knees, sort of giving himself support. And he seems to just be watching the fight.
Kaladin Shash 01:15:25 What is Cedric doing this whole time?
Kaladin Shash 01:15:58 Okay. Yeah, I've got nothing right now. Just watching, getting a little nervous. Is it enter?
Dungeon Master 01:16:13 OK, Zahra, your turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:16 I'm going to tip back my tankard of ale too far and fall backwards. And while I do, I'm going to cast Healing Word. I'm going to try to do it not to be subtle, like I'm being small with my movements, even though it's just verbal. I just want to draw attention from my mouth and my sounds.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:43 Do I need to make some sort of check? Because it's just verbal, not verbal somatic. Performance, perception. You said performance, persuasion, and what? Oh, deception. No, they're all the same.
Dungeon Master 01:16:48 Is there a difference between your deception and your persuasion or performance or by chance? Not persuasion, performance or deception. They should all be charisma. OK, so that will just be a general check with one of those, so like your charisma modifier to sort of play it off.
Kaladin Shash 01:16:56 You're still blessed. God wants you to save.
Dungeon Master 01:17:17 Because you're still making like a spell sound. OK. No, it's not a save. OK. Do you feel like you did a pretty good job?
Zariel Torgan 01:17:18 I guide myself. Oh, I'm blessed. OK. Well, that's a check, not a save. All right. So we're looking at 14. All right.
Kaladin Shash 01:17:26 This is a save, right? No. No. 14
Zariel Torgan 01:17:49 I'm just gonna say, uh, Leo. Try to heal him. Six healing. Then I'll just kind of pick myself up and dust myself off and then just, oh, that was, phew, whoa, that was strange. Did, uh, did Kaladin notice that terrible performance?
Leopold Magnus 01:17:56 Oh, nice. Could be one more hit.
Kaladin Shash 01:18:18 Of course. It's actually okay, I think. 14. I'm also a wizard. That was sloppy. I don't deal there. Keep doing. Keep doing it.
Dungeon Master 01:18:18 Caledon, what's your path of perception? You noticed it exactly.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:28 Oh. Meets it, beats it, yeah. Well you know, I just don't want to lose that money. That's all for my turn. I'm good.
Dungeon Master 01:18:52 OK. A large turn. She dashes forward. What is the grease do as she enters into it? Dex save is.
Leopold Magnus 01:19:05 Let me yeah, it's difficult train and yeah, they have to make a deck save all or nothing about it. She's probably pretty dexterous That might fail we're oh, yeah, it's a DC 14. Oh
Kaladin Shash 01:19:06 Difficult terrain. Ooh. Feels like a fail.
Zariel Torgan 01:19:07 Dex save. Nice. She dies.
Dungeon Master 01:19:22 Nine. What happens if you fail? She falls prone, so she had 10 feet of movement left. She has to use half of her movement to stand back up, so she only has five feet. It is difficult terrain.
Leopold Magnus 01:19:35 Deck saving throw, fall prone and die. Yep.
Zariel Torgan 01:19:39 Yeah, insta-death.
Kaladin Shash 01:19:39 Top notch.
Dungeon Master 01:19:52 uh which means it takes double movement so she can't technically get within range of you so she will hold her action yes
Leopold Magnus 01:20:04 Okay, let's see. Grease affects me too, right? Yeah. Okay, but what's that? Yeah, I was gonna say, I don't have a penalty, right? Okay.
Kaladin Shash 01:20:17 You should be able to. You should be able to. You should be able to attack from right there. Not in melee. Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:20:24 But she's 10. She's like technically 10 feet like she's just outside of reach. With degrees. And do it.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:32 For my action, I will cast a Firebolt. Presumably she's covered in grease. I'll target her, and we'll see. 22 to hit. Firebolt slaying off. 8 damage on that one.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:52 Nice. Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:21:00 Do you get extra damage if they're covered in grease? Doesn't grease afford you more?
Leopold Magnus 01:21:05 I don't know. I guess that was him. What's that? Slick grease covers the ground, difficult terrain. If you enter it, you have to have a deck saving throw there. I guess there's nothing specific about fire. Yeah. So nevermind. That was just, that was just me imagining things from playing video games, I think.
Kaladin Shash 01:21:07 You should just tap on grease, it'll tell you what it does. It may involve burning for two rounds or something. Okay, no. Grease fire. I love it, it's okay. It should apply extra damage.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:34 Heh heh heh
Leopold Magnus 01:21:35 At any rate, she is hit with Fireball, and then I will use for my bonus action, Magic Stone, make an attempt. Okay. Oh, damn. Okay. So 13 damage on that hit. And then
Kaladin Shash 01:21:37 I agree. 13.
Dungeon Master 01:21:47 We can just follow the rules for oil. Because if somebody's using oil, they take an extra five additional damage. Gotcha, she catches on fire.
Leopold Magnus 01:22:06 Okay, she's on fire. Magic stone to hit. Bless might do it. For fuck's sake. Oh, okay, I love a 20, sweet. Seven damage on the stone.
Kaladin Shash 01:22:14 Get it over the top. Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:22:21 19 is her AC. Nice. There, looking hurt. Looking hurt and on fire.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:47 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 01:22:47 Um, so then with my movement, since I'm out of attack range, I'm going to try and skirt the outside here, this grease. I know I'll take the penalty for moving through it. So, uh, yeah, I was going to say like, well, I guess what's the distance. So it would only be like five or so feet on that corner, I guess. I don't know. Yeah. 10 feet. Right.
Kaladin Shash 01:22:59 We jump.
Dungeon Master 01:22:59 I'm going to take the deck save. To get completely through it, it's 10 feet, so that would cost you 20 feet.
Leopold Magnus 01:23:19 Yeah, which I have the movement, I guess, in jump speed is what? I can't really make a long jump, right, because I need to wind up to do it. OK. Yeah, 15 strength. Yeah, I'll try and jump over that.
Dungeon Master 01:23:29 Uh, you. Yeah, but even standing jump. I think you have more than 10. I'm not going to look up the calculator so you could just jump. You've got a 15 strength rate like you're decently strong. Yeah, yeah, you can make that. She's going to use her held reaction.
Leopold Magnus 01:23:50 bit of grease, and then, okay. Ooh, good one. Okay. Yeah, 24 minutes.
Dungeon Master 01:23:57 Since you never entered her range, she's just going to throw her dagger at your back as you pass. That is a natural 18 to his for a total of 24. Because it is now a thrown weapon, she does less damage.
Kaladin Shash 01:24:20 Do you want a shield?
Dungeon Master 01:24:25 You take eight points of piercing. Yeah, clutch.
Leopold Magnus 01:24:27 Good thing for that heel. Yeah, I'll move away to this other corner, basically putting as much grease distance between her and I, if that makes sense. So basically, if she wanted to come out, she'd have to move through as much grease as possible to get it off and hit on me.
Kaladin Shash 01:24:58 I roll another perception check, just like a kind of a scanning the crowd. See if I see any else with the hand of the hands of God mark on them. 13
Dungeon Master 01:24:59 Nice, nice, nice. OK. End of your turn, Kaladin. It's your go. Go for it.
Dungeon Master 01:25:27 Maybe you think to yourself you might need to pursue a different option. You're not really seeing anything every time you check. At the top of the round, everybody give me a perception check. Just as something happens.
Kaladin Shash 01:25:34 Yeah. Yeah. Zadiel. Oh, bless. You can throw bless on top of those. Let's pump that up.
Leopold Magnus 01:25:52 Rob again. Might as well, but I don't know what's changing.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:53 It's a check. Sorry, it's very tempting.
Dungeon Master 01:26:02 It's a perception. It's not a city. 23 is great. Sorry, you'll you notice.
Kaladin Shash 01:26:04 No, it's a check. Sorry, check. Darn it. I keep getting really excited about the checks. 23 is great.
Dungeon Master 01:26:28 Cedric, the figure at the end of the fighting pit leaning forward, his eyes flash over gold really quick and he seems to wave his hand at the two fighters. Simultaneously, it seems, Leopold, you, let me roll it, you gain 10 hit points.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:33 Mhm.
Dungeon Master 01:26:59 And you guys noticed that Alara seems to have like a slight golden aura sort of emanate off her body too at the same time as Cedric has seemed a little more interested in this fight.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:19 be really funny if I just started yelling, he's cheating! Does that bring it to my turn? He's not looking good. I'm going to focus less on being
Dungeon Master 01:27:29 Mm-hmm. Is that your turn? He healed 10 HP, so he should be at 15.
Leopold Magnus 01:27:44 Oh yeah, I'll go ahead and add that.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:51 I'm going to be less worried about being subtle then. I'm just going to cough into... Actually, you know what? I'm going to take my empty tankard and I'm going to do a Bane voice. I'm just going to say, eww. But I'm going to try to be sneaky. I'm not as worried about it though, because he did it.
Kaladin Shash 01:28:06 Uncertain. It's me.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:13 So, do we get the impression that she, she was healed too, right? Got it.
Dungeon Master 01:28:30 Sorry, I was muted. You, Zariel, you feel that maybe you're one of the only people who maybe noticed that? So if you're trying to be less obvious about it. 16 is pretty good, though. 30, 20. Leopold, you heal five more.
Kaladin Shash 01:28:38 you.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:40 Oh. Well, I'm gonna use guidance then. That's a dirty 20 to not get noticed. Yeah. No, that's it for me. That's everything.
Dungeon Master 01:29:04 Anything else on your turn, sir? Perfect. Alara's go. Does she have to make a deck save any time she tries to move in the grease? Okay. That sounds right.
Leopold Magnus 01:29:04 Excellent, thank you. Yeah, I think it's like if she starts or ends her turn. Let me double check it. Each creature standing in its area must see the Dex save.
Kaladin Shash 01:29:25 I think it's just when you move in it or enter.
Leopold Magnus 01:29:32 A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dex saving throw.
Dungeon Master 01:29:38 OK, 19 so she doesn't fall prone. So difficult terrain, so 5 feet of movement to get out is 10. She's got 20 feet left. So she'll go there. She can get just right to there, so she'll use her action. To dash if she gets to her dagger in your back and she'll use her object interaction to grab her weapon. And that is her folder.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:07 Oh dear, ah! Oh, these bones! Uh, and... Uh, yeah, uh, Leopold has no, uh, close quarter combat capabilities, so... I will... Melee range, I guess it
Dungeon Master 01:30:08 Leopold, your turn. She just goes, stop it and just fight me. Quit running.
Kaladin Shash 01:30:13 Mm-hmm.
Zariel Torgan 01:30:19 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:37 Take disadvantage. I have magic stone.
Zariel Torgan 01:30:48 Did I, sorry, did I get the impression that Kaladin saw him heal them? Is it, is it too late for me? I didn't think about it in the moment to kind of like say that I like shoulder checked him to kind of like
Kaladin Shash 01:30:48 How many more? No, my perception. Directly perception. Do you ask this to you? Mine was like a 13, I think you're. I'm pretty soft. Yeah, plus. Yeah, I'm not wearable.
Dungeon Master 01:30:55 Good hero. Yours was a nine. Did not notice. So it's too late for that.
Zariel Torgan 01:31:17 point him in the direction of, you know, him noticing that, or is that too late? Okay, that's fine. I just thought about it just now. Alright.
Dungeon Master 01:31:28 Hi. OK. Correct.
Kaladin Shash 01:31:29 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:31:33 Um, yeah, so, what I'm going to do is, I'm gonna, uh, kind of push her back just at arm's reach and pull up my crossbow and try to, try to land a hit. Um, and that's with disadvantage, because I'm within melee range, right? Uh, yeah. Not gonna hit.
Dungeon Master 01:32:00 Oh, you might hit with less. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:32:04 Good point Hey, it's 19 right to hit Okay, so I'll say well fine then take this and I'll point my crossbow right right in her face and just dome her Nine damage on that
Zariel Torgan 01:32:07 Yeah, it's 50-50. Nice. Gonna shoot somebody's eye out.
Kaladin Shash 01:32:22 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:32:31 Nice. Yep.
Leopold Magnus 01:32:36 Um, uh... What do I do with my bonus action? I used, I think, the third magic stone, so... Bonus action's limited to... casting magic stone. Um... Wait, does that ha- No, that can be a bonus action. So I'll use my bonus action to cast magic stone.
Kaladin Shash 01:32:57 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:33:06 Pulled another three pebbles out of the arena. Waiting in the wings. And that's my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:33:19 Oh, you see that? She just took this bolt into the face. She's got like a bolt sticking out of her cheekbone and she's snarling. Oh, it's not even her turn. I'm getting ahead of myself. It is Kaladin's turn. She's going to do something fun on her turn. You can see she's getting ready.
Kaladin Shash 01:33:33 Yeah, it's okay. I believe it. I have nothing, I just have nothing to help right now other than to hold bless. Can't really, can't really cheat too much. I'm gonna, I'm gonna go roll another perception check just to check the crowd.
Kaladin Shash 01:34:01 Just rolling them real soft, they get one lower each time. All right. Keep fighting, you're doing good.
Dungeon Master 01:34:05 Yep, still don't notice anything. Top of the round, Zariel, you are up, sir.
Zariel Torgan 01:34:24 I'm gonna relay the information I didn't relay about him healing and all that. And I'm actually just gonna hold for now. I don't think there's anything I can do without draining myself past the point that I'd like to be drained. So I'm just gonna chill.
Dungeon Master 01:34:46 Okay. It is Alara's turn. You see, radiating a little bit better. She looks more confident. She feels, uh, she shouldn't feel anything other than bad because she is actively on fire, which is something I realized. So I made her take some damage from that.
Dungeon Master 01:35:04 But with that, she sort of is a little panicky, but she kind of wants to end this. So she looks to this sort of grease trap out here. She's going to throw her hand in it, and the whole grease thing catches on fire. She'll grapple you, Leopold. So go ahead and give me a poise athletics check.
Kaladin Shash 01:35:25 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:35:36 That would just be... just athletics, roll for athletics. Oof. Or do I roll a strength check, I guess? I got... ah, they're plus two, both. Yep.
Dungeon Master 01:35:46 Yeah, they're going to be the same. She got a 19 and she is also blessed. Versus your seven, you see she grapples you. She then pulls you at half movement and tosses you into this fire pit with her.
Kaladin Shash 01:36:04 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:36:16 so that you'll both start taking damage with that. Go ahead and give me a Dexterity saving throw as you enter it for the first time. Nice! You do not fall prone, but you are still standing on fire. She will then use her other two attacks to just try to do some more damage to you.
Leopold Magnus 01:36:26 Oh, 18. 21.
Dungeon Master 01:36:49 17. What is your current AC? It's 20, right? 21. Okay, she'll have to get a 4 to hit with Bless. She got a 4. So she just hits unless you shield.
Leopold Magnus 01:37:02 All right. No. I'm out of spell slots. We didn't take a long rest before. I might use a spell slot for something.
Kaladin Shash 01:37:09 Can you only use it once or do you just not want to burn your level once? There we go.
Dungeon Master 01:37:21 You take 9 points of damage. And she'll fully miss with her last attack. At the end of her turn, she takes 1d6 fire damage. She takes 4 more points. She's looking pretty hurt. You guys are in similar boats.
Dungeon Master 01:37:52 Leopold, you are up, sir. You can.
Leopold Magnus 01:37:57 Okay. Let's see. I kind of look over at my still defender and maybe shoot him a glance. And can I have him Harry her so I can get just a flat roll instead of being at disadvantage? Okay. And then I will use my hand crossbow to attack.
Kaladin Shash 01:38:16 Awesome. Ooh. Finisher.
Leopold Magnus 01:38:27 Oh, baby, that's what I needed. That 20, yep. Ah, it's a weak fucking roll. I think I got an 11 with a not regular, but anyway, eight damage. Oh, okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:30 Nice. Well, the plus five's doubled too, isn't it? So it's 13.
Dungeon Master 01:38:31 Natural 20. Bam. And that's, yeah. Maybe 13. 8. 8 plus 5.
Kaladin Shash 01:38:46 Doubled, yeah. You did much better, so it's four, 14, right? 10, no, 13, 16, what is it? Eight doubled, 16? Oh, 13, roger that.
Leopold Magnus 01:39:01 That's already double on the rolls. So 13 damage. She's looking pretty hurt. Go ahead and try what I have left. I'm going to use my magic stone. I'm going to throw a fucking rock at her. Let's see.
Dungeon Master 01:39:02 Because the d6 are doubled, so it's plus 5, plus 5. So it's 13 more. Looking very hurt, but still there.
Zariel Torgan 01:39:19 You're a rock adder. Nice.
Kaladin Shash 01:39:21 Oh. Oi.
Leopold Magnus 01:39:31 Nice, 22 to hit. 8 damage on the rock. Oh my, oh my, this is not something I'm cut out for.
Dungeon Master 01:39:33 22 hits. Fling it, it hits her directly in the center of the forehead. You see she head goes back, jilts, and she stops moving, and then just falls backwards with a thud of the sand. She is out.
Leopold Magnus 01:40:00 Reminds me of the blood pits that Father got when Victor got promoted to captain.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:09 I'm just gonna start chanting grandpa. Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Yeah, I'm over there too.
Dungeon Master 01:40:25 people still aren't very stoked on them. So not a lot of people join you, but some people who placed a bet on him seem pretty stoked. He goes, yeah, I got your money right here. I got you. I put it through the party too. You have 448.
Kaladin Shash 01:40:25 Right. Immediately visit the bookie. Yeah, 250 that will grab it.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:49 All right, now I'll grab... There we go. All right.
Leopold Magnus 01:40:49 I'm going to lamp out like this.
Dungeon Master 01:40:54 So the split is 248 and 200. Your 50 got your 200 back.
Kaladin Shash 01:41:01 Right, here we go. Leopold, how do you feel?
Leopold Magnus 01:41:20 You can see his leg is dragging. And not acting this time.
Kaladin Shash 01:41:30 Don't don't this don't. Doesn't the armor have some sort of once a day heal to it or something in the future? Administers some sort of. Yeah. OK.
Dungeon Master 01:41:38 Uh, I mean out of gain it just sort of uh Has like a non there there mending cantrip Or like it just keeps it from getting like visually scuffed, but he if he's injured it's not going to repair him But are you talking about the your free potion you get it? Yeah, you've got one free, uh
Zariel Torgan 01:41:52 Well you're, well you're talking about the legionaries, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:42:03 Oh, that's right. Well, there's more people.
Dungeon Master 01:42:08 healing out of it. And I'm not quite sure, but it's one of those.
Kaladin Shash 01:42:11 Yeah, we're not going to be able to just kind of above table. We're really not going to be able to put on much of a fight if now we've got to face Cedric and Leopold has to do it again.
Leopold Magnus 01:42:32 You know, if it's 3v1 or whatever, it will be fun. But yeah, I don't think I'd take another one-on-one.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:44 I'm still pretty, uh, I'm still pretty solid. I mean, I'm not good in a fight because my AC's dogshit, but, I mean, as far as, like, having it. Mhm.
Kaladin Shash 01:42:52 Okay. Yeah. Oh, like just able to pump more into him during the fight. Yeah. I'm actually pretty good on spells. I must use my, cause I saw both twos. I must've used my, uh, arcane recovery ability to get my second spot. Everything I've got can be really noticeable.
Leopold Magnus 01:43:18 Jonathan, what was that? Was it just basically a free health potion per day, like a regular health potion? OK, I'm going to take that. 2D4 plus 2. Wow, solidly bad. I'll recover 4 health.
Dungeon Master 01:43:25 Yeah. 24 plus two. You can't just self-administer.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:37 Oh my god. Can I give him mine? Can I just plug my suit into his suit? That's rough.
Kaladin Shash 01:43:38 Yeah. Talk to the bookie. How does this next part work? We said they're quite. Can we have more than one
Dungeon Master 01:44:05 And the bookie explains that you can go ask, but it's ultimately up to him. And you guys find out at this point, which you hadn't clarified earlier, the only person who can challenge is somebody who fought. So the only one who can fight again is Leopold.
Kaladin Shash 01:44:21 Excellent. Oh. Like we need to fight to be able to fight Cedric together. I will fight. I will fight. Good.
Dungeon Master 01:44:32 Yeah, there were three people to fight, and one of you went and fought. So one of you advances.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:41 Above table, I probably have the best, because I can wild shape and get like an extra 30 hit points. We don't have to do that, but I like that. Oh, I see what you're saying. Gotcha. Gotcha. No, go for it.
Kaladin Shash 01:44:54 Yeah. Well, I mean, if we all want to, if we all want to fight Cedric, I think we're all going to fight. I would have, I would have. OK, there you go.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:01 Yeah, it's where we all have to go one on one.
Dungeon Master 01:45:09 It was already round 6, the in-between times left a little faded.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:15 Yeah, hey, stay out and you can keep Bless Up if we go quick enough. You don't have to burn the spell slot again. Okay. Alright. Well then, yeah, I'll... Let me see how I want to play this.
Kaladin Shash 01:45:24 Yeah, I'll just burn it again. I've got plenty of ones. I can do another one.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:50 Okay. Yeah, I'm good. I'll step forward. I gotta go over here. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:46:01 OK. Your name was Tuberculosis Jim. OK. Let's see what else I got. OK. You step forward. The announcer screams out.
Kaladin Shash 01:46:09 We.
Dungeon Master 01:46:27 Tuberculosis Jim and the crowd looks very confused. Nobody gets it. If you guys like to. Well, not yet, but it depends on who he gets paired with, and then the odds are determined by that.
Leopold Magnus 01:46:36 Jonathan, what if we had a chance to bet on him with the bookie? Got it.
Kaladin Shash 01:46:41 Oh, yes. Yeah, I would like to put. Right. All right, here we go.
Dungeon Master 01:46:59 When you step up, you see this other guy that had stopped Kaladin stands back up. And then also that nobody had noticed before. Somebody who is sitting and watching the whole time stands up in the corner and goes, Oh, I have a fight at him as well. And he is over here.
Kaladin Shash 01:47:30 What do you say? Have a fight?
Dungeon Master 01:47:33 Yeah, he'll jump into the contending also. So Zaryl will have his pick between, we'll say guy A and guy B, because you don't know their names. One guy looks like he's got like a padded leather shirt on, but like an everyday shirt. And the guy who's standing at the arena already is shirtless. He's like,
Zariel Torgan 01:47:46 Does one guy seem like he's wearing armor versus natural armor? Does the other guy look like he has a weapon that he's brandishing for us to use?
Dungeon Master 01:48:02 He's got his pants on, his loose slacks tied up with just a belt, and he's got leather wrappings around his fists. Give me a perception check. You don't see anything.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:18 Well, she stood and shook hers. Is he just being coy? I mean, I'm rolling it, but got 19. Hmm. The little icon, he's he's holding a knife. Is that is that just the icon? OK.
Dungeon Master 01:48:32 No, you see, you don't see it, but at his waist, he has like a sheet style belt. Like it definitely, you can see something straps at the side, but it's sort of covered. It's not out in the open. Everybody starts remembering.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:49 I'll fight that guy. The one over there, away from the pit. Kind of by the table. Over there. Well, don't do that now. Do that before.
Dungeon Master 01:49:05 He walks up, chops down, hits the ground. You hear a nice solid thud just as the sand displaces. Everybody's going, that's him. That's the guy. We haven't seen him so long. And it's just sort of all the murmuring. And the announcer goes, in an unexpected showing, we have Rurik the Iron Fist. And everybody starts cheering.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:32 Can I, well I just wrote, nevermind, I just rolled a perception check on him. I was trying to see if I could see one of those hands on him, but that's okay. Yeah, so do we just keep the same perception checks? I mean, initiatives, because I like mine. Damn it, all right. It's a good call. Hey, 17.
Dungeon Master 01:49:50 No, we do new ones. Yeah, sorry, bud. Do you step in the fighting? As a person.
Zariel Torgan 01:50:01 I jump down, and I land, and I start pawing and scratching the ground with my bare hands. As a person, yeah. Still getting the timing down on this shape-shifting thing.
Dungeon Master 01:50:18 Do you guys want to be involved in this or do you guys want to wait? But do you want to be a part of the initiative order or not? Cool. Are you trying to hide it?
Kaladin Shash 01:50:25 in what oh yeah i'll be part of this and then gonna as he entered could i have cast blessed on all three of us again i'm trying to be discreet yeah
Leopold Magnus 01:50:32 Yeah, sure. Why not?
Dungeon Master 01:50:45 Go ahead and give me a slight of hand or deception check, something like that. All right. That is some amount of effective. You're not entirely sure.
Kaladin Shash 01:50:56 13, not bad. It's a really crowded bar.
Dungeon Master 01:51:13 Uh, perfect. Okay, uh, first up, Zariel with the 17. You were first to act. Uh, two to one if you want to bet.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:22 All right, let's see.
Kaladin Shash 01:51:31 Oh, hey, Jonathan, what were the odds on this one? Could we have put coin down? You're on a bet. I'll put $100 on it.
Leopold Magnus 01:51:39 Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm also going to bet I'll put, uh, I'll put 85 on it. I'll, uh, start shaking my arm again, watching gold coins fling out and say, my man's Zario never ceases to amaze. And then additionally with magical tinkering, uh, is there any ashtrays in the building?
Leopold Magnus 01:52:06 Like maybe over here, like a little candlestick or something. Yeah, I'm gonna grab an ashtray, kind of push my way through and say, do you boys mind if I borrow this for a second? And snag your ashtray. And I'm gonna do some magical tinkering and I'm gonna kind of fix a little gemstone in this. I'm gonna turn it upside down
Dungeon Master 01:52:09 Yeah. You definitely go up to somebody's table and take it, but you could do that. One of them goes, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:52:36 give it four little legs. So it crawls around like looking like a spider and a couple of arms. And it says I can imbue it with visual effect, including up to 25 words. So with the little gem on its back, it's just going to kind of shoot up a projection that says, Go, Zario. And it's going to kind of tinker about the edge of the edge of the fighting pit back and forth and turn them on.
Kaladin Shash 01:52:56 It's Jim. His name is Jim. Tuberculosis Jim.
Leopold Magnus 01:53:08 Little Jim. Oh, oh, yes, of course. And it'll just switch really fast, hopefully, before anybody sees it. It says, go Jim. It says, big Jim, go Jim. It flashes between those two.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:08 Yeah, it's still my turn. I haven't done anything yet, right?
Dungeon Master 01:53:19 Redo it, do the whole thing over again. Sorry, it was your turn still. So did you want to do something? Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:41 Okay, I'm gonna use this time to use one of my two wild shapes, cuz we've short rested, right? Okay, I'm gonna wild shape, I'm gonna start sprinting towards this guy. And about halfway down, I'm gonna turn into my dire wolf form.
Kaladin Shash 01:53:50 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:06 And my direwolf is going to leap forward and do a... Let's see. A bite attack. And let's see. I thought I had this thing where if I run... Oh, it's just if I hit. Okay, never mind. I'm gonna roll to hit. Bad. 14.
Kaladin Shash 01:54:36 Bless. Bless. Good dog.
Dungeon Master 01:54:36 My 14 misses. Oh, you are blessed. 19 hits. 9 damage, nicely done.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:38 Oh, bless. Eighteen. Nice. That's gonna be nine piercing damage. I start biting right on their shoulders.
Dungeon Master 01:55:08 Anything else? Okay, Kaladin. As this is happening, you have a chance to do something real quick. What would you like to do? You see that Azariel sort of...
Zariel Torgan 01:55:12 That's everything I got. Oh yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:55:19 I want to watch Cedric. Do I see him doing anything? Do I see him gesturing or his eyes changing colors?
Dungeon Master 01:55:32 transforms, does something more that wasn't announced at the beginning of the fight. He leans forward and he's about to do something, but it's not his turn yet. You guys sure love to cheat. I don't think you did. Yeah, that's just weird furry stuff, you know.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:46 Hey, I pawed and scratched. I let him know what I was doing. I made wolf sounds. Yeah, I did. I said I jumped into the pit and I started clawing and scratching and howling in my human form. Yeah, I thought Sedgwick would be into it.
Kaladin Shash 01:56:01 Can I do another perception check to see if I notice anyone else? That's fine. All right, that's my turn right now. I'm just watching.
Dungeon Master 01:56:08 I'm going to say no, we've made a lot of checks and none have been successful. Okay, up next is this guy. He with a giant wolf now in his face is going to go bloody fucking hell. He will make two attacks at you.
Dungeon Master 01:56:38 Uh, he is gonna go for an uppercut on his first attack. Uh, gotta pull this out differently. Oh, it doesn't have... I have to learn manually. It doesn't have like an actual box to do. That's weird.
Dungeon Master 01:57:10 11 to hit. I'd say that's not good. Second attack, you see, very slyly, when he does it, nobody notices it, but he pretends like he's going to hit you just in the face, and with his other hand, he crosses over his abdomen, and he goes to cut you, trying to conceal it, already sort of cheating. This'll be his bladed attack.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:13 11 does not hit.
Dungeon Master 01:57:43 A dirty 20 to hit. And that'll be a d8 plus 3. You take 5 points of slashing damage. And that is his turn. Leopold, your turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:45 that does hit.
Leopold Magnus 01:58:08 Uh, okay. Yep. I'm just going to scream out, go DB Jim, go get them. And, uh, the crab will kind of circulate over to the other side of the arena here. And you'll just see the sign flash back and forth. Big Jim, big Jim. Uh, and then with one last final.
Dungeon Master 01:58:29 People are kind of getting into it.
Zariel Torgan 01:58:29 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:58:37 just to translate that to Zariel's and his wolf form. That would be my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:58:47 At the start of Initiative, you see Kaladin, because you're watching, Cedric seems to be, he's got his hand in his palm, watching, but somewhat bored, and he sort of makes a motion, his eyes flash gold again, and a similar golden aura pops up around this guy, the Iron Fist, as he was called.
Kaladin Shash 01:59:11 Okay. It's all over.
Zariel Torgan 01:59:18 Counterspell. What? I can't counterspell. Is it really my turn, though? When I attacked, he needed to have rolled a Strength saving throw, or be knocked prone.
Dungeon Master 01:59:24 Uh, sorry, it was your turn. Are you counter spelling? Just kidding. Go ahead. Yeah, I know. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:59:51 He rolled a 14. So he didn't have Bless at that point. All right. That's what it was right there.
Zariel Torgan 01:59:56 Okay, yeah, he succeeded. I'm gonna make another attack. Okay. I'm gonna release off the neck, having been sliced across the wolf chest. I'm gonna look down, and I'm gonna lick a little bit of the blood that's coming off, and sling my tongue around so it's all over my face, and then I'm gonna try to bite him again. This time I'm just gonna go right for his gut.
Zariel Torgan 02:00:25 It's aaaargh. Uh, bad. Hmm, not good. Hmm. Yeah, that hits.
Dungeon Master 02:00:35 misses. He will use his reaction to retaliate. He makes an additional attack when somebody misses him. That'll be a 22 to hit. It'll be, uh, it's just a normal fist attack, so it's a d4 plus 3, but give me a cough to saving throw.
Zariel Torgan 02:01:06 Wolf Kahn. Six. Oof. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:01:11 You take only 4 points of blood pain damage with that. You are stunned until the end of your next turn. You took 4 points of damage though, so not a lot. That ends your turn. It is now Kaladin. Oh, that was a constitution save. You got a 6. Roll your Bless, because you might pass if you get the 4.
Zariel Torgan 02:01:42 Uh, okay. Ooh. Oh, also, um... My wolf form has pluses to saving throws for two of them, but not for the rest of them. Is that normal? Okay, alright. Dammit. Alright, continue.
Dungeon Master 02:01:47 Okay, now. Close, though. Gotta remember that bless. Mhm. Yes. You're only proficient in certain saving throws, you know. Uh, Kaladin's turn.
Kaladin Shash 02:02:12 Yeah, I'm just gonna keep. Keep keeping an eye on Cedric and keep watching the fight. My second another time. Right, I need to. OK, but he has. He cast bless a second time in this fight now.
Dungeon Master 02:02:19 You gather that he, in fact, cast Bless again. Yes, when he saw Zariel transform, he cast Bless on his contender, the Iron Fist, to sort of even the match back up. No, just the ones.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:19 This is gone.
Kaladin Shash 02:02:44 Okay, awesome. You're just confirming I saw what I saw. I gotcha. Okay. Yeah. That's all I'm doing.
Dungeon Master 02:02:47 Yeah, because you said you're just watching him. That's all that's happened. The iron fist turn. With you stunned, he's going to make his two attacks with advantage. He went for the uppercut recharge, but it failed with only a one. So he's going to just do another studded fist and then he'll try to sneak in a bladed fist attack.
Dungeon Master 02:03:20 First one is a 19 to hit. Give me another Constitution save. And the second one... ...passes. Having to roll these myself is annoying because I can't just do it with advantage. Second one misses, I believe.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:24 Yep, hits. 16.
Dungeon Master 02:03:48 That was a 9 and a 6 to hit with a D4 that hit on either of them. OK. That is his turn then. Leopold, you are up.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:55 No.
Leopold Magnus 02:04:07 Go get them, Jim. Go get them. And I think at this time, I've gone maybe to the bar paid for drink. I'm just sloshing a big stein kind of all over. Beer is flying out with making a big nest
Dungeon Master 02:04:21 You see all these just sitting there looking at you bewilder and just, you're a weird man, you know. You guys never really told me why you were here anyway. You just sort of walked in and asked about that specific guy. Yeah, that guy.
Zariel Torgan 02:04:38 Let's check.
Leopold Magnus 02:04:38 Oh, that guy. And I start pointing again. Oh, yes. He just seems like quite the fellow worth talking to, I suppose. Oh, with less. Oh, no. Got it. 14.
Dungeon Master 02:04:53 Give me a deception check. He goes, right, OK. Here's your beer.
Kaladin Shash 02:05:01 Nope.
Leopold Magnus 02:05:17 Thank you very much, sir. I go back to the pits, my new refreshment, and that's my turn.
Dungeon Master 02:05:33 Okay, up at the top, Zariel, your turn. You are stunned. And then your turn ends, and it's now Kaladin's turn. Zariel, in your wolf form, you feel rocked with that. He hits you so hard and like, the nose, that you just could not act normally.
Kaladin Shash 02:05:45 You should do something. Why didn't you do anything?
Zariel Torgan 02:06:06 None of what you said made it Said on a deep he said you're gonna roll a d5 and then you're like with a six he does
Dungeon Master 02:06:06 Kaladin, end of your turn, it'll be this guy's turn again. We'll roll a d5 to see if his Uppercut recharges. On a six it does. He grabs your wolf head in his hands. What do you mean? Did I not see it? Oh, sorry.
Dungeon Master 02:06:36 It might have cut out. D6 on a 5 or a 6 it recharges. On the 6 it does. So he grabs your enormous direwolf head in his hands and then one hand low rocks you at the bottom of the jaw. It still has to roll to hit though. D20 plus 5. 16 to hit.
Zariel Torgan 02:06:37 Okay. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:07:08 That's 2d10 plus 3 damage and give me another constitution save. Nice. You take 12 points of damage. I just need to change this to roll to everybody.
Zariel Torgan 02:07:19 uh... dirty twenty
Dungeon Master 02:07:38 Okay. Uh, second attack. He's going to try to stun you again. That's just his one of his attacks. Uh, maybe with less, he hits 12. Okay. That's the end of his turn. Leopold, your go.
Zariel Torgan 02:07:57 No.
Leopold Magnus 02:08:05 Ah, man, I cannot do much to help him out. I just don't have anything I could do. I'll kind of move back over here, getting closer to the ring, and I'll say, get him, Jimmy! Get him!
Dungeon Master 02:08:09 And you don't have to do anything if you don't want to. OK. Zario, up again, not stunned.
Kaladin Shash 02:08:24 We got to talk about it. I mean, not talk about it. I thought we were trying to talk to him. We're going to be spent by the time I fight too, and we get to fight him.
Zariel Torgan 02:08:32 I'm seriously considering jumping out of this ring and just trying to kill that dude. But... We haven't talked about it as a group, but... That was my thought, is we're burning all of these resources and we could just go fuck this guy up. But...
Dungeon Master 02:08:40 Whatever you do is up to you.
Kaladin Shash 02:08:56 and hope we talk to him. Well, that's fine. I'll follow your lead.
Zariel Torgan 02:08:58 Well, I don't think we need to talk to him. He's got the hand, which means we know he's at least connected to this thing. And so, unless he's so powerful that he can kill us, I mean, that would suck. But, you know, we don't have to murk him. It's okay, it's okay. We didn't talk about it ahead of time. And, uh, Zariel wouldn't put everybody at risk like that. So, I'm just gonna make another attack. Ow. Munch.
Zariel Torgan 02:09:28 Jesus 12. Oh I get less. 13. Alright.
Dungeon Master 02:09:31 Doesn't hit. He might hit with left. 13 misses. Okay, Kaladin, anything you want to do? We're just moving on to the Iron Fist.
Kaladin Shash 02:09:31 You're blessed. You're blessed. Just move on.
Dungeon Master 02:10:04 Let's change this up a bit. This is getting a little more tense. How many times have you heard this, Jesse? He's going to just a couple, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:10:24 At least a couple.
Dungeon Master 02:10:30 Uh, he's gonna start with trying to stun you on his first attack. Oh, well, he'll roll to see if he gets his uppercut again. Uh, one does not, so he'll just make his normal attack. A dirty 20 to hit.
Zariel Torgan 02:10:57 Oh yeah. 14.
Dungeon Master 02:10:59 Okay, give me that DC 10 con save. 14 passes, you take five points of bludgeoning damage, and then on his second attack, he will try to stab you with his blade.
Dungeon Master 02:11:30 17 to hit. And that'll be at d8 plus 3. You take 5 more points of damage. And that ends his turn. Leopold, your turn to skip. Cool.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:32 It's.
Leopold Magnus 02:11:55 Kip, for me, not really doing anything besides cheering.
Dungeon Master 02:12:01 Zario. Your turn.
Kaladin Shash 02:12:01 you.
Zariel Torgan 02:12:15 Oh, I didn't hear you say that. Yeah, so in the feat for my direwolf, it says I have pack tactics if I have an ally within five feet that isn't incapacitated. Now,
Dungeon Master 02:12:39 Mm-hmm. Yeah, but then you wouldn't be in range of this guy. Yes, in theory. He'll take an attack of opportunity at you.
Zariel Torgan 02:12:42 Does that mean if I went over and stood at the edge here by Kaladin that I would have pack tactics? I know. Alright. I'm gonna back up over here and I'm gonna hold my action.
Kaladin Shash 02:12:48 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:13:13 Uh, hits with Taz attack. Give me another Khan save. You take five more damage. He's just chipping away. Uh, and you're good on that. Okay. Uh, you stand over there. Okay. Kaladin, your turn to skip.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:30 I am holding my action. I move away.
Kaladin Shash 02:13:45 I'll stay right there. We'll skip.
Dungeon Master 02:13:46 A great move. Okay. Uh, this guy's turn. Uh, we'll see if he's smart enough to know anything happens. Maybe he plays a smart. No, he doesn't. Uh, he dashes in. Uh, I imagine you're going to try to attack him as soon as he gets into range. Go for it.
Zariel Torgan 02:14:09 Yes. All right. 19. Ouch. Five damage. And I'm going to need a strength saving throw.
Dungeon Master 02:14:21 19 hits. Ooh, 11 plus a d4 for plus. There's a 14 save. Nice. That plus is so nice.
Zariel Torgan 02:14:45 Yes.
Kaladin Shash 02:14:47 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:14:53 Okay, that's your launched attack. You launch at him and he sort of realizes what he did at that moment, so he'll round back to be to the side and try to hit you. First thing he does is he throws a side hook into your ribcage as a giant wolf. Well, just kidding. At first he's going to see if he gets an uppercut. Yes, he does.
Dungeon Master 02:15:26 That is 17 plus blessed to hit. Okay, so you take, give me another constitution save. 18 passes. You take 13 damage.
Zariel Torgan 02:15:31 It hits, yeah. 18. It had one hit point.
Dungeon Master 02:15:56 Are you out of your, how much hit points does your wolf farm have? Okay, a second attack, he expects to hit the wolf in the face. Almost connects with your face, we'll see if he hits. 11 plus D4. 12 to hit.
Zariel Torgan 02:16:23 No. I am going to go back into my wolf form.
Dungeon Master 02:16:24 Okay, misses on his attack. He goes to hit too high, aiming for like the snout of the wolf and just goes right over your head as you shrink down to normal size. It is Leopold's turn unless he wishes to skip, and then it's your turn. Okay, there are...
Leopold Magnus 02:16:42 Sorry, nothing from me except continued moral support.
Zariel Torgan 02:16:55 And I think that's it. I don't think I have any bonus actions that I can do. Yeah, that's it.
Dungeon Master 02:17:17 Hey. Calden, on your turn, give me a perception check. 22. You see that Cedric seems to take notice that this happened another time. You don't have context for like why that would be?
Kaladin Shash 02:17:24 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:17:46 Interesting, but you do notice that when he goes back into a wolf form, he sort of shifts forward in his chair. Okay, it's this guy's turn again. Irritated that you just keep turning back.
Kaladin Shash 02:17:54 Okay. I'm not going to do anything else on my turn.
Dungeon Master 02:18:16 I think understandably. Doesn't get his uppercut. First strike, trying to go for that stun. Misses, second strike. 17 to hit.
Zariel Torgan 02:18:45 Pits. All right. I think I can make it no matter what. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:18:46 Go ahead and give me a con save. Roll load. Yeah, with Bless you make it no matter what. You're safe, but you take six points of damage from it.
Dungeon Master 02:19:16 And then it is Leopold's turn, unless he wants to skip, in which case it is you. So hurry up. Yep. 16 hits.
Zariel Torgan 02:19:17 All right. All right. I'm still within five feet. So I am going to attack. I'm going to bite. Chomp. 13 plus 16 to hit.
Leopold Magnus 02:19:24 Yep, Cesario.
Zariel Torgan 02:19:45 Ayyy, alright, now we're cookin'. And that's better. And then I'll need a strength-saving throw. Although it really doesn't matter in this way that combat's laid out, because he can just get up. But it's still for fun. Natural 20.
Dungeon Master 02:19:51 Alright. Natural 20. Waste of a nat 20. That's fine. Burn it while you can, I guess. Anything else on your turn? Is that it? Just gnawing, okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:20:15 I'm just gnawing on his leg. I'm just gonna... Yeah, I'm gonna gnaw on him. I'm gonna try to put my tongue in his ear in an uncomfortable way. Yeah. This is just a fursuit. It's not even a wolf. Not even a wolf. That's the real shocker. That's the real reveal of this whole campaign. It's just me in a suit.
Kaladin Shash 02:20:24 I'm sorry.
Dungeon Master 02:20:24 I'm going to say no, I don't want to deal with that. Tonguing my bosses. Oh no, that's ominous. Okay, unless you want to do something, it'll be this guy's turn again.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:39 It's fucking hilarious. I got a video for you after the session
Zariel Torgan 02:20:45 That sounds good. Alright.
Kaladin Shash 02:20:54 No, I'm just going to keep watching. Does the does the does the iron fist whatever baddie boy? Does he look like he's hurt? Is he taking some damage? Alright, cool. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:20:57 Okay. He's pretty hurt. He doesn't have multiple forms, but he's not getting hit a whole lot because he's just built around making sure the other person doesn't do anything. Speaking of which, on his turn, first and foremost,
Dungeon Master 02:21:26 Does he get his thing? No, he doesn't. So he'll waste his first attack trying to stun you. That for sure hits. Go ahead and give me a con save. 15 passes. You take seven points of damage from that though. He'll try to stab you next.
Zariel Torgan 02:21:41 Fifteen. No. But no matter what you roll, it'll hit. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:21:56 That's 13. Does 13 hit? Okay, D4 then. 14 is AC then? Okay, yeah. So he hits with that. And you take, ooh, he rolled an 8 on that. 11 points of damage. And that is the end of his turn. It is your turn again.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:19 Alright. I'm gonna reach down and try to bite right on his nuts. 22. Just gonna try to pop those things. Another 13 damage.
Dungeon Master 02:22:25 At this point, you guys just chime in if you want to do something and you didn't already use your turn. Otherwise, we'll streamline it and just go back and forth between fighters. 22 to hit. That hits.
Kaladin Shash 02:22:33 Way, way better.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:49 One of them pops.
Leopold Magnus 02:22:53 I think he got his left nut.
Dungeon Master 02:22:56 He might have got his left nut. He goes, fuck! And then he's going to instantly try to hit you after doing that. Let's see if it's an uppercut, though. Nope. Can't get that at all. And that's OK. He might hit with a d4. Yes, he does. Give me a con save.
Kaladin Shash 02:23:05 Cheese.
Zariel Torgan 02:23:24 Ouch. 13.
Dungeon Master 02:23:31 13 passes. You take 5 points of damage from the first one. And he stabs you. He's being less covert about it now, he's just like actively stabbing you. And you take... 10 points of damage on that one.
Zariel Torgan 02:23:54 All right, I'm out of my form again. Really can't use that. Let's see.
Kaladin Shash 02:23:57 I mean, he is rolling hot. You say your wolf form dropped? Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:24:00 You guys are looking about the same. Battle to the wire. Sariel, your turn.
Zariel Torgan 02:24:24 Yeah. All right. Or is that a bonus action? I would think so.
Kaladin Shash 02:24:29 Your armor does have one recharge. What's that? It's a bonus action. You're at 17. You should be able to make it at least another round. If we have to do that.
Zariel Torgan 02:24:50 Alright. Action, I'm going to... Let's see. So, I don't think Ice Knife is at disadvantage if it's up and close and personal.
Dungeon Master 02:25:15 Is it a ranged spell attack? Interesting. Hold on, let me Google it first.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:18 It says that, but the range, instead of being like 10 to whatever, it's 5 to whatever. But, you know what? Yeah, but you know what? I'll back up a little bit. I'll risk getting hit.
Kaladin Shash 02:25:27 I think it's assuming you could stab with a knife or throw it.
Dungeon Master 02:25:48 uh the five feet of it is uh when it explodes so like ice knife whether or not it hits or misses has a five foot aoe thing i think that's what it's referring to okay or he'll take reaction to try to hit you
Zariel Torgan 02:26:03 Oh, okay. Alright, well then I'll move. I'll risk getting whacked. Just gonna go right over here. Yeah, it'll hit. Yeah, it hits, yeah. Ouch.
Dungeon Master 02:26:16 uh 14 misses but with a d4 it might hit 16 to hit give me a con save you take four points of damage uh and you are stunned so you don't actually go anywhere
Kaladin Shash 02:26:32 Go to your D4. Almost. I'm almost. God, dude.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:37 Oh, stunned. I'm in trouble. Yeah. Well, since it was a bonus action to use that thing anyway, can I say before I moved, I used that potion? It says 2d4 plus 2.
Dungeon Master 02:26:43 You turn your head and you stop dead in your tracks. Yeah. I back OK.
Zariel Torgan 02:27:07 That's five.
Kaladin Shash 02:27:11 So you're at 22, man.
Dungeon Master 02:27:17 With you stunned, he's going to see if he gets his uppercut. Does not. But he does have advantage on these. It tells me how to roll it with advantage. 2d, 20, keep highest, 1. That's cool.
Dungeon Master 02:27:51 I think it's close. Oh, sweet, that worked. Hell yeah. Dirty 20 to hit. Give me that con save.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:07 Did it not click on it? Oh, here it is. Okay, there we go. 20. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:28:18 Oh, you're good on that. You take 6 points of damage, which you are not done. Second attack, he's going to try to stab you. He has advantage. 18 to hit. You take 4 points of damage.
Dungeon Master 02:28:52 You see with how you're doing and how sort of the tides have changed, and with you losing your Wolf Worm and not going back, you kind of know to pay out attention for it now, and so does Kaladin. You see that Cedric seems to sort of wave his hand sort of nonchalantly, and the magic seems to fade around the Iron Fist, and he seemingly loses his buff as well. But it is your turn after that.
Zariel Torgan 02:29:22 Well, I'm still stunned. So I was holding my action to move, but I got stunned. So do I just lose that action for that turn?
Dungeon Master 02:29:26 Yes, you are. This is turn again. Unless somebody else wants to go. At the end of your turn, you are no longer stunned. You bonus action healed and then you went to move, correct?
Kaladin Shash 02:29:34 That's what we do.
Zariel Torgan 02:29:53 Yeah. Because I was gonna... Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:29:55 yeah so you you lost that because that's yeah stunned it means you just can't do anything uh he's gonna he doesn't have advantage on this next one but he's gonna keep going for the same strat um 13 misses he does not have
Dungeon Master 02:30:24 Bless, so second attack instead. Missus, your turn. In this situation, I think this is more fun.
Zariel Torgan 02:30:35 All right, let's see here. I'm going to try the same thing. I'm going to try to run away.
Dungeon Master 02:31:02 OK, same deal. Before you move yourself, it's going to try to hit you. Natural 20. Go ahead and give me another con save.
Zariel Torgan 02:31:12 That's unfortunate. Jesus Christ. Yeah, that's it. Alright.
Kaladin Shash 02:31:24 Are you D4? Oh, right here.
Dungeon Master 02:31:31 You are stunned and you take 10 points of damage. Before he starts his turn, Kaladin, you see how this is playing out. Zariel went to turn again and he was caught with an unfortunate
Dungeon Master 02:31:57 hook right to the side of his face that he didn't see coming. And it rocks him so hard that you can tell that he is probably going to drop this next round. You were in between them in initiative. Would you like to do some? OK, less drops. That is round 11, you are correct.
Kaladin Shash 02:32:15 No, but this round there's no longer bless on my side either.
Dungeon Master 02:32:31 Okay, it is the iron fist turn. See if he gets his uppercut. He does not. He still has advantage though because you are stunned. Oh, 14 to hit. Okay, one more attack. He goes to stab you.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:55 That's a miss. Yeah, that hits.
Kaladin Shash 02:32:55 Me too. Oh, good.
Dungeon Master 02:33:04 That is a 21 to hit. With six points of damage, Zorro, you have the option of A, dropping unconscious, or B, you can try to stay up.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:32 Well, I think this is the closest he's been to dying since today, so I think he's going to try to stay up.
Kaladin Shash 02:33:41 Dig in.
Dungeon Master 02:33:42 I will. I agree. Do you see in this moment the crowd is cheering. It is like bloodlust. People are holding out their coins into the arena sort of cheering and chanting. This guy is you can get you get the vibe from him pretty quickly that he is.
Dungeon Master 02:34:00 like not a fair player like he is just holding a knife in his hand that wasn't established uh and he is like stabbing your abdomen over and over and you're bleeding almost profusely through your armor and you can tell that like he's not going for unconsciousness dude is is fighting to kill you right now um as you go to drop unconsciousness that you sort of reach down deep and you hear your heart start thumping in your ears again just that
Dungeon Master 02:34:31 And you pop up with 10 HP instead. And it is your turn.
Zariel Torgan 02:34:41 All right. There we go. With total disregard for how bad this tactic has worked all the other times, again, I am going to move to the corner.
Kaladin Shash 02:35:04 Yes. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:35:06 No way. Natural 20. Give me another constitution save. I would like that. 14 save. He does.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:19 Jesus Christ. Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you? 14. Ha! 16.
Dungeon Master 02:35:35 10 points of damage. Give me a constitution saving throw. You remain at 1 HP.
Kaladin Shash 02:35:46 P4. Oh, there we go. Good. Oh, you can have both.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:52 All right, 17.
Dungeon Master 02:35:52 You hear nothing. It is muted. The crowd is not making noise. All you hear in your head is the blood pumping, just filling, and it's like throbbing, and it's almost like ocean waves just washing over all of your senses. You just keep holding in there, but you do successfully get out of his range, stumbling, catching yourself. You stand up. You have made it away from him.
Zariel Torgan 02:36:20 Now what would be really funny is if this didn't land. Ice knife. Uh, 18. And that's gonna be... Uh, 9 piercing damage, and then he needs to make a deck-saving throw. Alright.
Dungeon Master 02:36:28 18 hits. He is proficient indexes. 17. I don't think so either.
Zariel Torgan 02:36:50 Uh, I think on a success, he doesn't take any damage. Uh, bonus action... Uh... Can I do healing word as a bonus action? Or can I not do two spells? Okay. Okay. Alright.
Dungeon Master 02:37:13 You can't do 2 spells, unless you quit getting stuck. Oh, your action was to cast Ice Knife, wasn't it? Okay. Same deal as before. Kaladin, you have an opportunity to act in between them.
Zariel Torgan 02:37:19 then I am holding my action. My bonus action. Yeah, I know, I'm just gonna hold on my bonus.
Dungeon Master 02:37:39 Azariel still looks very hurt, but he's holding in there surprisingly. Okay.
Kaladin Shash 02:37:46 They don't have any sort of aid to offer. They don't have. Well. How does? What are the mechanics of the charges on the spear for the slumber spores?
Kaladin Shash 02:38:16 Oh, he's way out of range. He's like way in front of him again. Yeah, that's worthwhile. That's okay. Yeah, no, I got nothing.
Dungeon Master 02:38:17 It would be like an attack. You wave it to do it, so it would be very obvious. Okay, he closes the distance with a full sprint. He goes to kangaroo kick you in the face with his fists, of course. Nine misses, correct. Second attack.
Zariel Torgan 02:38:36 I guess I could try to hit him. I don't really hit much.
Dungeon Master 02:38:48 Two, natural two misses, shout out. Your turn.
Kaladin Shash 02:38:50 Um, oh my gosh Just take him down you can't run away Yeah
Leopold Magnus 02:39:05 You should just try to run away again.
Zariel Torgan 02:39:08 I think I'm gonna... I'll try... I'll get a scimitar. I'll try my thorn whip. I'm gonna reach out and grab some thorn and try to slap him. Nope. Not quite what we needed.
Kaladin Shash 02:39:26 God dang it. Come on.
Dungeon Master 02:39:29 Misses. It's going to attack. We're just going to roll and see if he gets it. Uh, 30, 20 to hit. Give me that con save or be stunned. You're safe. Where's the last time I rolled up to a normality?
Zariel Torgan 02:39:44 Well, at this point, I don't think it matters. 15. 15.
Dungeon Master 02:39:54 Uh, you take four points of damage. Go ahead and give me that constitution saving throw again. Okay. You stay up at one HP. A second attack. Uh, yeah, he hasn't done more than one, right?
Kaladin Shash 02:40:07 Yes.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:19 No, not yet. Fifth. 22. 11 plus. Oh, OK.
Dungeon Master 02:40:23 That is 18 to hit. Give me that con save. Give me another one so you don't go unconscious. And you don't get stunned.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:51 Oh, I don't have that. Never mind. Forget about that D4. That was wrong. Alright. What can I do? Really do anything? The whip wasn't great. And plus it only does a D6. Um, let's see.
Dungeon Master 02:40:53 No. Uh, you still passed. Eleven passed. Uh, his turn is over. It is your turn. What can you do?
Kaladin Shash 02:41:02 Oh my goodness, what are you going to do?
Zariel Torgan 02:41:27 I'm going to use my bonus action and I'm going to cast Flame Blade. And it allows me to use my action to make a melee spell attack. Roll that here. 17.
Dungeon Master 02:41:34 OK. Mhm. Yes, it does. Hits. Oh my gosh.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:56 That's gonna be 10 fire damage from the Flame Blade. That's action and bonus.
Kaladin Shash 02:41:59 Yeah. Put him on the ground. Oh, so the last three rounds is crazy.
Leopold Magnus 02:42:04 They needed that, man.
Dungeon Master 02:42:06 the battle of 1HP. Anything else on your turn?
Dungeon Master 02:42:20 Okay, on his turn, he's looking at you guys, your eyes are closing shut. You just torched his whole front, so his vest and his padded armor is ashen and peeling off, and he's got a huge gash across his chest. He's loosely holding onto his knife, and he's wobbling a little bit, but he comes at you once more, knowing this is probably it for one of you. 11 misses.
Kaladin Shash 02:42:43 Oh. He won't go down. Oh yeah, you fucking kidding me.
Dungeon Master 02:42:53 He hits with an 18. I'm not going to roll damage because no matter what, he's either going to knock you down or you're going to stay up with your con saves. 22. You stay conscious. Give me a con save to see if you get stunned. Six. You fail. You are stunned.
Zariel Torgan 02:43:02 So that's a 22. Done.
Dungeon Master 02:43:17 Uh, his first attack had missed, right? Second hit. Okay, so you're just done, but that means it goes back to his turn, so he gets to attack again, this time with advantage. At this point, it's just a battle of the saves. Uh, 22 to hit. Give me a con save to see if you go out. Fix. You guys see, it is like...
Zariel Torgan 02:43:39 Six.
Dungeon Master 02:43:45 a movie scene exchange of blows. They are just stab, slash, punch, hit, duck, shove, you know, like absolutely brawling it out. Zariel goes down, stands up, goes down, stands up, his head hits the wall, he straightens back out. But with one final hit, this guy takes a fist to the bottom of his chin with an unseen uppercut, and Zariel hits the wall unconscious and slides to his butt in the corner.
Dungeon Master 02:44:21 At first, the crowd is silent before everybody erupts into cheers with the fight that had just happened. What would you guys like to do? He's just unconscious.
Kaladin Shash 02:44:34 I'll go collect him. Start dragging him out of the ring.
Zariel Torgan 02:44:41 Uh uh uh uh.
Leopold Magnus 02:44:41 He's just unconscious, so you said this guy was killing him, right? Oh, okay. Why was that ability he had to stun in every attack? That's crazy.
Dungeon Master 02:44:55 uh he is let me open up this thing he is a bandit pugilist i had nicknamed him cheater uh because uh you guys didn't attack him with unarmed attack so his boxer's guard didn't come into play but when he makes
Dungeon Master 02:45:13 His turn he makes two melee weapon attacks. One of them, they're each from like a list of three. He has a studded fist, and a bladed fist, and then an uppercut that he can recharge. His studded fist, anytime he hits, they have to make a DC 10 constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of their next turn.
Leopold Magnus 02:45:34 Damn, that's like 10x better than a monk. That's wild. I should have played that guy. What the fuck? That's insane.
Dungeon Master 02:45:38 Yeah. Uh, well, it's not a class. It's just, I'm just a bandit. Uh, and then the uppercut was 2d10 damage, which is insane. And then it's a DC 15 con save or be stunned and prone. So that one was pretty nuts. No, uh,
Kaladin Shash 02:45:52 Oh my gosh.
Zariel Torgan 02:45:54 Jesus.
Dungeon Master 02:46:01 Every single one of, well, I'm not going to ruin all of them, but the fights were designed to be hard to sort of push you to, um, into using stress points because they have like a canonical importance and stuff. Uh, so like all the opportunities you have to turn it down or accept it as like matters. Uh, but Leopold, you fucking crushed your fight. Still did it.
Leopold Magnus 02:46:24 Barely, with a lot of help. Managed to squeak by.
Dungeon Master 02:46:29 They're each at least the same DC or above. Good fight though. How does Zariel feel? You were unconscious. Yeah, a DC 10 medicine check to stabilize.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:44 Well, have I been raised or I'm still unconscious? Natural 20.
Kaladin Shash 02:46:50 Well, I can stabilize, can I stabilize him? Can I, I don't have like a, can I do a medical check on him to heal him with? Nope. Yep. Didn't stabilize him. I'll do it again. Takes care of himself.
Dungeon Master 02:47:00 Go ahead and give me a death save, while in the meantime, just for the fun of it. Now at 20, you pop up with 1 HP. You kick to your feet, and I can say, hold on, hold on, hold on. You would have made that death save at the start of your very next turn. Would you like to finish him instead if you had an attack?
Kaladin Shash 02:47:25 Yes, yes.
Zariel Torgan 02:47:27 I would like to.
Dungeon Master 02:47:27 You would have gotten to take your turn the next round. So you pop up, the crowd erupts into cheers. They're all exchanging bets, the bookie's handing out money, and then you hear a... As the sand sprays out, and you see Zariel kicked to his feet with lightning speed. Kaladin, give me a perception check. Zariel, make your attack.
Kaladin Shash 02:47:55 I see nothing. Gosh, man. There's just not. It's meant to be is exactly how it was supposed to be. Yeah, that's terrible.
Leopold Magnus 02:47:55 Oh, come on. Let's see it. Jesus Christ. Brutal. Three. Jesus.
Zariel Torgan 02:48:01 And.
Dungeon Master 02:48:06 No, just make it with advantage. This needs to have importance. Come on. Well, no. Okay, so he's going to roll his hit. Go ahead and prep your con save. You still have a chance. A 15 hit. Roll your con save.
Kaladin Shash 02:48:30 Nope. That's a miss. Wait, 15 doesn't hit though, does it? Oh, it's your AC. Oh, I guess your wolf was higher than that. OK. Come on.
Zariel Torgan 02:48:30 Oh. Oh, 17. 15 does hit. 15.
Dungeon Master 02:48:36 17 you save so Yeah, it does it which is why you made the con save I just knew that it was gonna do so it's now your turn again though You're not gonna try to hit with like a scimitar. So you have your flame blade Concentration don't you have a normal sword?
Leopold Magnus 02:48:55 Yeah, that flame blade, use that thing. Jesus Christ. Come on, let me see something greater than a 10.
Zariel Torgan 02:48:56 Nah, the flame blade went down when I died. I lost concentration. Yeah. Yeah, but it's plus four to hit. I'm not a fighter. Flame blade's, uh, well, thorn whip's the best I got. Oh my Jesus. Ugh.
Dungeon Master 02:49:08 Oh, it's not as good. He misses on his attack.
Kaladin Shash 02:49:20 It's just, it's like, terrible. They're just so exhausted. This is like, this is like, this is so, yes! God, just take him out. That's it.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:31 You guys are just watching me just like slap him. 24. Five.
Dungeon Master 02:49:37 Misses again. It is your turn. That was almost on that 20. Nice. Roll your damage, sir. Five damage. Zariel, how do you finish him?
Leopold Magnus 02:49:40 Hey! Now whip him! Whip him!
Kaladin Shash 02:49:49 That's it. He's gotta be on the ground.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:56 I keep getting punched, and I keep getting knocked out, and then I hit the ground, and it wakes me up, so I stand up, and then I get knocked out, and I've got a lot of CTE.
Dungeon Master 02:50:06 Uh, yeah
Zariel Torgan 02:50:12 I'm gonna donate my brain for science. I reach down, one of these times I'm on the ground, right when everybody thinks I'm out, and instead of throwing myself back up into his fist, like I've done the last three times, this time, I put my hand in the ground, all the way to the elbow in the earth, and then I yank on a thorny whip.
Zariel Torgan 02:50:38 pulling it out of the ground while I'm still sitting, that way he can't punch me in the face again, and then I just lash it right across his face, hook him by the neck, and I just pull him to the ground next to me, and hopefully he, like, bonks his head on a rock or something.
Dungeon Master 02:50:55 All of that sick description and prep to pull him down just to hit, he accidentally hits a rock. Goes unconscious, falls for the thick thud. Crowd continues to erupt after reaction is the same, except this time you are conscious, but you did take a stress point.
Kaladin Shash 02:50:57 You didn't even do it.
Zariel Torgan 02:51:23 Yeah, for some reason my inventory only showed one from before. I thought I had taken two. Am I mistaken? Okay, so I'm up to... Oh, Leo has two? Oh. Okay, so yeah, I have two right now.
Kaladin Shash 02:51:29 Yeah, we've all had school. I have two right now. I've got two marked on my sheet. OK.
Dungeon Master 02:51:30 Oh, I mean I I didn't update it. So when you took an a second one, you would have. No, I think you have one and. Uh, how would it have to? I think it's two one in one, but now it's two two in one.
Leopold Magnus 02:51:44 Yeah, I think I only have one.
Zariel Torgan 02:51:56 I'll get up, and having burned all of my shit, well, I've still got a first level spell, I am gonna go sit down and try to start a short rest.
Dungeon Master 02:52:13 Delirious, he sort of just tries walking away. Kaladin, you get 300 gold for the win. And Leopold, you get 155. Sorry, no, that is 255. You bet 85. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:52:28 I, uh, as Ariel's walking out of the ring, I. Yeah. Oh, two 55. Okay. Hell yeah. So yeah, as Ariel's walking out of the ring, I, uh, I kind of, I knew you had it in you as Ariel and I hit him on the shoulder, but maybe it hurt a little more than it should. Considering you just got humbled. I kind of.
Zariel Torgan 02:52:48 I just, I die. My head falls off my body. I'm gonna crawl under a table, much like a dog, and just curl up.
Dungeon Master 02:52:51 You go unconscious. OK.
Leopold Magnus 02:52:56 gather you up and I'm like, oh dear, oh dear, get this man a stiff ale. And I run over to the bar and I try to force feed it to you and resuscitate you. Jonathan, you said $2.55? Got it.
Dungeon Master 02:53:23 Yes, 255 and 300. What are you guys doing? We have one person under a table.
Leopold Magnus 02:53:42 Oh, golly, that was a close one. You did have me a little afraid down there, Zariel.
Kaladin Shash 02:53:49 It was too close my friend, it was too close.
Zariel Torgan 02:53:49 Well, I thought at first maybe I had a guardian angel, but then maybe it's a masochistic one, because it just wanted me to keep getting killed and brought back and killed and brought back. I would not recommend that to anybody. Leo, I am very sorry that I pushed you into that pit.
Zariel Torgan 02:54:19 It was terrible.
Kaladin Shash 02:54:21 It was terrible.
Leopold Magnus 02:54:23 Oh, yes, that reminds me of my studies. There was this one monk masochist who used to love to take pummeled punches. It was quite the storied tale in the library. It was just a story and a fun book. Needless to say, it was a real one.
Dungeon Master 02:54:38 Not even the same universe. He exists across all planes. Has to be. We won. It is 1037. Do we want to do the last fight tonight or hold it for next time?
Zariel Torgan 02:54:56 Yeah. Yeah, I'll stay. I'll stay close enough to where I can be helpful.
Leopold Magnus 02:55:08 I mean, that's up to you guys. I mean, yeah, if you, if you want to rock through it, Brent, I mean, I get in that pit.
Dungeon Master 02:55:08 It'll probably take 20-ish minutes, depending on how it goes. Okay.
Kaladin Shash 02:55:13 Yeah, I wanna, yeah, I wanna go through it. That'd be fun to square it off. We can see how it goes. Cool.
Dungeon Master 02:55:31 Everything sort of settles down. The announcer comes out and screams out about the next fight. He holds his hands out to Kaladin, who now steps down the stairs into the ring, not having a name from you. Screams out,
Kaladin Shash 02:55:47 Cal, just call me Cal. I'm gonna...
Dungeon Master 02:55:54 Your opponent, and this other guy, the only one to have not fought so far, the man who stopped you before, jumps in, does a front flip before landing fairly gracefully. He goes, the boulder. Yes, you can.
Kaladin Shash 02:56:14 Can I, as I walk down the stairs, can I have cast a mirror image? Excellent. What's that? What was that, Jonathan?
Zariel Torgan 02:56:24 I would like to cast Fairy Fire. Oh, never mind, I don't do that. Nothing, go ahead.
Dungeon Master 02:56:24 across the arena before that. Thrag shouts out, he goes, caster, huh? So you won't mind if I don't hold back then. You the same.
Kaladin Shash 02:56:46 Do your best.
Dungeon Master 02:56:53 Go ahead and roll initiative and then same deal as before to you guys. As always, you can roll initiative if you want to do stuff or you can not roll initiative and just let me know if at some point you'd like to interject do something if need be like however you want to handle it.
Zariel Torgan 02:57:10 We'll just... I'll wait. Plus I only have one spell slot left, so if I cast Faerie Fire, I can't cast Heal. So I might wait on that.
Leopold Magnus 02:57:12 Yeah, that works for me.
Dungeon Master 02:57:28 You got a 12. He also got a 12. What is your DEX score? Oh, yeah, you go ahead of him. Easy. You have first jump. It is your go.
Kaladin Shash 02:57:30 We got a 12. Plus four is 19. OK. Mirrors. My first attack I'm gonna.
Kaladin Shash 02:57:58 When I dig out my inventory and I am going, I don't. You Jonathan, you may need to confirm this in my inventory. Right now I have. I have a scroll. Did we get to purchase a scroll or did I win one through the through the machine? Is that how I got it? OK. OK.
Dungeon Master 02:58:06 No, you got a ring of the grammarian from the machine, which has been added to your inventory. So that's there. I don't know about the scroll. You might have bought something from the shop. I don't know what it is. I'd have to look back.
Kaladin Shash 02:58:27 Right, that's right. That's how I can change a spell. I don't know if I would have bought in this. It would have been way too much. A scroll of fireballs in my inventory. OK, yes.
Dungeon Master 02:58:40 It could just also be part of your character's equipment that you get from whatever background you chose, maybe. Like if it doesn't say specifically what it is. What did you say, fireball or bolt?
Kaladin Shash 02:58:51 That's fine, I'm just gonna come out swinging. My first action will be to cast Fireball. It's a level above, so I'll have to roll a DC save on it, otherwise it's just wasted. Fireball. Right, I know, but it's a level, I can only cast level two spells as a wizard right now.
Dungeon Master 02:59:10 So deck save. He. And you can cast fireball. OK.
Kaladin Shash 02:59:19 The rule is if I cast something higher than my own ability, it becomes a DC. If I need a 10 plus 3 at the spell level. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. I'm pretty positive just to cast a scroll higher than your own ability. It's just a trick. I have a scroll of fireball.
Dungeon Master 02:59:44 Oh, you have a scroll of fireball. Gotcha, I am caught up. I was like, how do you know fireball if you can't cast that spell? Try to remember if I gave you something. OK, yeah, then roll me a. It'd be just a DC. 13 check that using your spellcasting modifier. You can't touch him.
Kaladin Shash 02:59:53 Yeah. I guess. Yeah. Alright, so this will be a one. So we have 1D20 plus 4.
Zariel Torgan 03:00:03 Guidance. I guide you. Is it touch? Dammit.
Dungeon Master 03:00:16 I think it is. Come on. It is.
Kaladin Shash 03:00:26 Really crummy roll there seven. I did. It's just wasted. It is just wasted Pretty cool. That's all right. That was my action my bonus action. I got no bonus actions
Dungeon Master 03:00:42 Uh, gotcha. We'll flavor it differently so that it wasn't just wasted. You go to cast it, but since you don't know it yet, you pull out the scroll and you go to read it and you see Thrag closes the distance instantly and he grabs it out of your hand and then he goes to hit you with the other one as he rips it from your grip, wasting it that way. Um, he will do, uh, his unarmed strike. It's also a d20.
Kaladin Shash 03:01:04 OK. That's great. I'm going to use, I'll use a reaction shield, so miss.
Zariel Torgan 03:01:09 You go to read it and it's in Comic Sans. It's through you.
Dungeon Master 03:01:11 Plus five. 19 to hit. Miss you see his. How does your shield manifest?
Kaladin Shash 03:01:34 it's it's um it's a saw it looks like it just emanates off of my armor like if if pulse armor or like beetle skin was a real thing it just glows right on top of like my entity just just pops into being yeah exactly right right just visible only every time it gets hit yeah
Dungeon Master 03:01:51 Oh, so right where it hits it glows it. Nice. Uh, he will take his second attack on you. Uh, 14 to hit. Not with your shield. Rolling real poorly. Uh, that is it then.
Kaladin Shash 03:02:11 It's great, it's missed. Yeah. Excellent, I'm gonna make. I'm gonna, I'm gonna try to land an attack or can I just use the charges for the sleep? Cause it looks like that's like a cast ability. It looks like. That's fine, I'm gonna do that.
Dungeon Master 03:02:33 Yeah, it is your action to do that. Go ahead and roll your, I believe it's like d8s worth of hit dice. Or do I have it written instead of it was a saving throw or something?
Kaladin Shash 03:02:50 Yeah, 5D8, I haven't seen the number there. Sends magical slumber, 5D8's the total. Remember, it's just like the spell, right? So the total number of hit points for the creatures that it can affect within a 20 foot radius. So let's get a 5D8 up here.
Dungeon Master 03:03:05 Okay.
Kaladin Shash 03:03:22 No, I only rolled one. That was lame. Oh, that was plus 5. That's ridiculous. So 7. I need to roll more of these. 4. All right, 7 plus. 14, 21. Is that eclipses? That doesn't eclipse his health, does it? All right, that's my icon.
Dungeon Master 03:03:44 and does not eclipse itself. You wave it in front of the spores flashing his face and you see he shakes it out and sort of smirks. Nice trick. Watch this one. And he goes to punch you right in the face. Jesus, I'm rolling like garbage. First one misses.
Kaladin Shash 03:04:12 It's okay, I need it right now. I need it. That still hits just straight up even with field.
Dungeon Master 03:04:17 23 to hit. Okay, when he hits the target, I can do one of the following effects. I can do, do you have like an obvious casting thing? Like is your fear your focus?
Kaladin Shash 03:04:45 I would say yes, I think my spear would be my focus because it was like the quarter staff right now.
Dungeon Master 03:04:51 He identifies as a threat, so he'll do his normal damage. Which is just d8 plus 3. But you also need to give me a dc13 strength saving throw. You take 4 points of damage.
Kaladin Shash 03:05:15 Bring it. You said it took four damage on that hit. OK. That's super lame.
Dungeon Master 03:05:18 8, he disarms you of your spear, hitting you in the wrist in a way that bends it and you open your grasp and then he just throws it to the ground and goes to move in front of it, but mechanically he can't get that close so he's just attempting to get it away from you. But that'll end his turn. Yeah, 4 damage on that hit.
Kaladin Shash 03:05:46 I'm gonna use a cantrip. I'm gonna do shocking grasp. Man. Just rolling turds over here. Just rolling turds. Is it close enough for me to pick up? Can I try to do some sort of? Alright, he's gonna pick it right back up. That is lame. It's my action.
Dungeon Master 03:05:50 Okay. Damn. Yeah, it's right at the ground. Okay, back on his turn.
Dungeon Master 03:06:19 Gonna keep just, all he's got are his hits. Natural one misses. Natural three misses. It is your turn. That's it.
Kaladin Shash 03:06:22 That's right. That's pop stuff, dude. That is pop stuff. I think I'll hit him with a second level magic missile.
Zariel Torgan 03:06:37 It's Kaladin's time.
Kaladin Shash 03:06:52 Actually, you know what? Yeah, we'll just just hits. That's going to be four missiles, so 44 plus four. That's that's a nice roll. That wasn't bad. Uh, chunky hit.
Dungeon Master 03:06:52 Okay, just hit. Yup. Nice, good hit. Chunky hit.
Zariel Torgan 03:07:07 Yeees.
Kaladin Shash 03:07:21 How did you like that? Like I said, I'm going to just stare right in front of his face. Can't really do much else. That is hot.
Dungeon Master 03:07:26 On his next turn, he responds through his teeth, smirking. He's like, I'm just happy you finally did something. I'll go to hit you a couple more times with a natural three misses. Natural eight becomes a 13 that misses. Dang. Your turn again. He's starting to sweat a little bit.
Kaladin Shash 03:07:51 Woo. All right, I'm gonna. Oh my God, okay. I'm gonna try. I'm gonna try to use a two-handed strike with the spear. Because he's close enough that I'd have disadvantages if I try to do anything other than another jockeying grasp or something. That's such a good hit.
Dungeon Master 03:08:06 mhm mhm 19 hits
Kaladin Shash 03:08:20 I'll do shocking because it's just it's right there. I'll do shocking grass. 19 to hit. Problem for another 7. I'm just gonna. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 03:08:35 Nice. Dune's Endurance. Oh.
Dungeon Master 03:08:35 seven he will use his uh no he won't he's got something like that but he's not gonna he's not not dire enough for that yet he'll just take that he goes to he's trying to reach at you but he can't uh
Kaladin Shash 03:08:50 I'm just going to walk right past him knowing he can't react. Just going to just slowly stroll from my movement. What's the matter? No, just he can't react. That's all it is. No reaction.
Dungeon Master 03:09:06 That is his turn. He doesn't lose movement or anything, does he? He'll jump back in and close the distance. He'll go for like a punch and a kick combo, just like a swinging roundhouse. Maybe I hit now, 16.
Kaladin Shash 03:09:32 Uh, yeah, but I'm going to roll because I do have mirror image app. I should have done it the first time, so he hit the he hit the mirror image. Go again. Does it automatically have to roll even if he misses? Let's that's that's that's a beauty roll right there. Just missed me.
Dungeon Master 03:09:39 Okay, so hits the mirror image and then a second attack misses, but rolled to see if it hits the mirror image instead. Yeah, you have to, you gotta roll it. Nice.
Kaladin Shash 03:10:00 Yeah. Still didn't really want to try. Right, he's got no reaction right now or we know we're top of the order again, right? OK. This is just so stinking tight.
Dungeon Master 03:10:07 Uh, then it's your turn. Back and he can't do anything. Can't do anything and can't hit. Yeah, he just went so on his turn he got his reaction back.
Kaladin Shash 03:10:38 I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to try to cast sleep again. I'm going to use another charge on it. So it's going to be the 5D8, right? OK, a little beefier. 24, not enough still. I'm wondering if those two hits took him down enough. That's OK. I wanted it. I wanted it. That's it.
Dungeon Master 03:10:47 Let's go for it. Yeah. Still not down. Getting closer though. Okay, any bonus action? You see his turn. He looks frustrated, but
Kaladin Shash 03:11:09 No bonus actions right now. I don't have any spells that work as a bonus action. Yeah, I mean, it hits no matter what. Yeah, it hits no matter what.
Dungeon Master 03:11:15 Literally all he can do is try to hit you. Natural 20 for 25. He will use his suplex ability. Give me a DC 13 strength saving throw or be knocked prone. And you will take the damage on that. Oh, uh,
Kaladin Shash 03:11:41 Yes, all the two and three total. Yep.
Dungeon Master 03:11:46 That is 8 ti- I need to roll out a d8. So far it's 11 plus 14 plus 3, 17 damage to you. And then you failed, so you are knocked prone. Which means his second attack has advantage. Oh yes, go ahead, see if it-
Kaladin Shash 03:12:10 No, I should have rolled. I should have rolled for my dummy. But that was. Yeah. Yeah. It's my other mirror. I'm gonna give myself back the 17. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:12:15 See if that hits your other mirror. Okay, so your mirror was suplexed and was knocked down and is gone, but you did not take that damage. And then a second attack is just normal. Good call on that.
Zariel Torgan 03:12:28 Nice.
Dungeon Master 03:12:45 Uh, Jesus him back to nine. Okay You were go sir
Kaladin Shash 03:12:47 Yes. That's fantastic. We cast.
Kaladin Shash 03:13:13 I can't get enough space to use any of my range. I'm going to cast, he's got too much decks. I'm going to try to, I'll just try to get him with another,
Dungeon Master 03:13:33 Going to shock and grasp again. I don't know. Does it say you can pull them, or does it say it does pull them?
Kaladin Shash 03:13:40 If I do lightning lure, can I choose to not pull them towards me? Right, that's just an option. It says make a strength saving throw, will be pulled up to 10 feet. Like I get to choose the distance I pull. So I could say no, I could say, I mean he's already right in front of my face, so it doesn't matter, but yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:14:03 You can pull one foot if you'd want it. Right, yeah, so you could just not move him away. Or if you wanted to, you could move him, does it say towards you or move them 10 feet? Does it specify?
Kaladin Shash 03:14:17 Nope, it just says pulled so just as pulled. It's okay. It's a string. That's right. He's right in front of me. I got my best options still Go big we got to take him down. I'm gonna I'll do guys Texas good. He's lame Do I know Do I know it is have I know do I have an idea what his armor his tip point is yet or is a CME
Dungeon Master 03:14:38 This deck's amazing Uh, I don't know have you rolled exactly it yet. I don't think so Okay
Kaladin Shash 03:14:49 Who is this? I don't know if it's OK, it's OK. I'm going to try to do a two handed strike with my my quarter staff right now. Oh, for Nat 20, because it's supposed to happen. I got I got right.
Dungeon Master 03:15:08 That's a 20. Okay. Roll that damage times by 2. Don't forget it also does poison damage that I don't think it... I don't think it automatically adds it.
Zariel Torgan 03:15:11 Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Kaladin Shash 03:15:18 I got super soft on. No, I'm trying to roll right now. It's just a 1D4 or put a 1D4 on top of that. Bummer. For one more man just couldn't roll any softer on that. Oh, the initial damage was. Did it not load? I can't even see it.
Dungeon Master 03:15:39 What was the initial damage? It didn't tell me. No, it didn't say anything. It's like it's still doing it. Go ahead and reroll it. OK, so the 1D4 is, you have another D4, because it's 1D8 plus 1D4. You crit, so it's 2D8 plus 2D4.
Zariel Torgan 03:15:49 I mean.
Kaladin Shash 03:15:52 Oh. Oh man, OK. OK, so it's OK, so I need to do a 1D8 or so it's the roll. 2D8
Dungeon Master 03:16:13 Plus 1D4. 14, nice. And that 2 is doubled, so it's 16.
Kaladin Shash 03:16:31 So 14? I don't know. I don't know why it took a 1-8. Oh, because that was 2-D-8. Okay, perfect. Sweet. The poison damage, does it take a poison defect or is it just poison damage? All right.
Zariel Torgan 03:16:35 Nice.
Dungeon Master 03:16:44 Let me do the math. Okay, turn. Anything else? No, just poison damage. Okay, he's looking worse off than you at this point. On his turn, he's going to try to hit you.
Kaladin Shash 03:17:00 Was better around I still have one more image floating around me. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:17:16 Natural 19. He's gonna do his normal damage plus a disarm. So go ahead and give me that strength save again. Uh, nice. Yeah, 8 damage on his second attack. Premier image, go ahead.
Kaladin Shash 03:17:30 Sweet, saved it. Holding on. And is that eight damage right there? Oh, wait. I should have rolled. It was my mirror image. It's the mirror image on that first one. OK, so this one I'll take damage on.
Dungeon Master 03:17:47 He's got 23 to hit. Okay, so then he hits you with this one on damage. And he'll try the disarm again. He takes six damage.
Kaladin Shash 03:18:13 Rockers and 18 just flopped over that sweet four. I'll do shocking grass. Not 20.
Dungeon Master 03:18:19 uh, knocks out your weapon. Uh, and then I'll say, I'm not going to let him grab it all. So we'll say he used his full action. So, okay. It is your turn then. Okay.
Kaladin Shash 03:18:45 for 10 more damage. I'm gonna pick up my, pick up my spear. Just keeps fucking taking it from me. I'll walk past him. Got lucky on those.
Zariel Torgan 03:18:50 Nice.
Dungeon Master 03:19:01 On his turn, furious, he jumps up after you. Two more attacks. A lot of crits from you. First one and misses. The 19 hits. Okay. 24 misses then. Okay. Your turn.
Kaladin Shash 03:19:19 I'll use my last spell slot shield. I'm gonna I'm gonna use my sleep my last sleep charge. Oh, there we go. 27 it's gotta have less than 27. I'm gonna love that.
Dungeon Master 03:19:36 OK. 27. He falls asleep. If he is sleeping, you automatically crit, right?
Zariel Torgan 03:19:48 Yeah, the fight's over.
Kaladin Shash 03:19:50 I'm just going to take advantage. I'm sure right on a stabbing strike at this point, right? I win, this is just loops alright. Oh, then I just correct. It's just not doing. OK, yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:20:04 No, I mean, you don't win, but I think... I think that's the same as incapacitated, right? Jesse, would you agree on that as the DM? Well, I mean, he didn't wake up if he takes, like, damage and it doesn't, you know, take him out, but you auto-hit and you auto-crit, so go ahead and just roll, like, whatever you're gonna do melee attack-wise, it'll be an auto-crit.
Zariel Torgan 03:20:13 Yeah, the fight's over. It's not like murder. If it was murder. Yeah, you're right. But it's supposed to be like a tavern brawl kind of thing.
Kaladin Shash 03:20:32 That would be the crit. That'd be the crit damage right there. Plus poison, 02, 2d4. Yeah. Twirling slow, there it goes. Six more, dude. 23, what a hit. Woo.
Dungeon Master 03:20:35 Plus the poison. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:20:54 No, you're good. He only had 17 hit points, I just wanted you to get the extra damage. As you do this quick succession of moves, how do you want to finish him?
Zariel Torgan 03:20:55 Jesus.
Kaladin Shash 03:21:06 Uhm, it's fun that it happened with the spear. I think I think while he was unconscious, I would. I would hold the quarter staff out in front of me and it would just slowly telescope from both ends into a full size spear. And spin it and I would just I just thrust it straight down into him. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:21:28 right into his chest. Spewing blood, he starts to die. He looks concerned. And with that victory, we are gonna call it for the night.
Kaladin Shash 03:21:36 I'm just I'm just making eye contact with Cedric the whole time. That's good, that's sweet. That worked really well in my favor. That was close. The mirror image was helpful and I had two shields to burn. One missile that was all that was all my stuff. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 03:21:52 That was crazy. Yeah, no, that was fantastic.
Dungeon Master 03:22:02 But before we close it out, and before we get too out of it, you see Cedric stands up. He walks to the edge of the rink, and he just goes, well, that was pretty interesting, actually. Mind if I jump in?
Kaladin Shash 03:22:23 Yeah, we've got, is that an invite for everyone? Cause he's like speaking just to me. Yeah, we're, we're so hurt. Yeah, tell them we'll drink a few beers and then we'll be ready to go.
Dungeon Master 03:22:32 He's speaking to all of you. He steps and drops down into the sandy arena. He holds his hands up and he flexes and the ground shakes beneath him.
Zariel Torgan 03:22:38 Yeah, give me 30 minutes.
Leopold Magnus 03:22:38 Yeah, yeah, he wants to fight. Or is he just like trying to talk?
Kaladin Shash 03:22:54 Let us have a drink. Let us. All right.
Dungeon Master 03:23:00 You guys feel a surge of like oppressive force around your bodies. Your adrenaline starts pumping and you guys all gain the benefits of a long rest as you level up to level four. That is correct.

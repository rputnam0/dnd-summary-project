Dungeon Master 00:00:00 now recording it right anyway last time we uh visited the odiers you had just emerged out of the water following your fight with the huge arachnid monster the omniscient eye
Dungeon Master 00:00:24 You're successfully crushing them and making your way through. You had this lapse in your memory where you just couldn't remember anything that had happened. And you ended up bedding down for the night, starting over the next day.
Dungeon Master 00:00:43 Through the Alarian district, you guys searched various buildings and towers, picking up little bits here and there in total. And at one point, thought you saw something, but it ended up being nothing. Finally, you made your way towards the core tower of the High Council, every floor presenting its own little challenge for you.
Dungeon Master 00:01:06 You guys deciphered each little riddle and puzzle, got some lore, and partway through out of boredom, Cyrus sort of bailed out with help of a friend, Zario. And you guys, looking around, didn't see much, but then at some point, it was Cyrus, right, who failed?
Cyrus Schwert 00:01:35 On which one? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:01:36 I think so. I could look it up. I just finished the transcript.
Dungeon Master 00:01:38 You got hit by another sort of thing where you were stunned and the whole party heard
Zariel Torgan 00:01:42 Oh, it's like a one, right?
Dungeon Master 00:01:47 that you were affected by something and then the rest that came out, it was both of you actually, the party came out and saw you just sort of looking over the edge of the city, unmoving, just sort of hazy-eyed. And we left off with you guys just sort of hearing the brush in trees behind you, the large bamboo, sort of rustle as something had just finished moving
Cletus Cobbington 00:01:54 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:01:58 Yep.
Dungeon Master 00:02:17 past it in the periphery of your vision. So as you guys stand there, it is later in the day. It's just past midday, but it's not in the evening yet. Sun's just past sort of its apex. And you guys don't hear anything. Again, there's no real bird sound in this area. It's just always eerily very silent.
Cletus Cobbington 00:02:38 Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:02:45 There is the one instance of sound. What would you guys like to do in this moment? Yes, that was also something you were going to do.
Leopold Magnus 00:03:00 hmm that's hats yeah you you didn't make it to pat's hats yeah
Zariel Torgan 00:03:01 The priority is hats, right? Yeah. Has the water level receded low enough to where we... Or is it still... It's still the same time, isn't it? Oh, okay. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:03:05 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:03:12 you
Kaladen Shash 00:03:17 No, it's been another day. Oh, actually, no time has passed. Yeah, I thought we took... Oh, so we all woke up from that effort.
Dungeon Master 00:03:17 Yeah, no time. No, they had looked at the haberdashery in the water, saw that it was still submerged. And they were like, let's come back to this. And that's when everything went down. That happened the previous night. Or you did it in the tower.
Zariel Torgan 00:03:31 Didn't we... I thought we went down for the night because I thought I scryed at the end of the night. Oh. Oh, okay. Alright. Okay. I kind of thought we did. I got the wrong sheet open. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:03:49 Did you guys take a long rest right there? I don't remember the order necessarily. I don't think anybody had bent anything, so that's why it's hard to tell. Regardless, if you wanted to take a long rest, you could have.
Kaladen Shash 00:03:52 What's my character sheet at? I think we did, because my sheets got full. Yeah, I have all my spell slots.
Cletus Cobbington 00:03:55 Yeah, we ended with a rest.
Leopold Magnus 00:04:11 Hold on, I'm looking. Let's see. Well, did we clear the whole of the towers? Yeah. So we're just kind of waiting then.
Zariel Torgan 00:04:19 Well, what do you guys think? Do you want to wait or do you want to keep moving, get through the rest of the towers and stuff?
Kaladen Shash 00:04:31 We cleared the main tower. We did the whole tower. I don't know if there's other buildings. I don't know if we want to do other buildings or what the idea is there. We have two... Right now we've got two options as far as what our next step is. It's either try to get back... Yeah, we still need to find the true teleportation circle, is that what you're saying?
Dungeon Master 00:04:31 You did the whole tower.
Cyrus Schwert 00:04:51 Mm-hmm.
Zariel Torgan 00:04:52 Well, we still haven't found... Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:05:02 Yeah, yeah. And then we've got, Jonathan, remind me, we received a scroll that helps us identify a way, potentially, or just says there is a way to teleport to the tree. Okay, okay.
Dungeon Master 00:05:16 You found a scroll that if you aligned it on the correct teleportation circle, it would tell you the runes to change to alter the destination to somewhere. You have to find it. No, you just have to find the circle and then like with a group check or something, you know, whatever three successes you'll
Zariel Torgan 00:05:30 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:05:33 We have to find some parts, right? OK.
Kaladen Shash 00:05:34 We're going to figure out how to orient to the right spot. So it's headed up. Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:05:45 be able to change it. Okay. Oh, no. Absolutely did not.
Leopold Magnus 00:05:47 um yeah so i yeah i would say let's do that i did look it up and we did long rest and got a scry in and then jonathan i did find that there was a scroll while we were swimming in the city did you check the loot table for what was in that scroll it was a separate one of that it was like it wasn't the map it was a second one that i found
Zariel Torgan 00:06:06 It was teleport, wasn't it? Oh.
Kaladen Shash 00:06:09 Diligency, yes. Just inspiration points.
Leopold Magnus 00:06:15 while we were swimming amongst other submerged wet ones. Right. Okay. No worries. I'm sure at some point it will come in handy.
Dungeon Master 00:06:16 No. He found something, but the lore item that was just generic was just like described a enchanted looking scroll. It wasn't actually a thing. So we just didn't create anything and I didn't do it because I forgot about that part. I just have to decide what it does.
Leopold Magnus 00:06:46 but to that end what's that yeah you know but something to have fun with those little things can come in handy depending on how creative you are anyways you do need a hat
Dungeon Master 00:06:50 I promise you, though, it's just a generic thing. It's not going to be some super-powered scroll thing. Like, I don't want you to get your hopes up. It's just going to be, like, an uncommon item. It's true. The whole time, you were like, are you fucking kidding me? We could have this thing.
Zariel Torgan 00:06:50 Probably give my character. Oh, go ahead. Yeah, it's probably a scroll of hat making.
Kaladen Shash 00:07:02 Yes, there you go.
Cletus Cobbington 00:07:14 Holy shit. After all the hats are so wet and soggy, we need that scroll. Just like mine after hard rain. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:22 I know. I'm going to have the most mildewy fucking hat. It's going to give me bacterial infections. Yeah. So what do we say? Do we want to go to the next tower? Keep looking for the circle?
Leopold Magnus 00:07:30 You know, maybe they're just perfectly preserved
Cletus Cobbington 00:07:44 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:07:44 If there are other buildings of interest, I say, yeah, because that's where we're assuming we're going to find the circles, within a building or at the base of the building. It was in the core. We had smaller circles that we could teleport to on the spokes. I think there was a central circle landing pad. Isn't that where we got sent from?
Zariel Torgan 00:07:52 Where was our circle in our dome? Wasn't it on the edge of a top of a wall or something? It was on a wall. Oh.
Leopold Magnus 00:08:03 It was like on the wall, wasn't it?
Cyrus Schwert 00:08:07 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:08:08 Yeah. You guys got sent from a wizard who cast teleport based on the general guidelines because it wasn't an established circle. But you know in New Armor there are teleportation circles
Kaladen Shash 00:08:15 in the middle of the core. Yep.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:24 Oh, it's like call forwarding. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:08:30 on sort of the individual walls at certain points that take you to the core and then the main teleportation chamber and the core takes you out long distances if you needed it. Yeah. Oh.
Kaladen Shash 00:08:48 Yeah, so yeah, let's keep looking through buildings and hopefully find the circle. And then we choose next steps. Right. Right. So how far is the water down?
Leopold Magnus 00:08:53 Oh, set. Are you on the hat? So should we make some effort for that? Are you set? Right.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:59 Oh, I think we get a... The whole reason. Yeah. Alright. Damn it.
Dungeon Master 00:08:59 Well, actually, if you guys, if you had long rested, it was you waiting for the water to train for the half. That was part of the reason you did that. Roll me somebody. I think it actually, it has to be Zario who's so invested in this. Roll me a D20. If it is, hold on. One through 10, completely underwater still.
Cyrus Schwert 00:09:11 Absolutely.
Cletus Cobbington 00:09:12 Like most of the reason.
Dungeon Master 00:09:29 if it is 10 through 14, it is like waist high. And if it's 15 plus, it's been drained. It is the building is submerged, but like the roof is exposed. Like
Zariel Torgan 00:09:39 All right, I'm going to use luck. God damn it. No, I don't have luck. I just wanted it to work. It's still underwater.
Cyrus Schwert 00:09:40 Come on, this is huge. Yeah, you are.
Cletus Cobbington 00:09:45 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:09:51 It's well underwater. Go get it.
Dungeon Master 00:09:58 It would be a hassle to go in and out, but you could get in there.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:04 Now, I guess question to you, Jonathan. What kind of mechanical support would this dome have? I guess it was pretty fey-like. So was it all natural and nature-based? Or did they have certain mechanical, whether there was underground pumps or other service tunnels or things that would service the core?
Dungeon Master 00:10:26 You'd see very natural style tunnels. Like it was carved into the ground and stone and everything. It wasn't like a very steam punky. And yeah, there's like, there are lanterns, but they're like carved wood with like an enchantment held in bulbs. It's not based on like a power service in the same way. So very nature-based. You have the right idea with like, there's not a ton of technology around.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:37 Got it, okay. Okay, understood.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:04 So roughly how long would it take for me to run down the stairs and then swim over to that building? Let me see if I can just use a spell that would make it a little easier. How far are we talking here?
Dungeon Master 00:11:14 how hard do you want to push yourself I don't know man this is not this wasn't on my bucket list of things to do
Leopold Magnus 00:11:23 Does anyone have shape water? And then prep for Pat's hats.
Cyrus Schwert 00:11:33 You didn't prep for this? You got to be ready for everything.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:43 This is the endgame, dude. Well, as a matter of fact, I am. I'm currently thinking about...
Kaladen Shash 00:11:43 What?
Dungeon Master 00:11:43 No, hold on. Let me pull something up. It's not.
Leopold Magnus 00:11:55 Oh, Zario, that bald spot on there, quite unsightly. Are you thinking about getting a hat for that?
Zariel Torgan 00:12:08 How difficult it will be to get down there. I really don't know. You'd think I could just look. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:12:12 If you took the path that like the established road and stairway system, it would probably be like three miles of walking. If you jumped directly down because I put you guys on the full district map, you're like, I don't know if it's loaded in yet.
Dungeon Master 00:12:43 you're like in this sort of edge up here and you would be trying to go down here. So it's like hundreds foot drop, like straight down. Well, at an angle or you go all the way sort of around the city to it. Mm hmm.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:43 You know, I... Yeah. Yeah. So, I know some people that can run, like, a 5K in, like, 25 minutes, and that's, like, three and a half miles without, like, dying. Could I just jog down...
Kaladen Shash 00:13:09 You're a robot. You're a robot. You can manage. You can manage whatever speed you want.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:12 and jog back while they're having breakfast or something, or before they get up, because I don't need a full eight hours. I don't want to waste everybody's time. Yeah, established. Everybody knows. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:13:22 Sure. Yeah. I think that's fine.
Cletus Cobbington 00:13:28 One thing about Zariel, he's an amazing 5k runner. Like the first thing I noticed when I joined the group, when we met up. And outrageous dad caps.
Cyrus Schwert 00:13:35 You won a silver medal. In a 5K.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:42 He's got a large amount of nipple tape to keep the chafing. Whenever we're dungeon delving, I'm behind somebody to resist the air resistance for drafting. Yeah, yeah. I want to get down there. Does anybody want to go with me? Or should I just do this real quick?
Leopold Magnus 00:13:46 Oh, you don't want those bleeding. All I'll go with you because I don't need to rest.
Cletus Cobbington 00:13:56 He gets that boost from Mario Kart.
Dungeon Master 00:13:58 You're always drafting. Yeah. So you are... The two automatons run anywhere.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:15 Like, I don't need to rest all night. Yeah. Now, I did some math, and my walking speed is 30 feet around, which is six seconds. And so, like, if you calculate it out, it's about 20 minutes to the mile. 17.6. So... Oh, yeah, I'm taking dashes. So, yeah, cut that in half. And...
Cyrus Schwert 00:14:24 Double it, because you're taking dash accents. That's normal.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:32 That's slow as fuck. 10 minute mile. This guy can punch a building in half. Yeah. That's better. That's better. Yeah. Yeah, that was the
Dungeon Master 00:14:39 Half the time. I love this.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:43 You're talking 8.8 minute mile. Yeah, 8.8 minute mile. So just under nines. Yep. Yeah. Okay, so we'll jog over there. Hey, I wanted to keep that real, you know.
Kaladen Shash 00:14:48 There you go. That's right where you quoted it, 25. That's right where it was.
Cyrus Schwert 00:14:58 Good thing we figured that out. What kind of hat do you get, man? I think a bucket hat would be cool.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:02 the linchpin in the success of this session. Cyrus? Before we went to bed, I'll be like, hey Cyrus, you might have been going with me just for funsies, but I'm thinking of going early. Is there a specific hat you might want? Yeah. Any
Cletus Cobbington 00:15:07 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:15:24 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:15:28 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:15:29 Not like a fisherman, but more like, you know, I don't know. I don't know much about hats. Well, they would probably go well with my Nike Jordan 1s, for sure. No, I was just going because I got...
Zariel Torgan 00:15:32 Yeah. Like, more trendy. Yeah. Yeah. No, like, bass on it or nothing. Yeah. I'll take a shoot for reference. Aww.
Cletus Cobbington 00:15:35 like a supreme one you find in Mexico.
Cyrus Schwert 00:15:57 Because I just felt like he needed a buddy. I'm not going to wake up early and I don't need a hat. I need my beauty sleep. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:16:04 Is that a billy bong? Billabong?
Zariel Torgan 00:16:04 Alright, I'll get you one. Alright. We'll head out.
Dungeon Master 00:16:12 Okay, you guys are running out. It's a beautiful morning as you guys are jogging. You don't hear anything because there's like no natural wildlife sound. It's really eerie. But just like your footsteps, like instant echo as it hits distant surfaces, almost like the dull thud with every step. Absorb, but simultaneously you hear it at a distance away. The light filters in through the sort of...
Dungeon Master 00:16:39 old dirty arcane glass above so there's kind of a haze to the light that kind of ambiently fills the space the water is nearly completely receded just in the sort of bottom two districts at this point as you guys are sort of long winding down this staircase running at a decline so it's a little harder on your knees but it makes for pretty good pace because you can just very casually go down the stairs
Cyrus Schwert 00:16:51 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:17:03 You clear through the different districts, running through streets. You don't come into any problems. And then finally you hit the district that you need to get into, Lorendo. And it's the second lowest district. So there is water still kind of at rooftop level for some buildings. Most of the roofs are exposed. So you could sort of...
Cyrus Schwert 00:17:26 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:17:27 jump this map is just rough it was for a different district even but as you guys what you would see is a bunch of buildings very close together of varying heights you could sort of park or through the rooftops or as robots you don't need to breathe and you guys we've established are heavy so you could walk through the water into the building and go through the front door essentially
Kaladen Shash 00:17:51 like you're shopping.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:53 Yeah, we'll just Pirates of the Caribbean it. We'll just walk.
Dungeon Master 00:17:56 Yeah. At first you grab a boat and you hold it over your head. Yeah. And then as you're walking, as per like physics, the water escapes through the little holes and you're just walking with it even though the whole boat is submerged in water too and you just drop it off to the side. And as you guys...
Leopold Magnus 00:17:57 With a boat? Yeah
Cletus Cobbington 00:18:00 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 00:18:13 Walk forward, it's equally beautiful underwater. There is aquatic grasses and different types of seaweed and everything that sort of flow with the general flow as the water filters in. It's shallow enough that it's like a light blue color. The buildings disappear into darkness because there's no light that kind of filters in. So it's little dark crevices everywhere you walk. But as you get to Pat's Haberdashery,
Dungeon Master 00:18:40 um in parentheses it's it's it's pat's hats but the full name is patrick's haberdashery did you guys um go in do you say a prayer how do you appreciate this moment
Zariel Torgan 00:18:47 You're like, well, this is a lot more effort than I originally intended, but we're here. Should we go in? What the fuck are you talking about? What are you saying right now?
Cletus Cobbington 00:18:53 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:19:03 Perfect, perfect.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:06 Oh, indeed. Last time I was here, it was a strapping shop. Huh? What? Pat's hats? I told you it was the most renowned haberdashery in Moonhaven. Well, um...
Dungeon Master 00:19:13 No, no he is not.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:17 All right. I'll just. What is happening? Have you been here before? Are you fucking with me? I can't read patient cues. All right, we'll go in it.
Cyrus Schwert 00:19:35 What is happening?
Leopold Magnus 00:19:38 I don't know if I've, well, let's just go in and take a look.
Dungeon Master 00:19:43 uh you go in it's very dark you see um algae covered shelves um gentle flowing grasses they kind of creep in but don't go too deep because there'd be no light for them to filter and they would die so it kind of just kind of looks really sad and decrepit as you go deeper in but the you can sort of if you have any sources of light you can
Dungeon Master 00:20:10 generate, I'm sure between the two of you, you have some sort of spell that does that. But you could sort of light up the space, and both of you go ahead and give me, and I said this is going to have to be an investigation check, so it'll be good for one of you, bad for the other, as you search through for something wearable, maybe magic, something fun.
Leopold Magnus 00:20:32 Tough. Nice.
Zariel Torgan 00:20:34 Can I help? Oh, maybe not. Yeah, I'll do my own, because that one was... If we don't get a hat, I swear. 18. We're going to go in there and find out.
Kaladen Shash 00:20:43 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:20:47 17 plus 1. Leopold, you see an array like a whole shelf dedicated to it of little black bowler caps, but none of them are enchanted or reinforced. So they're so faded, soaked, and gross looking. Some of them are nibbled, but they do exist. You're not really finding anything else of worth. Maybe like
Cletus Cobbington 00:21:09 you
Dungeon Master 00:21:14 You search the register and you get like two gold or something. And then Zara, you're looking around one of the shelves and you see underneath algae. When you swipe it aside, you see is a surprisingly well preserved hat. It's like a tricorn style where it's sort of pointed, but like flat rim. And it comes up in the front and it's on the back and there's like a feather that comes off of it.
Dungeon Master 00:21:39 It's very ostentatious, but it's like surprisingly well kept. And it's one of the only things in here with an 18 that you can ascertain as like, okay, this might be something.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:42 Well, I'll be. I'll reach up and I'll just kind of clean it off a little. I'll grab it and I'll plop it on, see if it fits. Does it fit decent?
Dungeon Master 00:22:00 Yeah, you put it on your head and it sort of shrinks down and fits your head very nicely. Leopold, you look over and it's a nice hat, but you have this weird urge sort of onset you where you feel like he just kind of looks like a douche.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:24 Like the fedora of D&D. Oh, wow.
Leopold Magnus 00:22:27 Oh, Zario, that had quite the impact on you. How are you feeling? Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:22:36 This is not an item that I formally created yet, but this hat is called Counter's Charm. While wearing the hat, you have a plus two to all charisma-based checks, but you have disadvantage on those checks.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:54 Nice. Nice. I think I think it's nice. Can I? I would like to find at least a couple other hats. I don't care what they look like. I'd like to look for specifically like a mariachi hat, the wide flat broom with the little balls that hang.
Cyrus Schwert 00:22:54 Bye-bye.
Dungeon Master 00:23:01 It's a nice hat. It looks really dashing in it, but there's just something really kind of air cocky coming off about it. Give me another investigation check.
Leopold Magnus 00:23:19 If we're going to look a little bit further, can I look for a brown suede top hat? Let's see if it rolls any better. Oh, tough. 17 is better than what it was.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:22 Is there one of those? Damn it. Yeah. Got an 11. It's not.
Kaladen Shash 00:23:27 A large sombrero to go hunting for.
Cyrus Schwert 00:23:32 We've been in the woods for a long time. We're ready for a life of luxury.
Cletus Cobbington 00:23:36 well there goes all our stealth checks
Dungeon Master 00:23:36 Go for it. Investigation check. Leopold, you find it's not... It's well-maintained, but you can tell by looking at it that this, like...
Dungeon Master 00:24:00 Brown probably because it's been underwater so long that it's like stained out and it's not as black as it was. But it's like held together. It's not falling apart. It's like, it's magical in the sense that it's reinforced, but it's not magical in the sense that it's enchanted.
Dungeon Master 00:24:17 And you can kind of, like, as you look it over and sort of flow your magic and try to get some sort of sense of it, you can kind of ascertain that. You can clean it up pretty nicely. You've got the ability to do that. You can create a haberdasher's tools with your tinkering. And then, Zariel, with an 11, you don't find a sort of mariachi hat or anything, but you find a form of
Leopold Magnus 00:24:17 Nice. Sweet.
Dungeon Master 00:24:43 that you could, if you wanted to, take kind of bulky and burdensome, but you could make your own mariachi hat, but that's all you find. It's just like a large, flat sort of cone shape where you would press it onto. You can give you one more investigation check, and this will be the highest DC.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:53 All right. Gotcha. No bucket hat either down here. I really. Yeah, we should grab as many as we can.
Leopold Magnus 00:25:03 Yeah, I would walk up to Zariel and be like, Oh, Zariel, if you, me, and someone else in the gang has a hat, it'd be a shame if we all didn't have one. And I will also look for a bucket hat with Billy the Big Mouth Bass on it.
Cyrus Schwert 00:25:15 Don't worry about things.
Cletus Cobbington 00:25:26 Heh heh.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:26 So I got seven. Take me to the river.
Leopold Magnus 00:25:28 Maybe it could have a little battery pack in there so I can animate a fish so it flops around. It plays, it plays. All right, we'll see how this one goes. Ah, some pretty low rolls, bummer.
Dungeon Master 00:25:29 I didn't see anything. Same thing, give me a little check. Yeah, you guys just don't really find anything. Again, it's to have such specific requests on a city that existed and has been underwater, you kind of, it's a call order, but
Cyrus Schwert 00:25:49 No.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:59 All right.
Dungeon Master 00:25:59 I think maybe it dawns or doesn't dawn on either of you that Leopold's sort of whistling to himself underwater as he's looking through these hats. And you're looking at him and you're like, he can make these tools and he can summon these items with the shop. And Leopold could make hats if he really tried. That's in his skill set as he's looking through these old fabrics.
Kaladen Shash 00:26:05 Thanks.
Leopold Magnus 00:26:21 All right, I'll do one check. Can I find a manual or some kind of instruction guide to see if they have the recipes for their hats so that way it doesn't take me a long time to put them together? I can maybe accelerate the build process. All right.
Cyrus Schwert 00:26:34 This is crazy.
Dungeon Master 00:26:39 I mean, I described the hat as disintegrating. So give me a check on a Nat 20. You find like a magical directions manual of how to make hats.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:40 I'll help.
Kaladen Shash 00:26:50 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:26:52 Ah, not Nat 20, but 21. Bummer.
Dungeon Master 00:26:55 30, 21. You find exactly what you're looking for, but you like go to grab it and you just kind of go through it as it like just fades into silt into the water and kind of disperses and your body kind of like fake breathes in remnants of the book. But no, don't see anything.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:15 Well, I think we got what we came for. We say we head back. I'll tip it back. I want to spend I want to spend the time walking back or jogging back, just ripping the sombrero into like a bucket hat, you know, just where it comes down, just like a little lip around the edge. Just kind of like.
Leopold Magnus 00:27:19 Oh, dear. Yes, indeed. And I tip my hat to him.
Kaladen Shash 00:27:33 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:27:37 Mm-hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 00:27:42 But the balls. There's no way. There you go. You literally have balls in your eyes all day now.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:42 I'm just trying to make it. I'll save the balls. I'll rip the balls off, and I'm going to put the balls on the end of the bucket hat. It's like a bucket hat with little balls that hang. All right. We'll come back.
Cyrus Schwert 00:27:44 Yeah, keep the balls. It's scotch tape.
Leopold Magnus 00:27:56 That's great.
Dungeon Master 00:28:09 Okay. As you guys are making your way back, you're going to the different districts. Very beautiful. Everybody, how far did I say you were away? A few miles. Okay. Yeah. Go ahead and give me both of you a wisdom saving throw. And for general context, it's a spell
Cletus Cobbington 00:28:20 Oh, stop.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:21 Three miles.
Kaladen Shash 00:28:36 Because you're just gonna fall. But that's a plus two with disadvantage.
Leopold Magnus 00:28:38 oh nice that hat's coming in handy I got nothing to help out with that this is just straight up not good with advantage
Dungeon Master 00:28:40 So if you have resistance against that, you'd have advantage. And if you have anything that gives you a benefit on a charmed effect, you could have advantage against that. Saving from one ability check.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:02 I got a 14. I think I get advantage, do I? Well, and this is wisdom, not charisma, isn't it? Oh, I...
Leopold Magnus 00:29:11 don't you have that hat isn't that one that does oh i see yeah
Dungeon Master 00:29:12 This might be check, not saving throws. Oh, it is also with them. Okay. We'll come back to that, but it is back to the main party.
Kaladen Shash 00:29:16 Oh.
Cletus Cobbington 00:29:21 You.
Dungeon Master 00:29:32 You guys are sort of sitting around. You would be in the willow probably at this point. You're in your sort of Pletus's magnificent hut. And you're just sort of hanging out by the fire, making small chat. At this point, if it's like 20 minutes to get there on a faster pace, look around 20 minutes back. You're thinking that they should be back already.
Dungeon Master 00:30:00 around this time it's still reasonable for them to not be back yet but it's getting to the point where you guys would start doing the thing where you're just constantly checking over your shoulder like you know i really should hear them coming up by now it depends on if you all want to be awake i guess you can make um you could like decide to be asleep but
Kaladen Shash 00:30:12 Any moment. Is everyone awake? Are we just hanging out?
Cletus Cobbington 00:30:19 I'm just roasting some almonds.
Dungeon Master 00:30:27 You guys are just chilling. It's getting to hit just like straight up morning. It's not early morning. It's not late morning. It's just like the time that you would be up and getting ready.
Cyrus Schwert 00:30:46 because I know that... Please. Holy shit.
Cletus Cobbington 00:30:52 I'm going to interrupt you and just slap chicks opposite cheeks and an almond shoots straight down your gullet. You have no choice but to swallow it.
Dungeon Master 00:31:00 All right.
Kaladen Shash 00:31:01 look what
Leopold Magnus 00:31:02 Whoa!
Cyrus Schwert 00:31:17 Um, should we go looking for them eventually? Let me think. But they made a list. Why do you make a list if it's not going to be fast at the store?
Zariel Torgan 00:31:22 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 00:31:24 That was an everyday thing. There's no way their quick three mile times two run and pick and have would be real quick. Well, they've never been to the store, so what if they don't have it?
Kaladen Shash 00:31:24 They probably just couldn't. They're probably just waiting so long to pick the right hat. It's, like, very annoying that they went, you know, they're still looking. Like, hurry up, you know. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:31:51 Oh.
Cyrus Schwert 00:31:53 And I understand taking a long time in the woods, a long time, you know, luxuries of modern life, shopping the like, but like, you know, when we walked away to find the hats the first time we just like passed out slash in a coma while standing up for a little bit feels, you know, feels like that's a possibility.
Kaladen Shash 00:32:04 They're two silly kids, you know, are both. Yes.
Cletus Cobbington 00:32:17 would they be how far does our like
Cyrus Schwert 00:32:25 I'm just saying, I'm not telling us what to do. I don't make choices, but boy, am I frightened. I saw things. I don't think time passed, but I saw things.
Dungeon Master 00:32:34 Yeah. You haven't really tried to like push it.
Cletus Cobbington 00:32:44 are, I can't think of the word, but are like mind, beach, go.
Kaladen Shash 00:32:48 Oh, yeah. Well, I think that was only like 300, 500 feet initially, Jonathan. Is that leveling up with me or is that just staying at a real close range? Yes, let me attempt to do this.
Dungeon Master 00:33:00 You know what? You've had no reason to try to stretch out the range. You could try. Yeah. What's your primary stat? You a charisma-based guy? Intelligence. Give me an intelligence check.
Kaladen Shash 00:33:13 I concentrate, pull the mask on a little tighter, concentrate. What do I need to, is that a check you want me to roll or? Let me tell it.
Kaladen Shash 00:33:39 Oh, it's almost 18. I got a 4 plus 4, 8.
Dungeon Master 00:33:45 Hey, you are trying to sort of reach out telepathically and you don't really find any resistance, but you're like, when you try to reach out, you don't like instantly start receiving thoughts. I would leave it up to you on whether or not you tried to like to deliver a message into the ether or do you want to try to make sure you have a more solid connection?
Cletus Cobbington 00:33:46 Oh. Oh.
Kaladen Shash 00:34:09 No, I think we should look for them. Flower, flower ratio does not work.
Dungeon Master 00:34:17 Okay, simultaneously, Zarya and Leopold, you are walking in mid-conversation, you have this, it's like the invisible pressure you feel right before, like, tinnitus sets in that I described before. It's like you're about to have the onset of ringing, and you can tell, and then you sort of can't hear anything, and you find that
Cletus Cobbington 00:34:17 Well.
Cyrus Schwert 00:34:18 Wow, that's cute.
Dungeon Master 00:34:47 Not forcing you, but you feel a wave wash over you. And you get just like this strong compulsion to go a certain direction. And it's not optional, but it's not hostile necessarily. And so the two of you sort of at this like fast jog have hit the Elarian district outskirts at this point. Like you're pretty close to the party.
Dungeon Master 00:35:14 And you sort of go from your jog to a fast walk and then you hit just like into your stride of a walk. And then you're just walking and then you guys kind of teeter off and go off path and start walking into the brush. And that's when we go back to the main party saying, I think we should go after them.
Leopold Magnus 00:35:35 Oh, Zariel, don't you suppose we should maybe take a little pit stop over there? I got something resonating in my gears a little bit. I don't know. I think it might be a good idea. Oh, Zariel, you're really not yourself lately.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:49 Yeah, that sounds good. When I'm charmed, I don't have an accent. Let's head that way. It's the hat. We can't do anything, can we? Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 00:35:55 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:35:58 No.
Cletus Cobbington 00:36:00 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:36:04 I don't know if I like this whole new... you, to be honest.
Dungeon Master 00:36:09 No. Sorry. We already sort of transitioned away from you, but I wanted you to have the moment if you wanted it. This is back to the main party at the campfire. They have just said, I think we should go look for them. That is what you guys are doing at the same time, though.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:25 Oh, gotcha.
Cletus Cobbington 00:36:37 Did they have to go fully underwater? Like they were like fully submerged when they were walking? Okay. Right. Gotcha. Well, I could turn into a shark or my handy dandy octopus and get over there and see if I can find them real quick.
Dungeon Master 00:36:43 Yes, at one point when they were at the shopping district, they were underwater. But it is canon that the two of them are so heavy that they just sink to the bottom.
Leopold Magnus 00:36:48 We will.
Kaladen Shash 00:37:08 I think they've walked all the way out of the water, right? They were on the staircase climbing, or were they? Yeah, right? We just need to start. Right, right. Yeah. We just need to pack up. We just need to pack up the tree and go down the same staircase we think they ran down.
Dungeon Master 00:37:14 You don't know where they made it to, but out of character, they are in the same district as you. Trace reaches into the core of the tree. His hand just goes through the bark. He makes his fist around it. He lifts the staff up, and the whole tree collapses inside with everything in it.
Cletus Cobbington 00:37:21 I'll lift the staff it's really loud everything clatters around pants are falling
Zariel Torgan 00:37:24 They might be able to see the drips.
Kaladen Shash 00:37:41 No.
Dungeon Master 00:37:49 I feel like shit's breaking and like the tree branches are all snapping at the same time. But it's on a loop. Transformer sounds for like 30 seconds straight. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:37:55 Think of like Transformers, like the gears all transforming, but it's very wooded. All right. Let's go get these hat-wearing bastards. Shall we march on the way?
Cyrus Schwert 00:38:22 Hello? Leopold? Ariel?
Dungeon Master 00:38:27 Yeah, where are you guys going? Yes.
Kaladen Shash 00:38:30 Yeah. Yeah. Wow.
Cletus Cobbington 00:38:30 I mean, feasibly, we know the direction that they headed. I mean, should we head that direction and just keep calling out on our man speech? Do we have a word for that? The mental link, is that what it is?
Leopold Magnus 00:38:53 I think Zariel and I are starting to argue a little bit about something kind of silly. I can't quite hear that.
Zariel Torgan 00:38:53 Daryl.
Cyrus Schwert 00:38:57 Whoa.
Dungeon Master 00:39:01 So you guys had done the path. I will say...
Cletus Cobbington 00:39:16 Yeah. Oh, shoot.
Kaladen Shash 00:39:17 Man. All that for today. Still better than average.
Dungeon Master 00:39:23 um high perception check to catch anything but give me a group perception check so the three of you and we'll just average it 15 10 well
Leopold Magnus 00:39:49 Oh, that's pretty low. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you said, yeah, my apologies.
Cyrus Schwert 00:39:53 That's okay.
Dungeon Master 00:39:55 Now we're looking at like a 12 average. You guys living his life. You guys don't catch them. So sort of what you don't see is if you're looking at the map, this whole party down here is like running up this way and heading down the path not known to them.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:58 Ew, why did you roll?
Kaladen Shash 00:40:00 Yep.
Dungeon Master 00:40:24 That's technically the wrong person. Let me switch up Cletus. As you guys leave the area, sort of coming along the sort of edge, just slowly walking in silence, are the two automatons, except they take a slight detour. They go to an area that you weren't heading, and it's like you descend into this
Dungeon Master 00:40:50 sort of amphitheater area where it's like a bunch of rows of seats that kind of descend into a space. And the two of you walk into... So you...
Cletus Cobbington 00:41:15 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:41:17 after everything is like you pass so like but what you don't see behind you are the risen sort of stairs and you get the sense that this is some sort of like
Dungeon Master 00:41:27 communal center gathering, maybe plays, public speeches, things like that. There's like a little stage area tucked up in the steps and like this beautiful sort of well that disappears deep into something else. Lots of natural foliage, but you step into this space and the sort of the compulsion that you felt to
Cletus Cobbington 00:41:47 you
Dungeon Master 00:41:53 come to a certain place that's a lot of comes in my sentence there but you will halt in that spot and i caught it though i was gonna keep going um you end up pausing uh and you don't currently have another command
Leopold Magnus 00:41:57 Really into that.
Dungeon Master 00:42:11 you do still feel the sensation of having like that wave wash over you you're like you feel like there's just something sort of resonating around you still under the sort of effect so to speak but like if you wanted to have a small chat or if you wanted to try to do something to see what freedom you have you could as we're sort of just jumping back and forth between the groups
Leopold Magnus 00:42:39 I kind of pause and turn to Zariel. Oh, Zariel, I was so tied up in your new antics and that hat, I lost track of where we were going. Do you know where we're at?
Zariel Torgan 00:42:50 I'm not quite sure. I will take this opportunity to look myself in the reflection. Check out my hat. Let's see if I can see what I look like with and without it. Can I do that? Did we get... Yeah. I'm off.
Dungeon Master 00:43:04 Yeah. You look pretty dashing with the hat, but it's kind of just douchey looking as well. It's really ostentatious. As it like dried out, it just got like really sort of just like the color is like a burgundy and it's got like a lightly rimmed corner to like the whole thing. The feather is kind of as it dries like purplish iridescent and it's got like little gems bedazzled on various spots.
Leopold Magnus 00:43:28 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:43:33 Certainly.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:34 Nice. Yeah. So instead of like a fuckboy, I'm like a fuckbot. Just look really, really, really fucking douchey. Well, it could be... Oh, just a little. Okay. Do we get... I mean, us and our normal characters, we would be like really freaked out that we're away from the party and we would try to reach them. Is there any of that
Dungeon Master 00:43:34 But when you put it on, like, damn, you look good. Yeah. Not really fucking douchey, just, like, a little douchey.
Cletus Cobbington 00:43:41 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 00:44:02 here, do I get that at all? So I want to try to reach them, but I don't know if in the mindset that I'm in that I would be able to do something like that. Is it kind of like my conscious being is like, I really need to do this, but like, oh, maybe there's something more important, or can I try? That's my question, because I know I might break what you're trying to do.
Dungeon Master 00:44:04 There's a little bit of anxiety in the back of your head, but there's a forced neutrality that you're feeling.
Cletus Cobbington 00:44:26 you
Zariel Torgan 00:44:35 Because if it's like charm, I don't know. What are you thinking? Okay, just to check. Okay. 17?
Dungeon Master 00:44:37 You are dominated by definition. I'm just trying to see if there's anything that grants you a save. Give me a wisdom check. That's like along the save you'd have to make. Just a check. 17. You...
Dungeon Master 00:45:09 You can't say anything. You let go to try to reach out. And you can feel that you are being forcefully sated into standing here and not panicking or doing anything. But in your effort, as the party's sort of walking down the path, unknowingly going the wrong way, Kaladin, you feel the connection like...
Zariel Torgan 00:45:14 Mm hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:45:33 pressurized it's like a weird way to describe it but you are walking with the party you had had it in your head you're like i need to see if the connection's there and you couldn't super tell with what zariel just did you can tell that the connection is alive they're just not saying anything
Kaladen Shash 00:45:53 That's great. That pressure doesn't give me any directional sense as we were walking by. I just think, oh, I could feel a presence. Okay. That's all right. Let me just continue to try to talk to them on the comms because we think we're just walking to where they went.
Dungeon Master 00:46:04 No. Now the party is of just the area. Yeah. I mean, you guys have the map. What are you looking for specifically?
Leopold Magnus 00:46:15 And did I have the map? Yeah. Just wondering if I mean, we don't really, we don't really pay attention to how we got here. So presumably, we're pretty turned around, don't really have good bearings as to where we are, right?
Kaladen Shash 00:46:23 You can see the tiger. You're just like, wait, why are we over here?
Cletus Cobbington 00:46:35 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:46:37 I mean, you know that you walked along the edge and you ended up somewhere in sort of these trees over here. Yeah, you know you're in the same district. You know you're kind of relatively close to the camp. You guys just like walked along an inconspicuous path where you would be sort of hidden to get to here. It's not an easy to find place.
Leopold Magnus 00:46:44 Okay, so it's okay, we're not totally lost. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:47:07 We all have our mental link via a plant, right? Then are we back to our party, our half of the group? I would love to stamp my staff a couple of times and cast Locate Plants. And I think of the special flowers that we all have.
Kaladen Shash 00:47:12 A flower. Yeah, you guys have like a straw, wheat, something. That's rad.
Dungeon Master 00:47:13 if you would like to be I love that um
Zariel Torgan 00:47:37 Smart.
Leopold Magnus 00:47:39 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:47:42 Yeah, that's really cool. Kaladin sort of pauses and he relays to you that, no, I can feel that they're back. They're in connection. Cletus sort of like, it hits and it sort of resonates into the ground and you hear a deep sound instead of like the shallow clack of wood against stone. It like thrums as it hits each time and it seems like the thrum sort of expands farther and farther. And Cletus, you see,
Cletus Cobbington 00:47:43 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:48:12 almost like a spell in a video game that gives you like, you can detect a life through walls and stuff. You see these like faint glowing sort of auras through a tree line, giving you essentially like a clairvoyant type path, a direct line to them. And you can guide the party directly to them if you'd like to.
Cletus Cobbington 00:48:31 I point at them like those pointer dogs, the hunting dogs. There! And I start running, but I'm not very fast, so... I'm hoofing it. Clacking on the cobblestone.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:36 What's the paw? Hoofing. You're hoofing it.
Dungeon Master 00:48:44 Great. Back to the other group. As you guys...
Kaladen Shash 00:48:45 Loping.
Zariel Torgan 00:48:51 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:49:12 are standing in this space just sort of like idly waiting you see for the first time allowing you to see it this horrific creature it is like as it it's weird it's almost like it was always in front of you but like it's just you couldn't
Dungeon Master 00:49:39 picture that it was there it was just like you could not conceptualize its existence and it's sort of like your brain is finally allowed to see it and so it just is there in a moment and it's got this long sort of scaly black tail it's thick body um like a like a funnel shaped serpent like it's it goes really thin at the table and then widens out it's got two stocky sort of legs
Dungeon Master 00:50:10 that sit underneath a large body, a torso that comes up and splits off into like five separate heads.
Dungeon Master 00:50:18 on long necks in each head is like a frozen stone in position expression but like this elongated horrific elven face and um a rough thing that you see would be something like that it's not quite as gross as this thing generated it to be
Leopold Magnus 00:50:47 Oh, yeah, that's pretty spooky. A lot of heads like that.
Dungeon Master 00:50:48 But you see, yeah, it's not like that horror scene. It's just gross looking. It's like a worm that's a fleshy worm snake thing. It's gross, but it's not like it's going to steal your soul. Yeah, a lot of heads. And again, they're very elven in root. They look like they are warped elven figures that are like mutated into the single creature.
Zariel Torgan 00:50:48 Wow.
Cletus Cobbington 00:51:01 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:51:11 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:51:17 and as they sort of are slithering and looking at you you see that um there was this one of the heads had been singing a song and the mouth shuts and all of a sudden that sort of pressure in your ear that sort of drove you to do something sort of halts and you feel a lot of clarity that you didn't realize was being obfuscated but you still are dominated as this creature
Leopold Magnus 00:51:22 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:51:45 is coming at you sort of slowly it understands it's got the intelligence to register that you can't do anything right now so it is not threatened but simultaneously this party your friends and the direction that they were coming
Kaladen Shash 00:51:45 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:52:02 Again, we're coming out. But you guys come over the top of the ledge of this amphitheater. So you are like 70 feet in the air, but you're behind this creature. And so you see this like grotesque Hydra-esque monster sort of walking towards the party. And all of the heads are on the two figures. The three of you are unnoticed in this moment. You will get a surprise round, but you see...
Cletus Cobbington 00:52:07 Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:52:28 In this moment, you're looking down that your two friends are just standing there similar to how you had seen Cyrus and surreal before. You do see that they have some hats on. Did you don't go ahead and describe your updated character? You know, what is the hat looks like? As he's talking to somebody.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:38 Except now, we've got sweet hats. So, that's relevant.
Kaladen Shash 00:52:41 I'm going to cast a spell. I'm going to sculpt Fireball.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:46 Oh, sorry.
Dungeon Master 00:52:57 What would you guys like to do? Okay, so your action would be to cast a spell. What are you casting? Knife. Fireball's a 30-foot AoE. All right.
Cletus Cobbington 00:53:09 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:53:11 Aim it at this monstrosity. 20. If you click on the spells themselves, like if I click on it, it should drop one. I think you just see it. Oh, there we go. Oh, just hit that shit.
Dungeon Master 00:53:29 You wouldn't necessarily need to sculpt it. You could just hit that shit. Okay. That'll be your action. What does everybody else want to do? So Kaladin is going to kick this off.
Cyrus Schwert 00:53:41 Hello.
Cletus Cobbington 00:53:54 I think I'm just going to go straight into a moonbeam when it's turned. So I don't think I have any prepared action.
Dungeon Master 00:54:11 Okay. A fireball and move bead will go off at the same time. Does anybody else want to do something? Okay. And then, okay. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 00:54:13 Yeah. I'll just cast three strike on the fucked up looking thing. That's it.
Cletus Cobbington 00:54:30 Awesome.
Dungeon Master 00:54:32 So then we'll go ahead and roll initiative. Everybody can roll initiative, even the two of you who are dominated. And then we'll have that go off before anything. And let me get just music for this. Which one?
Zariel Torgan 00:54:48 Is this based at all off of the One Punch Man monster? Or is that just a totally different thing? Coincidence. And that big alien ship comes down and then the one dude with like all the different heads pops out and they all got different voices.
Cletus Cobbington 00:55:00 All right.
Dungeon Master 00:55:05 No. If you are at all familiar with it, it is based on... It is essentially a false Hydra in D&D, which is like a weird, fleshy abomination instead. And it's got this really unique ability in any creature in D&D where it's got a mind song where if you can hear it within a range, it can...
Kaladen Shash 00:55:28 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:55:31 force you to not interpret its existence. You just don't see it. So you could, like, trip over it and not realize that you tripped over anything. And then, so you can't really save against its spells. It could, in theory, like, pick you up once it's dominated you. And as long as one of the heads is singing, it could just carry you away and eat you and nobody would know. It could, like, make people forget that you existed kind of deal. So it's really...
Zariel Torgan 00:55:40 Wow. Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:55:59 gross and like i don't know i've always wanted to use one that's like how do i how do i do this
Leopold Magnus 00:56:06 That's cool.
Zariel Torgan 00:56:08 You guys also noticed, looking over the edge, that I'm still holding the makeshift bucket hat for Cyrus that I've been trying to just curl and rip into place, make it nice. Just giving it a little shake so they all kind of like, ding, ding.
Cyrus Schwert 00:56:17 It's got balls. Perfect.
Dungeon Master 00:56:34 Okay. Let's kick this off. Surprise round. Go ahead and roll your Fireball and Moonbeam, and we'll do it as one giant hit of damage because on initiative 19, this creature will go first.
Kaladen Shash 00:56:51 I got a 26 for the fireball damage. It's a dex, yeah. I'm hoping not.
Cletus Cobbington 00:57:03 Would they need to still roll their save? OK. Then I have a con save for me.
Dungeon Master 00:57:11 I mean, I don't think it's super dexterous. Is it also a dex for con save? OK. First will be the dex save. Next will be the con save. 9 on the dex save. And it got a 26 on the con save.
Kaladen Shash 00:57:30 The bill.
Cyrus Schwert 00:57:31 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:57:38 That's a fail. No. Get half her damage. Oh, I really did not. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:57:41 Oh, yeah. Me? I have Hydra, Monstrosity, Kaladin, Cyrus, Cletus, Sariel, Leopold.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:43 New World initiative yet? Latest. Oh. I'm just not seeing it on there for some reason. My thing hasn't updated. All right. I just refreshed it. Mine was not up to date. There it is. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:58:05 Yep.
Cyrus Schwert 00:58:14 You guys fucking built Care Bear stairs. Monster.
Cletus Cobbington 00:58:19 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:21 We're just like super chill.
Dungeon Master 00:58:21 OK, so how much total damage? It takes 26 fireball, and then a half of 19. It takes 9, 10.
Dungeon Master 00:58:43 But 9.5, yeah, it takes 9. OK. Big hit. Kaladin sticks his hand out. Cletus sticks his hand up, and you see this little red beam shoot forward and this bright yellow gold beam shoot down at the exact same time, just like this massive impact explosion on this creature as everything kicks off into initiative. First and foremost.
Dungeon Master 00:59:12 at the start of its turn, I'm going to need everybody to give me, because you are now in combat with it, give me a wisdom saving throw.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:22 Bye.
Cyrus Schwert 00:59:25 Oh, I'm not good at that. Please.
Dungeon Master 00:59:43 Okay. 27, 19, and 23 pass. Five fails. The three of you see that one of the heads starts wailing, this horrific scream that induces this ringing. It almost makes you bend down to a knee. It's so intense. The only one who doesn't seem infected is
Cletus Cobbington 01:00:00 And.
Dungeon Master 01:00:07 Cyrus, as from his perspective, and this is the description, on a failure, you are unable to perceive the Hydra and you forget about it. So Cyrus goes from being in combat and he's so ready to get into this fight. And then you see he just kind of like, like completely forgets what he's doing. He like doesn't register that he's in a fight.
Cyrus Schwert 01:00:19 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:00:32 Until his turn, and then he'll have to, like, do something right then. But he is not moving. And then as its actual turn, it will move forward. And looking at both of you, you both don't look super appetizing, but I think in the moment of distress, Zariel being the smaller target, it's going to try to, like, snatch you up real quick. So give... Oh, I didn't... I promise...
Cletus Cobbington 01:00:48 So scrumptious and swaggy.
Cyrus Schwert 01:00:56 That Hashtag snack behavior.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:58 Yeah. The hat makes me a snack. Is the... What's the condition that Cyrus is under? What is it called specifically? Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:01:07 He's not under a condition right now. He just, per the effect, cannot
Dungeon Master 01:01:28 perceived the creature, and he forgets about it. So he is not under any spell. He is just not actively fighting this creature. Hold on. Roll 2d20. Try to make it do the advantage. Keep highest.
Zariel Torgan 01:01:30 Gotcha. Gotcha. All right. Gotcha.
Cletus Cobbington 01:01:31 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:02:06 No, it didn't work. Oh, it's so embarrassing. I didn't change anything. OK. I did it. Don't worry. I just didn't put a space between the slash r. 17 plus 12, 29, didn't it? Sorry, y'all.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:14 No, no, no. So put the key highest. No, no, no. At the end of the 12. Yeah, there you go. Oh, he's typing it wrong? Here you go. Silly.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:17 What happened?
Zariel Torgan 01:02:34 Does this affect my dominate, or am I still dominated?
Dungeon Master 01:02:37 OK, you take 20 points of piercing damage and you are grappled. When you take damage,
Cletus Cobbington 01:02:39 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:02:41 you
Dungeon Master 01:03:08 This, hold on, let me get the dominate. It's a great question. Well, you would have, but I didn't do it. So I'll give you, go ahead and give me a, do another wisdom saving throw and do it with advantage.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:13 Oh, and does hitting it make it have to re-roll to maintain any concentration, or is that just like a totally different thing, because it's like a head? I'm looking for anything here. Alright. Seventeen.
Dungeon Master 01:03:45 17 does not pass. Hold on. I got to do it. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. There are six heads on this creature. And then it makes an attack for every head. So it's actually going to also attack Leopold.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:47 Alright.
Cyrus Schwert 01:04:12 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:04:16 Oh, dear. That will not hit. I think I read it. Yeah, it's not hit. With some save with advantage. Come on. 15. Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:04:19 21 to hit. OK. Since it attacked you, go ahead and give me the wisdom save with advantage. We're two attacks in. Fail. Still dominated. It'll roll to attack you again. This is attack three.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:28 Come on, you got it. Oof.
Cletus Cobbington 01:04:29 No.
Leopold Magnus 01:04:47 Wow. Can I shield? Or since I don't know I'm being attacked, can I do anything about it? Okay. Yep, that hits.
Dungeon Master 01:04:49 24 to hit. No, since you're still dominated, you can't react in a way that counters it. Okay, so you take... You take 26 points of piercing damage and you are grappled.
Dungeon Master 01:05:19 Attack four will be against... Go ahead and roll me another wisdom save for the advantage, because it did damage to you. It'll attack Jesse again, who's still dominated. That's a 30 to hit, Jesse. You are engulfed. It swallows you.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:19 That's tough. Oh, man.
Zariel Torgan 01:05:31 Just barely. Sweet. You're like, mm, isn't that nice of you? Can I try again? Come on, you fucker. 24.
Cyrus Schwert 01:05:44 I'm just sitting there whistling.
Dungeon Master 01:05:53 Yes, go ahead and give me another wisdom save with advantage. 24, you pass. You are no longer dominated as you regain your senses.
Dungeon Master 01:06:05 And as you are sliding down this gullet that gives the faint bit of light through the thin, fleshy sections of its throat, as you tumble into the slime, we'll address it next. And then its last attack, attack five, because the sixth head is singing the song, will be against Leopold. It's going to try to swallow you as well. Leopold, did you save on the wisdom save? 29 to hit. I did.
Zariel Torgan 01:06:10 Nice. You roll the advantage on that they fold. OK.
Dungeon Master 01:06:37 Oh, no. Leopold, did you roll with advantage? He did, yeah. Leopold, you are also engulfed. After that, it is Aladin's turn. Oh, yeah. Now that you are engulfed, you can roll again.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:43 Sorry, I was getting water in the bathroom. Yeah, I did whirl with advantage and I rolled a nine. Fantastic. Things couldn't be going better. Oh, because I got engulfed? Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:06:59 But roll again with advantage, Leo. Wait, did I take any advantage, any damage from getting swallowed? Okay. It's fucked. An 18, I think.
Kaladen Shash 01:07:00 I'm like, no.
Cletus Cobbington 01:07:02 Real quick.
Dungeon Master 01:07:06 Yes. Question completed. No, on the Egolf, no damage. 16 fail. It is an 18.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:12 16? Oh man, what is this pass? This is high. I only have a plus 1 to that dice roll. It's an 18? Bummer. Didn't the 17 fail? That's tough.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:29 I'm just guessing. Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:07:35 17 failed by one. And that's another Charisma save. Constitution save, I mean. I don't know why I got it removed from the initiative tracker.
Cletus Cobbington 01:07:43 I also just remembered it needs to roll another roll for Moonbeam since it was that start of its turn. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:07:55 Ariel's image in the middle of that monster.
Dungeon Master 01:08:08 Okay. It rolled a 14. Okay, so it would have taken full damage at the start of its turn, and then it moves out of that space. 16 more damage. Okay, so it took how much total from the fireball moonbeam the first time?
Zariel Torgan 01:08:13 Yeah, I moved it. Nice. So much.
Kaladen Shash 01:08:14 26. 26 from the fireball. I can't remember what the fireball was or the moonbeam.
Cletus Cobbington 01:08:15 So it fails. One second.
Cyrus Schwert 01:08:31 Yuck. Plus 9. 51. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:08:37 26 plus nine, 26, nine and 35 plus 16 is 51.
Kaladen Shash 01:08:43 35. Yep.
Dungeon Master 01:08:51 With that last moonbeam, Cletus, your moonbeam sears off the head that was singing as it kind of just like defensively just sort of like howls in the air. The moonbeam cuts through and like singes the head clean off and you see like the burning red of the radiant damage as that head is now removed. It is now down to five heads.
Cletus Cobbington 01:09:04 I like your friend.
Dungeon Master 01:09:27 Did both Cyrus and Kaladin get a 12-1 initiative? Okay. And Cyrus just can't do anything. Oh, well...
Cyrus Schwert 01:09:37 Holy shit.
Kaladen Shash 01:09:38 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:09:43 Its mind song ended on its turn. You see, like, you have this perception of nothing. You kind of forget what's happening. And then this creature is, like, lumbering forward. It swallows Zariel and Leopold, and then one of its head gets burned off. And you see just, like, this, like, flailing serpent head as the other two party members get swallowed. You have your turn normally. That was a great series of events.
Cyrus Schwert 01:10:07 I scream. I scream loud. Like horror movie scream. But I'm ready. Yeah. But I'm ready to rip. And I charge down the hill at this guy. Trying to get up in his business. I take my full 30 feet and I can get there. Yes. Yes.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:10 That's it.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:10 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:10:14 Like a high-pitched female voice? No.
Cyrus Schwert 01:10:36 I'm going to take a swing at him. I imagine my Hunter's Mark would have dropped. Since I forgot he existed. For a second. Sure. I was going to get the advantage the first time. 26. I'm going to charge this bitch up and smite as well. And do...
Dungeon Master 01:10:45 You were still maintaining a spell, but your brain was just being tricked. 26 hit. Do it.
Cyrus Schwert 01:11:08 I'm going to do a defensive flourish as a bonus action as well. This is the flourish. So I do five on my bonus action flourish, and my AC goes up by five. So my next turn, I'll swing again. I don't have advantage anymore.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:08 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:11:15 Nice. Okay, 32 damage. That's fine. Natural. Why? Let's go. Let's see those numbers.
Cyrus Schwert 01:11:35 But it doesn't fucking matter, baby. This puppy's getting ripped. Okay, I can't smite again. But I can... Oh, it's bonus action. It's not a spell. I would have used it the one time. Yeah, I can do the divine smite again.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:40 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:42 Oh yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:11:48 Yes, you can, unless you just don't have the spells for it. You can do divine as just anything. Yeah, you just can't do the, you know, whatever the spell was, the branding or searing.
Cyrus Schwert 01:12:08 OK. We'll do a fucking, we'll just turn the fuck up and do a fifth level smite. It shows up on my fifth level thing. OK, understood.
Cletus Cobbington 01:12:11 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:17 Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:12:18 I think it maxes at four. Do you have a four? Yeah, you can upcast it, but the max is like the bonus you get from fourth level. So if you just do a four, you're still getting the same damage. That's going to be a good hint.
Cyrus Schwert 01:12:37 Sorry, it's taking me a while to type it in. Okay, now it's rolling. Another 84. I fucking turned into white lightning and I fucked this bitch up.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:49 Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.
Dungeon Master 01:12:51 So that was, in your turn, you did 111 points of damage. Narrate how Cyrus cuts off two more heads of the Hydra. All right.
Cletus Cobbington 01:12:53 Talk.
Leopold Magnus 01:13:03 Hell yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:13:06 My whole body starts glowing with white hot light, and it extends into my sword as I fucking slice through this thing like a knife going through hot butter. I jump off the thing, and I just in one slice hit both of the heads and land in like an Iron Man pose. It's the coolest I've ever felt, for sure. I look over my shoulder to make sure everybody saw it.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:26 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 01:13:32 I'm inside this thing, right?
Dungeon Master 01:13:35 Yeah, you couldn't see it, but everybody else saw it. I'm going to say that I'm following the same rules in general that I learned for the critical roll ones. At 30 damage, it has to make a DC 25 concept and not barf. But since you did triple that,
Cyrus Schwert 01:13:55 Freaking borefoot my friends, dude.
Dungeon Master 01:13:59 I'm going to say it has to make a constitution saving throw, and on a nat 20, it keeps them down. If it fails by 10 or more, which I think only happens on a nat 1, it barfs up both of them, but regardless, it's going to barf up one of them, and you can pick who gets barfed up.
Cyrus Schwert 01:14:25 Okay, roll the dice. Okay, even Azariel out as Leopold, because I'm not deciding. Leopold comes out. Azariel's cool hat is still beaten.
Dungeon Master 01:14:30 Here we go. That is a 16. It could fail by more than 10. Hold on. Yeah. 16. It barfs up one of your companions. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:49 you chopped off the neck that I was getting digested in so I just poke out the hat shake it around
Kaladen Shash 01:14:52 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:14:52 I'm just like flailing. God, oh dear. And I just start like sloughing off that digestive material that was in the creature, just kind of flopping it on the ground at my feet. I kind of stumble around like I don't have my feet underneath me and turn to everyone else like, whoa, what are you all doing here?
Cletus Cobbington 01:14:56 he's fucking ace ventura being birthed by the rhino's ass
Cyrus Schwert 01:14:58 Don't save me, save this. You look like a newborn calf.
Dungeon Master 01:15:05 Hell of a hint.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:22 Heh Heh heh heh heh heh
Cyrus Schwert 01:15:30 No, that will do it. Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:15:34 After that, unless you got anything else on your turn, sir? Okay. Kaladin, you were up after that. 15 misses.
Kaladen Shash 01:15:45 I'm going to begin to close the distance, and as I'm sort of jumping down, I'm going to shoot one Esopter blast. 15 to hit? Nope. And then before I hit the ground as well, I'm going to go ahead and take two melee attacks with light splitter. I'm going to use the arc lash feature on it.
Cletus Cobbington 01:16:03 Oh.
Kaladen Shash 01:16:12 So that as I'm jumping and I'm within 30 feet, I'm just going to begin to attack. So first one, clearly a 29 hits. And then I can't see the second one, a 20, 30, 20. Wait, what is that?
Dungeon Master 01:16:13 29 hits. 20 hits.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:23 Nice. 30-20. Does he get advantage because Leo's flanking? Or is he in the air? Gotcha. OK, that's fair.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:42 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:16:44 At range, he doesn't get it. 30 points again. Good hit.
Kaladen Shash 01:16:52 Right, and damage, oh, pretty good. 30. I'll say I'm just, I'll say I'll just move my 30 feet through that action. Yeah, perfect.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:56 Nice. Not bad at all.
Dungeon Master 01:17:22 30 feet technically gets there. Cyrus, how much movement do you have? Yeah, you could just jump diagonally. It's just the way that I'd put you to start with.
Cyrus Schwert 01:17:29 I have 30 feet. I measured it when I dragged him over there, though. I used the luck of the draw, too. I was just kind of a little more forward.
Kaladen Shash 01:17:32 Yeah, my ruler put me. Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:17:48 Are you? Yeah. OK. Good round from that. Not quite enough to chop off another head. You see, you've made two arc lashes, and it cuts in on one and cuts in on the other. And the neck is almost there, but it doesn't quite cut off. Yes, you can.
Kaladen Shash 01:18:05 Can I take it? I'm going to go ahead and action surge just for giggles. I'll take two more attacks. 25 to hit, and then a natural one will not hit. Okay, okay.
Dungeon Master 01:18:21 No, it will not. 25 will. It says 1d10 plus 1d6. Why did you roll 103?
Kaladen Shash 01:18:31 That's not right. That is strange. 97. Oh, 1D20 plus 4. Oh, I don't know why it rolled a... Oh, because it's 1D1007? I don't know what that was. Let's do it again. Here we go. 1D... I guess I can just...
Dungeon Master 01:18:55 I think you just found a glitch in the system. That's like a bit of code that's broken. Brent, roll me a D20. Do you have one in person? Do you have a D20 next to you?
Zariel Torgan 01:19:00 crazy. Yeah, that's... Yeah, I'm not a math major, but...
Leopold Magnus 01:19:01 Just roll with it, you know? Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:19:02 It must count. Oh, I'm not right next to me tonight, but I can grab one in like two seconds. You want me to roll a d20? I will.
Cyrus Schwert 01:19:03 That's wild. I think that's just what he got, probably. I'm no math magician, but I'm pretty sure.
Dungeon Master 01:19:24 Yeah, if you roll a nat 20, you can do 103 damage. Get out of the bag and everything.
Cletus Cobbington 01:19:29 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:19:29 It's worth it. It's worth the two seconds. Go run and grab it. Please. This is incredible.
Kaladen Shash 01:19:32 Oh, yeah. There we go. Let's see where these guys go. Here we go. Okay. I love that video. It's a 13. It's a 13. There we go.
Zariel Torgan 01:19:44 Rick, the thing you just put up is awful. It's fucking horrible. Oh. Jesus, you guys.
Leopold Magnus 01:19:51 Yeah, did you see that video?
Dungeon Master 01:19:58 You do 20 points of damage. 50 total. Callan, how do you remove another head?
Cyrus Schwert 01:19:59 Bye.
Kaladen Shash 01:20:01 But 20 on the single roll is just fine, too. That is nothing to buck at. 50 damage on that run. I just keep swinging, and you see those arc lashes? These light blades are just cutting through the air. And after the first two hit, the third one just takes the last little bit of thin you that the neck was hanging off from.
Dungeon Master 01:20:33 And what are the damage types on your weapon again? Is it just radiant? Your D6 is radiant damage. Yeah. OK. Mm-hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:20:37 I think it's just slashing. Oh, it's radiant or necrotic. I usually choose radiant damage. Yep. That's only the D6, though, so that would have been just the smallest number on there. Seven. Three.
Cletus Cobbington 01:20:43 Well.
Dungeon Master 01:21:00 He doesn't have resistance or anything. It's just something I have to keep track of. Until its next turn or on its next turn?
Cyrus Schwert 01:21:06 I would like to put out there that my slasher feet means when I create with a slashing weapon, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls until its next turn. Until the start of my next turn.
Leopold Magnus 01:21:15 Oh hell yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:21:15 Yeah, that'll help on the next top of the order. Yes, that's how it should read.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:16 Oh, Jesus Christ. Nice.
Cletus Cobbington 01:21:18 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:21:28 Okay, so I just matched the advantage because you were after it. Very nice. It might not matter at this point. You guys have done 222 damage at this marker. After that, that is Cletus. You have Moonbeam up.
Cyrus Schwert 01:21:37 Yeah, I see.
Cletus Cobbington 01:21:50 Let's see. Oh, true. One is, let's see.
Dungeon Master 01:21:59 Oh, actually, I'll say that Cyrus was able to get around, but there is a moonbeam right in front of your path, Kaladin. You couldn't run on that line unless it got moved. It's that right there, where it was standing.
Kaladen Shash 01:22:09 Okay, cool, cool. Yeah, that's fine. What's the air? Is it 10 feet?
Cletus Cobbington 01:22:42 OK. Sorry, I was just reading Moonbeam. I forgot the full context of it. For sake of not having to move it through two of my party members, I'm going to dispel it. And that doesn't cost an action, does it?
Dungeon Master 01:22:43 What are you doing, Trace? Okay. Nope.
Cletus Cobbington 01:23:11 Then I'm just going to do a little finger gun and shoot my guiding bolt at it. 27. Come on. Oh, there's multiple ones. 27. I have three ones. That's why.
Dungeon Master 01:23:13 Go ahead and roll. Is it a dex aid? No, it's a hit. 27 hits. Guiding Bolt is also radiant damage. Are you mad at 27 damage?
Kaladen Shash 01:23:44 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:23:44 Okay, 27 damage on that. It is glowing, sort of bright, like it's primed to be hit one more time. After that, it is Zariel. Zariel, you are engulfed. At the start of your turn, please give me a Constitution-saving throw.
Cletus Cobbington 01:23:58 you
Zariel Torgan 01:24:10 That's going to be a seven.
Leopold Magnus 01:24:12 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:24:12 You take 2d8 plus 5 bludgeoning damage. 15 points of damage, and you are restrained and blinded.
Kaladen Shash 01:24:13 You need more from you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:24:14 She's always...
Dungeon Master 01:24:41 So if you have anything that's site-based or somatic-based, you can't do it. I'll let you make melee attack rolls with disadvantage, or if you've got some sneaky way to get out, let me know. What are you doing, though? Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 01:24:44 He's
Kaladen Shash 01:24:51 Lots of touching.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:59 Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not going to try to get out. This was actually my game plan to get eaten. I'm going to turn into a fire elemental. And all the attacks are just touch base. So I'm just touching. So I don't have to even hit. Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:25:12 Nice. Nice.
Leopold Magnus 01:25:17 Ooh, sizzling.
Cyrus Schwert 01:25:20 He's got the thing as objects and bubblegum.
Kaladen Shash 01:25:22 Good luck making that deck save.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:28 So, yeah, I'm going to erupt into flames, and I'd like to make my attacks. Do you still want me to roll for him just because, I mean, what do you want me to do? Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:25:42 Yes, because it'll be less about you making contact and more of you getting purchased. It's got a lot of slime in there and stuff. Maybe some things don't quite get through, but all of your attacks will be with advantage. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:56 Alright, so just being in my vicinity, it takes 1d10, so I'll roll that. And then it's going to be... Let's get this going here. 15 to hit.
Cyrus Schwert 01:26:00 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:26:19 15 misses. 15 misses. Six points of fire damage. But you're in there.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:26 And 15 for a second time. Not as intense as I was hoping for. But I'm in there.
Cyrus Schwert 01:26:33 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:26:46 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:26:49 It's going to keep you down there for now just because that wasn't a ton of damage. But this is a pretty good idea. You could get out this way. This is not a bad idea that you've done. It just didn't pay off yet. After that, it is Leopold's turn.
Leopold Magnus 01:27:07 Oh, dear. Oh, oh, my. Am I undominated, like, after being vomited, or am I still dominated? No. Okay. So I'm, like, finally seeing this creature in front of me and completely horrified, and I, like, turn over to Zariel. Or, no, Zariel's not even out yet. Turn over to
Zariel Torgan 01:27:16 I think that head died, didn't it?
Dungeon Master 01:27:17 You haven't passed yet, have you? Oh, it's taken so much damage. There's no way I would have passed the check. You are done. No.
Cyrus Schwert 01:27:17 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:27:35 Cyrus. Oh, God. Oh, the inside of that thing was completely awful. And then I'll kind of reach down to my belt and I'll withdraw my searing saber just kind of slowly. And I'll say, stand back, foul creature. And I'll lunge forward and slash at one of its remaining heads. 21 to hit.
Dungeon Master 01:27:55 Roll the hit. 21 hits. 20 hits.
Cyrus Schwert 01:28:06 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:08 Okay, so that's one that hits. 20 to hit. Oh, nice. Okay. So then that's 8 on one of the slashes, 11 on the second, and then the fire damage, an additional 3. So 22 points of damage on the two slices.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:08 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:38 And then as a bonus action, I will call forward Bone Crusher and I'll tell Bone Crusher, Take the flank! We can do it together! I don't know. I think maybe just axe on the next one. Takes him a second to get in place.
Dungeon Master 01:28:39 All right, and does he act on the first turn? Does he act on the next one? I always forget. Okay, can I get on a different thing?
Cyrus Schwert 01:28:41 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:29:08 Copy, paste, bone pressure. And you always put them on the other side for flank. Beautiful. Top of the round with two heads left, having taken both fire
Leopold Magnus 01:29:14 Yes.
Kaladen Shash 01:29:18 Ooh.
Dungeon Master 01:29:38 and radiant damage in the same round, you see it goes to regenerate its heads and it can't do it. Smoke starts rising out of the little throat slits that lead into its stomach as there is now a fire elemental burning with an infernal fury in its stomach. Does it do... I don't even know if it regains health points and it's got...
Zariel Torgan 01:30:06 It also takes another d10 on the start of its turn if it doesn't leave my vicinity.
Dungeon Master 01:30:12 Mm-hmm. We'll just roll that. It's not going to get rid of you just yet. No, since it doesn't grow heads, it doesn't heal. I don't think it's going to make another round. It takes another two damage. Nice, even number. It is going to... Jeez, it's in a desperate spot with... It is going to use Dreadful Scream. I need...
Dungeon Master 01:30:39 Every creature within a 60 foot radius. Give me a constitution saving throw.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:51 Oh dear. I've got... Yeah, that's not bad. That'll do. I did. Yep.
Zariel Torgan 01:30:54 Oh, hang on, I used the wrong stat. There we go. Ouch.
Cletus Cobbington 01:31:00 Same.
Dungeon Master 01:31:11 Who rolled 20 or higher? One of you? Okay. Leopold, you take 19 points of psychic damage. I think there's a resistance with Cyrus, though. Anybody who did not succeed take 38 points of psychic damage. And you are stunned until the end of its next turn.
Kaladen Shash 01:31:18 Oh, 19 missed it. Oh, oh.
Leopold Magnus 01:31:27 Ooh. He does. Even if you saved? Got it. How many heads are left? Two, okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:31:43 Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:31:46 No, if you saved, you're fine. Those who failed. Two. Which is important because the second head is not going to attack. It is going to use its mind song. Everybody that can hear, give me a wisdom saving throw with advantage. Oh, I'm sorry, not with advantage. You just get to make the check. It is just a wisdom save.
Leopold Magnus 01:32:01 Oh, fuck. What? Jesus.
Zariel Torgan 01:32:12 Well, the first one I rolled was the four coin. Yeah, mine was the higher one anyway.
Dungeon Master 01:32:13 If you rolled with advantage, just take the first one it lists. 18, 17, 9. Wait a minute. There's a lot there. It wasn't saved. OK. Zariel passed. Cleetus passed. Leopold failed.
Dungeon Master 01:32:39 Caledon belts Cyrus past. Okay. So Leopold and Caledon, it ceases to exist for you as it erases it from your memory. You currently are not active in initiative. Cyrus saved. It is going to
Zariel Torgan 01:32:52 mile.
Cyrus Schwert 01:32:57 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:32:57 Picking me for a ride. Oh, would it get an attack of opportunity? Bone Crusher? Yeah, that's fair.
Dungeon Master 01:33:06 not incredibly hurt, but it's going to start trying to escape. It'll take one attack of opportunity from Cyrus, but it steps past Bone Crusher and Leopold without issue. No, because Bone Crusher acts on your will, and if it doesn't exist to you, he's not going to attack it. And Zardo, you go with by extension.
Cyrus Schwert 01:33:32 18. It's on the way out.
Cletus Cobbington 01:33:32 Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:33:37 18 hits. It moves 60 feet. 30 feet. It can't dash. It's 30 feet away from you guys. 19 points of damage. It's actually looking pretty good.
Cletus Cobbington 01:34:04 Oh.
Cyrus Schwert 01:34:04 Sorry, it's still inside of it. Nice. Oh, we're in business. I'm chasing this fucker. Oh wait, I'm stunned. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:34:07 Yes. Okay. And at the end of that, it is actually just your turn, Cyrus. It is 30 feet away from you. You are stunned. Oh, you couldn't attack it because it did not take that damage.
Kaladen Shash 01:34:31 Yeah. I'm also stunned.
Cletus Cobbington 01:34:34 all right
Cyrus Schwert 01:34:34 Yeah, I couldn't have done that. I got a nav one on that check or save, so can't get away with that. It's supposed to be there.
Dungeon Master 01:34:39 yeah that's my bad too I forgot okay it's just going to be your turn you are stunned and you are stunned until the end of its next turn so it's just nothing Kaladin you don't exist to it I mean sorry it doesn't exist to you it thinks really bad about you plus you're also stunned Cletus did you save
Zariel Torgan 01:35:05 It's.
Cyrus Schwert 01:35:07 The wisdom one? Yeah, it did.
Cletus Cobbington 01:35:10 Uh, yeah. Or did I roll? Oh, yeah. Yeah, it is. Indeed. Ooh. I mean, I still have range stuff. I think my bolt has 120 feet.
Dungeon Master 01:35:12 Okay. From the original one, from the MindFong. Yeah, you got a 23. So you see it get away. You are currently 95 feet away from it.
Cletus Cobbington 01:35:38 Yes. Well, let me hop down and do my 30. Oh, shit. Did I get slower? I have 20 feet of movement. Was that because of my heavy armor? Tragic. So I really am just clickety clacking, hoofing it. OK, I'm going to jump down really heroically, but I really didn't get very far.
Dungeon Master 01:35:52 I think it's because you're heavy armor.
Cyrus Schwert 01:35:52 It takes you a long time.
Cletus Cobbington 01:36:06 And I fall really fast because I'm heavy, but I didn't go far. And then I'll do my finger gun and try to look a little cooler, even though it's still a little shooting with my little bolt. Oh, fuck. I really had to say I wanted to look cool, didn't I?
Kaladen Shash 01:36:11 I hope.
Dungeon Master 01:36:31 That one misses. You jump down and I'm ignoring the height because I think it makes it way more cool. But you drop like 70 feet and you roll your ankle really badly. And then you're like, go shoot me. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Has anybody attacked it since you attacked it last? Yeah, it would have been Leopold.
Zariel Torgan 01:36:32 Oh no.
Cyrus Schwert 01:36:36 To.
Cletus Cobbington 01:36:48 I'm at a knee and I try to still shoot. It does not work. Fuck.
Dungeon Master 01:37:00 Yeah, Leopold would have taken an attack. Rex, one of your attacks would have had advantage. I don't know if we gave you advantage on that, because it had taken the guiding bolt previously, too. Okay, you still get that. We're not going to have a real one, and that's funny enough.
Leopold Magnus 01:37:10 Oh, I hit, but I didn't roll those with advantage. I guess I could roll... Yeah, I mean, yeah, I was going to say I could get a nat 20. Okay. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:37:17 No, I don't.
Cletus Cobbington 01:37:21 Oh, shit. I honestly don't even know. Fuck. Fuck, forget about the thing. Help my ankle.
Dungeon Master 01:37:22 Just remember going forward. After Cletus' turn, his ankle is kind of turning purple. It is Zaryl, you are in its belly. It takes the D10 of fire damage at the beginning. It takes your attacks with advantage. Give me the con saving throw at the start of your turn.
Leopold Magnus 01:37:49 Oh, oh, Kalidus, oh. I'm aware of the people around me, right? I just don't know the creature exists. Yeah, oh, oh, Kalidus, you shouldn't be rushing so fast. You might hurt yourself more further.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:50 All right.
Cyrus Schwert 01:37:50 Dario can fend for himself. He'll be fine. I'm wrapping up. I'm good at healing other people. Not myself.
Cletus Cobbington 01:37:55 I'm definitely not a healer. I don't know if you saw but it was actually really slow.
Dungeon Master 01:37:57 Yeah, you can't see it. It's weird what they're doing. Sorry, did you give me con save to take that crushing damage or not?
Zariel Torgan 01:38:18 So did you say roll my ? OK. Jesus. All right. And then does he take the fire damage still?
Cletus Cobbington 01:38:25 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:38:30 22 fails. You take 16 points of bludgeoning damage. It's a DC 25. Yep, you get the automatic D10 plus your attacks have advantage. Six points of fire damage.
Cyrus Schwert 01:38:39 wow you
Zariel Torgan 01:38:50 Alright. Let me adjust my damage for my... I'll just attack real quick. 19. Oh! Hell yeah, it does. And then that's a 1 and a 2.
Dungeon Master 01:39:10 19 hits. 8 misses. Balance is out.
Cyrus Schwert 01:39:20 Jeez.
Leopold Magnus 01:39:20 No.
Zariel Torgan 01:39:21 I'll take what I can get. Let me just add in my damage before I forget. I don't want to forget and not take it. All right, so that's going to be... And with actually connecting, does he catch on fire too? Or is it inside so it's wet?
Cletus Cobbington 01:39:32 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:39:45 as on fire. Yeah, it catches on fire. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:39:51 It looks like Greasy Boy. All right, so it's going to take an additional 1d10 now on its turn. So on its turn, a d10. On my turn, a d10. Then I have a fly speed. I'd like to attempt, and you can tell me this won't work because it might. I'd like to fly back towards the group.
Cletus Cobbington 01:40:18 And turn.
Dungeon Master 01:40:20 Mm-hmm. You are restrained, so your movement is zero. I would agree normally, but I think being swallowed sort of is different than being, like, rear-choked.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:22 while inside of him. I don't think I can be restrained as a fire elemental. Yeah. Yeah, I guess my thought was like, you know, I was hoping to like just like drag him back, you know,
Kaladen Shash 01:40:32 It just starts floating. Yeah. Just prevent his progress.
Leopold Magnus 01:40:34 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:40:49 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:40:51 We can do an opposed strength check, like a contest strength. But in my mind, you are this malleable form. And if you were a humanoid, the stomach would be pressing you into a humanoid shape. Because you're a ball of fire, the stomach has sort of got you compressed down a little bit. It's asking a lot to be like, I would like to move this large monstrosity. But I'll let you do an opposed strength.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:52 Because, like, I can't, like, you know. Okay. Hmm. Yeah. My strength is very low, so it'll be funny.
Cletus Cobbington 01:40:55 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:41:15 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:41:23 It has a plus 11 to strength checks. It's got a proficiency. And on that one... It is almost on that one. It's a 15, though. You make a little bit of movement in some bowel gas releases, and it's already on fire on the inside, but you see it burst and catch its flame, but
Zariel Torgan 01:41:23 That's a five. Okay, so it can't miss. Now it's zero for the elemental. It's just a flame. The wispy flame. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:41:28 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:41:31 You don't even have a modifier? Oh, yeah. That makes sense, I guess.
Cletus Cobbington 01:41:45 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:41:54 No real effort on there. Image. After that, Leopold. Yeah, and then on Leopold's turn. Leopold, you have no idea what he's talking about. He cannot visualize this creature in any way, shape, or form. You don't
Zariel Torgan 01:41:56 Yeah, I'll come through the mental link and I'm like, don't worry guys, I'm roasting this guy like a turkey. Does he see the smoke? Wild.
Leopold Magnus 01:42:07 From the inside out, Zario, what the hell are you talking about? I don't know. So what I...
Cletus Cobbington 01:42:16 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:42:19 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:42:24 He can't figure out where you are. There's like a break in his mental synapses that prevents him from doing anything helpful right now. You can see him instead. No, not quite.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:35 Oh, that's funny. I was hoping he would just see me struggling. He's like, what are you doing? Yeah, just up in the air, just like... It makes sense, though. Yeah. Oh, like a concentration check, you mean?
Leopold Magnus 01:42:40 Just floating in midair. I can't see the creature at all, but he's just completely transparent. Well, I guess I would make a wisdom save. What if it had to make a wisdom save if it took damage? Yeah, is there a... Yeah, yeah, a concentration check. Yeah, sorry.
Kaladen Shash 01:42:43 oh i love that answer yeah
Cletus Cobbington 01:42:53 All right.
Dungeon Master 01:43:01 Would it have? No, it hasn't taken over 30 damage on a single hit, which would be the only way that it would barf him up, and it's not concentrating on a spell right now. Five. Oh, there's no save. It's not at the end of your turn. You cannot picture it's there. You'd have to help out in a different way.
Leopold Magnus 01:43:12 Okay. Five. Oh.
Kaladen Shash 01:43:14 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:43:30 Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:43:31 You have your turn if you want to do it, but your turn cannot be directed to something that doesn't exist to you.
Leopold Magnus 01:43:38 uh yeah so i guess i'll say i'll turn to i could do some healing uh sorry i guess i don't have any healing uh spells
Cletus Cobbington 01:43:59 Hello.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:00 Oh, I'll cast Heroism. But I'll cast it... I'll upcast it. Cast it at the fourth level. And so then... I thought I did, but I couldn't find him. Maybe I panicked. Yeah, I think I'll just do the Heroism. Yep.
Dungeon Master 01:44:11 I also thought you had healing spells. I mean, I think you're right. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:26 which will give you an extra temporary hit points. So let's say five temporary hit points each round. And I'll cast that up to how many players?
Kaladen Shash 01:44:39 Yep.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:58 Second level or higher. I got one additional creature for each spell slot above the first. So I cast it at the fourth level so I can get three people. So I'll just get the remaining party. Seeing that they're struggling, I don't know what's going on. Cletus just tumbled. Oh, Cletus, stand up straight, son.
Dungeon Master 01:45:09 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:21 Then I'll cast Heroism, and maybe it stiffens his spine a little bit. His armor sits a little better. He feels more confident. He's got five temporary hit points, along with Kaladin and Cyrus. Oh, yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:45:24 Oh.
Kaladen Shash 01:45:35 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:39 Doesn't that also give you advantage on some wisdom thing? Oh, okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:45:40 You got it. You got it.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:48 Immune to being frightened and gains temporary hit points. Yeah, so just immune to being frightened. But yeah, good looking out. Yeah, that's my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:45:59 At the start of the round, it is its turn again. It took only fire damage that round, I believe, which means it heals a single head
Cletus Cobbington 01:46:08 Jesus.
Dungeon Master 01:46:20 And because you guys stopped it from growing its heads on its last turn, it would have grown nine heads if you hadn't prevented that. It grows two heads for every one that you are. Oh, two. It would have grown six, not nine. It would have had eight total.
Zariel Torgan 01:46:33 Wow.
Kaladen Shash 01:46:33 Oh, just because of how much damage you get. Oh, wow.
Leopold Magnus 01:46:33 Uh...
Cletus Cobbington 01:46:46 So what's it back up to right now? Is it dead?
Dungeon Master 01:46:46 That was a key stop. So now it's back up to three heads. I don't know what to do. It's 30 feet away. Nobody came close because it stunned everybody. It takes six fire damage. It's an action to put itself out. Is that what it is?
Zariel Torgan 01:47:03 Takes 6 fire damage on its turn. It says in the description that it takes the actions of all heads to put it out. That's what it says on my sheet. Oddly specific.
Kaladen Shash 01:47:19 I think it is. Yep. Exactly that. Just going to keep burning like that.
Dungeon Master 01:47:26 I wasn't going to do individual. It is going to unengulf you. It's going to vomit you out. And then it's going to stop singing its mind song and take three attacks on you. And then I think it's
Dungeon Master 01:47:54 It's going to try to swallow you after this, too. It'll just keep doing that. OK. But it does not have advantage. Just attacking you three times. First attack is a 31 to hit 19 on the die.
Cletus Cobbington 01:48:00 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:11 So what's it doing? Okay. Yeah, I have an AC of 13, so unless it rolls a 1, it's going to hit.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:27 Peace.
Dungeon Master 01:48:31 You take 14 points of piercing damage, and you are grappled. It's going to take another attack at you with advantage because you're grappled. Right, it's just going to take another attack. 17 was the first number, so that's the 29.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:51 I can't be grappled.
Dungeon Master 01:49:02 OK, good to know that as a fire mental, it cannot swallow you again. You take 14 points of damage. And its third attack, not with advantage, is another 19 on the die. 31 total. You take 19 points of damage.
Dungeon Master 01:49:34 And it will how fucked up is the fire element looking? Mm hmm.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:47 Uh, very. I only had 102 hit points. So that was three attacks that hit? Alright, it takes a d10 every time it hits me.
Cyrus Schwert 01:49:53 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:50:03 Okay, go ahead and roll that. It is going to, it'll stay there. I'll just keep it simple. Nine, two, and nine, 20 damage total. Okay, after that it is Sireth.
Cyrus Schwert 01:50:31 I'm going to run. I'm not stunned anymore, right? Got it. I'm going to run just all the way to it, use a dash action, and get on the other side of them if I take
Dungeon Master 01:50:36 No. Stun has dropped. It is not singing. You guys can both register its existence and do something if you would like. That was kind of the gamble round to get a huge jump on Zomreal.
Cyrus Schwert 01:51:01 In attack of opportunity, I take one. Just to run through, like, through his space. Okay. All right, then... To be honest, that's going to be that turn, I think. I don't have many bonus action any time soon, besides portion.
Dungeon Master 01:51:05 You wouldn't have left it space. Oh, it can't. Yeah, you stay in the whole time. Okay. And it is Kaladin.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:27 My math was off. I am no longer an elemental by two hit points. So I'm in front. Yeah, yeah. I just went back and added it up because it didn't seem right. But yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:51:34 OK. I think that's just more incentive for the stay there anyway. So you're just in front of it. No, you're good. The decision makes more sense and less like I'm being nice. Instead of just running away. Nice.
Kaladen Shash 01:51:53 I'm going to cast a Sophric Blast for the first action. Dirty 20 to hit. So this is just fourth damage, and then I'll close the distance. It's just two. I'll close it.
Dungeon Master 01:52:08 20 hits. Two. It should be 30.
Kaladen Shash 01:52:23 It looks like it's 25 or 30 feet. Looks like it's 30 feet right up to melee range. Yeah, and then I can do two attacks with advantage here, light splitter. Yeah, 27 on the first one.
Dungeon Master 01:52:51 37 hits. 30, 20 hits.
Kaladen Shash 01:52:52 30, 20.
Leopold Magnus 01:53:03 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:53:21 I'm going to reroll, so make that a 27. I'm going to reroll that one of the D6s with a 1. 4, 31.
Dungeon Master 01:53:29 Okay. 27 plus... 4... 31 plus 2... 33, not quite enough to cut off a head, but good damage. Okay. Anything else? Yeah, so both Fire and Radiant have been dealt 5th round.
Kaladen Shash 01:53:49 And that was some radiant damage for the round. That's it. That's it.
Dungeon Master 01:54:02 Cletus, you were up. Cletus is in theory like 50 feet away because you went, you're 45 feet away because you went 25 and then it moved 30. You should just be on the general map.
Cletus Cobbington 01:54:06 OK. Are we on? Did we switch map locations or the actual visual map? OK. Cool, cool, cool. Just making sure. Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:54:25 We did to a large. Yeah, take it down.
Cletus Cobbington 01:54:37 I'm trying to figure out if I should set up some healing thing, or if I should just go for damage. Because it seems like we should try to kill this fast. All right, fuck it. We're going fifth level moonbeam on its ass. So con saving throw.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:50 Yeah, fuck this thing.
Kaladen Shash 01:54:58 people.
Dungeon Master 01:55:06 You've got it. Save. That's plus 11. That is a 24. 29. 14.
Leopold Magnus 01:55:07 Bye.
Cletus Cobbington 01:55:17 That passes. OK, half damage. Another one. Half a 29. Let's see.
Cletus Cobbington 01:55:39 I'm going, and also I will bonus action. Oh, wait. You can only cast one spell a turn. Never mind. That'd be it.
Leopold Magnus 01:55:43 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:55:46 Oh, boy. If you have a bonus action cantrip, you could do that. Oh, moonbeam's a bonus action, right? If you have a cantrip action, you could test that.
Kaladen Shash 01:55:50 Unless the other one's a cantrip. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:56:05 So cantrips, it can be a full action cantrip or just a bonus action? Well, moonbeam's an action.
Dungeon Master 01:56:10 Yeah, you get one spell. You can do two spells in the same round if one of them is a cantrip and your action economy works out. So you used a bonus action spell. If you have an action cantrip, you can cast that. Oh, well, if you have a bonus action spell, you... Bonus action cantrip. Makes sense.
Kaladen Shash 01:56:28 Oh, is there a bonus action to move it? There you go. So yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:56:33 Uh, not really. Okay. That's it then.
Dungeon Master 01:56:42 Zariel, it is your turn. You are naked and afraid and in front of this creature and you get to do something.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:53 All right, I'm going to walk forward and touch it. And let's see. I'm going to cast Contagion, so it's going to be a con save 17. It'll probably pass. All right.
Dungeon Master 01:57:13 on save 17. That is a dirty 20. 49, 24.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:23 We'll take half of this. That's 49 necrotic damage. So take 24. And then bonus action, I'm going to use my second wild shape to my earth elemental form.
Dungeon Master 01:57:44 Okay. Earth elemental.
Cletus Cobbington 01:58:16 you
Dungeon Master 01:58:18 Okay. Nicely done. Earth elemental. After that it is Leopold. What do we go for?
Leopold Magnus 01:58:29 Oh, oh, oh, oh dear, what's going on? And I'll make my wisdom saving throw and lord help me. It's a nine. What's that? Aren't I still dominated?
Dungeon Master 01:58:49 What are you making a wisdom save for? No, it dropped out a while ago, but you didn't register it because of the song, but it stopped singing. So you have your full turn as normal. Yeah, the only thing you have to keep in mind is you were like 30 feet away. That's the only thing you have to overcome to get back into combat.
Leopold Magnus 01:59:03 Oh, excellent. It stopped singing. Okay. Even better. Then... Okay. Well, I have 30 feet of movement, so I will move up towards it. Can I say I pick up Bone Crusher and carry him with me? Maybe I give him a little... Maybe he kind of rolls out
Dungeon Master 01:59:26 Yep, I like that. We know he's smaller than you. Well, we're not, no. You don't get that and that. He can move on his turn.
Leopold Magnus 01:59:33 A little bit behind over there by Cyrus. All right. Well, then he's right next to me. I both have. So then I will take two strikes with my searing saber now that this thing has come back into my memory. This must be pretty traumatic going in and out.
Cletus Cobbington 01:59:43 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:00:02 This is awful. And as you guys are right next to it, looking at it, the humanoid faces, the one that hasn't been cut away, one of the main ones, looks kind of familiar. But that one does not hit. Go ahead and roll your second attack. 17. Hit.
Leopold Magnus 02:00:06 Oh. Interesting. All right. Second attack. Oh, it's super laggy. No. 17? OK, well, that's good.
Kaladen Shash 02:00:29 Okay. I see the number. That's good. That's good. That was fire damage.
Leopold Magnus 02:00:35 Oh, that's what I needed. I needed some help. Let's see what I get with the fire. I won. So 15 damage on that strike. Oh, wait. Hold on. Wasn't that with advantage? Because I'm flanking with these guys. Excellent. Well, the one I missed, I get a reroll. Natural 20. Excellent.
Dungeon Master 02:00:38 15 damage. 15 damage. Yep. Yeah, you'd have advantage if you get in that 20. You got in that 20. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:01:04 You go.
Dungeon Master 02:01:07 Roll that double dice. So you are at 15 damage so far in your turn. So that was 6 and 6 doubled. So that was 12 and 12 plus your modifier. Oh, plus 6. 12, 12, 12. So 36 damage plus 15 damage is 51 damage. How do you chop off one of the heads?
Leopold Magnus 02:01:21 So is this doubled then? Oh, okay. Flashing back into this battle and kind of taking stock of everything. I just kind of run haphazardly with my saber out and just
Leopold Magnus 02:01:46 scream, die you filthy beast! And I just run right through it. I'm holding the sword up in the air and I just kind of run underneath its neck and it just lops off and falls behind me. Yeah. Two attacks. Yeah, it's just fire.
Dungeon Master 02:01:55 Run underneath and the head just drops behind you with a thick thud. OK, so that's both radiant and fire. Bone pressure gets to go. OK.
Leopold Magnus 02:02:10 Yep, and then... Oh, I'll use a bonus action to pull up Magic Stone. And then Bone Crusher will kind of position... just surround this creature so it has no chance of escape. And he will do a Force Empowered Rend. Let me kind of find how much that is. So annoying. It's hard to find. Sorry. Oh. Plus Dying to Hit.
Dungeon Master 02:02:39 Oh, you're good. Nice, 25 hits.
Leopold Magnus 02:02:42 And it's a 1d8 plus 4 on the force damage. So plus 9 to this. Oh, that would hit. 25. And 1d8. 3. So, yeah, another 7 damage from Bone Crusher.
Dungeon Master 02:03:11 Nice. Some more damage. That takes us. It's looking very hurt. But at the start of its turn, having taken both forms of damage in that round, looking this hurt. It's a roll of con sitting there at the start of its turn. Also at the start of its turn, it
Cletus Cobbington 02:03:30 And it needs to roll a con saving throw. Come on.
Kaladen Shash 02:03:36 Starting around. Moonbeam's going to get it.
Dungeon Master 02:03:40 Rolls to see if it gets its harrowing scream back, as it is desperate. It gets a 5 on the dice, which is a recharge on 5, 6. So this will all happen simultaneously, because I think even with half damage, you might take it out, depending on your roll. Pawn save is 21. Yeah. And it's on fire, so it'll take fire damage.
Zariel Torgan 02:04:02 Can I add something real fast? So... Well, yeah, yeah, but part of Contagion is that I get to choose an ability that it has disadvantage on. Oh, no, no, that's if it's... Oh, okay, no, that's just if it gets poisoned. Okay, never mind. Sorry.
Dungeon Master 02:04:18 Doesn't it have to succeed? Or does it just take effect? Okay. 21.5. 10. It is not dead. Roll dead. Fire damage.
Kaladen Shash 02:04:18 Let's go.
Cletus Cobbington 02:04:36 10. Bouts. That was not.
Zariel Torgan 02:04:44 Well, he never put himself out. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:04:46 No, he's a full action. He's not going to do that. He has four hit points. He has one hit point. Everybody give me a Constitution saving throw DC 20.
Kaladen Shash 02:04:47 Oh, he's still up. That's all right. Cyrus. All teed up. Get out of here. Get out of here.
Leopold Magnus 02:05:08 Damn, I'm not looking hot. Nope. Mm-mm.
Kaladen Shash 02:05:16 I'm not. 12, 14, 9. Nobody's getting up on this one. 14. Oh. Yeah, nobody's got to just hightail it.
Dungeon Master 02:05:32 Okay, nobody beat a 20. You all take 32 points of psychic damage and you are stunned. 32. 32. Cyrus has resistance to psychic.
Cyrus Schwert 02:05:35 How many did you say?
Leopold Magnus 02:05:40 32. You have Resistance, Cletus. Don't forget about that. Cletus. Well, both of them do, because I imbued Psychic Resistance into Cletus's armor.
Kaladen Shash 02:05:45 You said 30? Cyrus has got his choker. Dude, don't check that. You got your shield and other stuff in there too. You've got a fireball.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:49 Cyrus? Oh, shit. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:05:57 Tyrus. I don't think that was ever actually made yet. So I don't have that marked down. Oh, shit.
Dungeon Master 02:06:17 His imbuement, I think, is separate, right? Isn't that one of your tinkering things, or is that an item? Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 02:06:31 That was just to remember I asked if that armor could be enchanted with a little bit of magic via the souls that my sword had absorbed. And so I tried to imbue it with the soul of the illithid, the elder brain, to give his armor some psychic resistance.
Dungeon Master 02:06:46 Right, yeah. OK. I mean, he didn't die this time, so it doesn't super come into play. But yeah, you guys do your best to remember that. And I'll try to make the item, too, just to give it a better thing. Because I think I reminded Trav to take his resistance, too. But I don't always do a good job of that. Anyway, you all take that damage.
Leopold Magnus 02:07:09 Yeah, it's kind of a one-off weird thing.
Cyrus Schwert 02:07:13 No.
Dungeon Master 02:07:14 You were all stunned until the end of its next turn. So full round goes by. It's still up. At the start of its turn, it regrows one head and 10 hit points. So it's now at 11 hit points with three heads. So I want to be a little shitter.
Dungeon Master 02:07:40 One of its heads is going to do its Mind Song ability. It'll take two attacks before that. Zario and Leopold, the two worse off ones. You were stunned, so it gets advantage. Natural 20 on Zario.
Leopold Magnus 02:07:48 That fucking bullshit man. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:08:10 Oh, yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:08:13 And 31 on Leopold. Zara, you take 28. Oh, you're not as hurt as it felt. It's a wasted action. You're a fucking rock elemental. 28 points of piercing damage. I should have remembered that one.
Leopold Magnus 02:08:17 Yeah, a 31 on wisdom definitely fails.
Zariel Torgan 02:08:42 For some reason, my D&D Beyond, when I change my elemental, is also dropping my regular hit points. And when I adjust my elemental, it's adjusting my hit points. So it's all fucky.
Dungeon Master 02:08:53 Leopold gets 11 points. Leopold goes down. With that, it's two attacks, and then everybody give me a wisdom saving throw to remember that it exists.
Leopold Magnus 02:08:57 11 points, I go down. Even if I'm down on the ground like that. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:09:14 I know it's there. I know it's there. Dirty 20. See, that's enough.
Dungeon Master 02:09:18 You are unconscious. You are unconscious, but you're not dead. You can hear it. So yeah, go ahead and make it. So Zariel fails. Cyrus fails. Leopold fails. Kaladin and Cletus succeed.
Cyrus Schwert 02:09:28 What's the density?
Leopold Magnus 02:09:29 Dude, I haven't rolled over like 15 tonight on that. That's tough.
Dungeon Master 02:09:48 After that, it is going to try to run away. So the two of you, everybody's in melee range, but Kaladin and Cletus can give me attacks of opportunity as it's going to try to run. 11 hit points. Somebody's got a hit, and that's all.
Cletus Cobbington 02:10:12 That's with like a melee weapon, right? 26. 26. Oh, f***ing 1. My basic ass...
Dungeon Master 02:10:15 Yes. Unless you've got War Caster, and then you can do a spell. 27 hits. 26 hits. 20 points of damage.
Kaladen Shash 02:10:15 27 27 to hit 16 16 damage
Zariel Torgan 02:10:32 Yes.
Dungeon Master 02:10:43 as Paladin cuts through its torso and Cletus clobbers it in the head and the top half of its body spins and goes free as the bottom slumps to the side. It is down on the ground, an unmoving... With that attack, it took Radiant...
Kaladen Shash 02:10:45 Yep.
Cletus Cobbington 02:10:58 I smack it after it had already died.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:01 Still on fire, right?
Dungeon Master 02:11:08 and I'll just just to speed things up because the fight took a pretty good amount of time ticks radiant as the round goes you see the head like starts to twitch and like it's trying to grow back I think if it's like with cut in half and stuff it'll be doesn't matter it's unconscious one of you guys can do fire damage you can light a torch on it if you want it
Kaladen Shash 02:11:18 fire. Someone should be with fire. Oh, I haven't taken my turn yet. I'm going to cast... You're going to cast just Firebolt? Should I hit it? Isn't it still burning then? Isn't it still burning? Okay, okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:11:22 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:11:36 But yeah, you just hit it real quick and the fire fell. I said like as it slumped over, the fire was put out, but it's so easy to put it back on fire. It really doesn't matter. Combat ends. Leopold's on the ground, unmoving. You guys are heavy breath. Have a second. It doesn't move. Doesn't seem like it's going to get up at this point. What would you guys like to do?
Kaladen Shash 02:11:49 Yeah, we just killed it. Remember?
Cletus Cobbington 02:11:49 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:12:08 Real quick, do we remember it? Do we see it? OK. Gotcha. I'm going to do a mass cure ones. So everybody gets 16.
Dungeon Master 02:12:15 Yeah, once it's dead and it stops singing, the mind song is what makes you not hear it.
Cletus Cobbington 02:12:27 Damn, I would love to have that spell.
Cyrus Schwert 02:12:41 All right.
Kaladen Shash 02:12:42 Thank you. It was a great role.
Zariel Torgan 02:12:43 And then I'm going to go over to Leo. And I'm going to hit him with a 4th level Cure Wounds. And I'm going to hit Cyrus with a 4th level Cure Wounds. First one's going to be Leo. That's going to be... 46. And then this one will be for Cyrus. And then this will be...
Leopold Magnus 02:12:54 Nice. Pretty sex, hell yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:12:59 Wait. Let me look at my... I think... I think Cyrus would have also gained...
Dungeon Master 02:13:07 46 insane. What does it say?
Zariel Torgan 02:13:11 39 for Cyrus.
Cyrus Schwert 02:13:14 Wow.
Cletus Cobbington 02:13:20 Wait, so would he have gained double health since he's bonded with the almond right now from the first one? Or is that like, if he already got healed by it, he just gets that one heal? Let's see. While this bond lasts, whenever you are subjected to a spell or magical effect that restores hit points, the bonded creature also receives the benefit of the spell. So I mean, he already...
Leopold Magnus 02:13:26 Oh.
Kaladen Shash 02:13:35 So that mass cure wounds would have gotten them twice centrally.
Dungeon Master 02:13:44 Yeah, so when you heal Pletus, Cyrus heals that too. I guess, yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:13:51 Right. Yeah, that's what I was asking. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:58 Oh, well then instead of that one going to him, because it would have already filled him up, I'll send that 39 to Kaladin. So you can add that, because it would have been redundant at that point.
Kaladen Shash 02:14:15 Oh, closing the gap. Nearly recharged right there. Yep.
Cyrus Schwert 02:14:16 let's find this fucking portal and get out of here
Leopold Magnus 02:14:18 Nice. Back up to half health, yeah. That was a tough fight. Oh, you gave 60. Oh, I didn't realize you dished out some more. Oh, wow. Pretty good. 62, yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:14:28 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:14:30 Wait, Leo. Leo, you would have got that 16 as well on the Massacred Wounds. Hmm. I guess I could add that for myself, too.
Dungeon Master 02:14:39 He gave 16 and then 46.
Kaladen Shash 02:14:49 What was that thing? Yes.
Leopold Magnus 02:14:49 Well, I guess I went down so that you lost that temporary hit points. Oh, to be honest, I never saw it. Came out of nowhere.
Zariel Torgan 02:14:59 That's fucking crazy.
Cletus Cobbington 02:15:03 Well, since we're on a big healing kick, let me throw one more thing of healing that'll help everyone at least a little bit. I want to open up my spirit totem and summon my unicorn version. And then I'm going to cast Healing Word on myself. And then when the unicorn's up, everyone gets
Kaladen Shash 02:15:24 you
Dungeon Master 02:15:28 Okay. Okay, so. Yeah, so-called, you heal yourself with a healing word, everybody else gets eight. So, you get your healing word, and then Travis gets eight plus your healing word. So, I get 28, everybody gets eight, so he just gets 20.
Cletus Cobbington 02:15:31 my druid level of healing. So everyone gets eight. And then travel also, or Cyrus will also get the heals. Yes. So Cyrus gets 20.
Cyrus Schwert 02:15:59 Let's go. I'm just fucking I feel great.
Kaladen Shash 02:16:01 That's great. Just majestic.
Cletus Cobbington 02:16:03 Now everyone's looking pretty good. Almonds are very nutritious. And unicorns help too, apparently. I like to imagine just a wonderful, very realistic unicorn just standing in the middle of us right now.
Dungeon Master 02:16:30 Like, not spiritual at all. It's just a horse with a keratin-based horn. Budget unicorn. It's cracking jokes about blue flower red thorns.
Zariel Torgan 02:16:34 Mm-hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 02:16:34 Oh, it's for sure a donkey corn. It's this guy, this guy donkey unicorn. There's no. But like donkey from Shrek. So like even worse somehow. And he just keeps doing. He just keeps doing the mouth noise over and over.
Cyrus Schwert 02:16:35 Holy shit.
Kaladen Shash 02:16:38 Like heavy 80s unicorn vibe. Yep. Yeah. Do we want to go look for where this circle actually is?
Leopold Magnus 02:17:07 Yeah, I think we should probably get out of here.
Cyrus Schwert 02:17:07 I'm on it.
Cletus Cobbington 02:17:08 That sounds pretty good.
Kaladen Shash 02:17:10 Zoriel. Zoriel, that's a good-looking cat. That looks good on you, bud. Cope that out.
Zariel Torgan 02:17:12 Yeah, I think this was all worth it. This was worth this. Do we want to look around at this pool? It seems like it might be an interesting area to take a second and maybe see if it was relevant.
Dungeon Master 02:17:16 You don't need to look at it. It's just a map.
Cyrus Schwert 02:17:41 Just sitting there.
Zariel Torgan 02:17:42 You know, my hat is telling me I think we should just go. Let's go look for that portal.
Leopold Magnus 02:17:45 My hat is still on the IP.
Dungeon Master 02:17:49 yeah tons of plants hell yeah
Cletus Cobbington 02:17:54 Are there any plants around, like vines or something? I want to talk to some vines, because I'm assuming that they'd be sprawling pretty much everywhere around here. But I want to speak with plants. I'm finally using my crutch charges, or my staff charges.
Kaladen Shash 02:18:00 yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:18:21 You see this little Ivy leaf. It kind of almost looks like it's squinting its face and kind of like getting tight lipped with its fake plant mouth. And he goes,
Cletus Cobbington 02:18:22 And I want to just ask, like, do you know where a transportation circle is? I hear there's one in this city. Assuming you would know where that is, if you could point me in the direction.
Dungeon Master 02:18:48 Yeah, maybe I've seen some teleportation circles. Maybe I haven't. Who's asking? Oh, fuck yeah. All right, I like what you're putting down. It sort of like wiggles a little bit. Yeah, um,
Kaladen Shash 02:18:54 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:18:58 I reach in my pocket and grab a handful of soil and just tuck it around it. Nice, nutritious almond soil. This will make you feel real good.
Dungeon Master 02:19:17 What you want to do is you want to head down the street a little bit. There's a tall building surrounded by walls. And there's your teleportation circles. If you get stopped by any plants, you just let them know Ricky sent you. It's like so clean.
Cletus Cobbington 02:19:30 I'm writing that down. Ricky the Vine. I dap him up. Thanks, Ricky. It makes way too crisp of a sound. Oh, fuck. All right.
Kaladen Shash 02:19:34 Oh, that is right.
Leopold Magnus 02:19:35 Ricky Devine. He's got friends in high places.
Cyrus Schwert 02:19:39 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:19:49 Your hand starts itching. You realize he's poison ivy.
Cletus Cobbington 02:20:00 Ricky says it's this way, and I just started walking off.
Dungeon Master 02:20:04 Yeah, Cletus starts leading you down the road. It's like, again, all pretty much like filtered colored light. Everything comes through like the little tree canopies of the pinks, the goldens, the reds. The street is almost paved like stained glass with all the different colored light that kind of comes through. And you're walking down the straight path, and it is sort of, if you're looking at the map, sort of the inlet right here, this wall area to this tall tower.
Dungeon Master 02:20:31 is where you find as you walk in a whole bunch of vines and stuff cover the doorway as it sort of isn't completely encompassed you walk up and you see the plants sort of like rattle and shiver a little bit do you still have your speak with plants up i think you have it for some time
Cletus Cobbington 02:20:49 I believe so. Let me see if it's very specifically one. 10 minutes. The name's Cletus, but I
Kaladen Shash 02:21:03 Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:21:04 Yeah, you see like one of the vines that's sort of blocking the path just goes, yeah, who's asking to pass? Oh shit, you're Ricky's boy? You see this vine daps you up and goes, yeah, you can clear through, it's fine.
Cletus Cobbington 02:21:17 I'm homies with Ricky and he told me I could come in. I'm Ricky's boy. I show him the imprint on my hand where he slapped it. Much better.
Dungeon Master 02:21:31 Sort of the whole wall of vines retreats back, and you have a clear path through this little walled area. As you guys enter the space, it's nothing you've seen, really, because the way it's set up in New New Arbor is different. But you walk into this large cathedral-type room.
Dungeon Master 02:21:51 Super high ceilings, all with this beautiful art, faded in time, destroyed by water damage. There wasn't water up here, but the constant exposure was like being next to an ocean. And you have just these different teleportation circles to different areas in the city, like one-way teleportations. And also you see teleportation circles really big, used to be well-maintained ones, but with labels above them.
Dungeon Master 02:22:18 that says Philantra, New New Arbor, Esoptra. The one to Esoptra, completely trashed. Like, broken long before the stone in the ground has been shattered with like a sledgehammer. The runes are all broken up. Not totally usable. The other two are dark and not active. And you know that you're supposed to be looking for a specific type of sort of
Dungeon Master 02:22:46 Teleportation Circle, everybody who walks in the space can do an intelligence or perception check. You're looking for a DC-25 to find this sort of secret route. Or perception. Sorry, investigation or perception, the two sort of looking for step checks.
Kaladen Shash 02:23:00 You said an intelligence check. Let's go.
Leopold Magnus 02:23:13 Nice. Nat 20. Hell yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:23:16 26, I'm sorry. 28 in Kaladin, natural 20. I think it's really only fitting. The whole party's kind of just looking around. Kaladin's looking, but he doesn't really know what he's looking for because he doesn't have the little rune paper sheet, so he's just kind of like doing the thing where you think you're helpful, but you don't really know what you're doing. And Kaladin, you just get like
Zariel Torgan 02:23:19 Hey. Oh, nice. Awesome.
Dungeon Master 02:23:41 like a silent whisper, like you get a pull, like something's trying to communicate with you and everybody's looking at these teleportation circles and you just feel like it's wrong. And you like look over your left shoulder and this, this old sort of a gnarled tree where the trunk didn't grow super straight. And it's like built into the tower wall is that they built the building around the tree.
Dungeon Master 02:24:06 And you see not lit up at this moment, so it's really hard to see it in the dark. You see this tree has carved runes like an archway in the large, thick trunk. And just based off a memory, you look up at it, and you can tell that the runes on the paper don't go to a teleportation circle. They go to a teleportation rune set, and it, if laid over, would transport well into this archway.
Kaladen Shash 02:24:37 I would share everything and bring, wasn't it Leopold that found the scroll that had some of the information about teleportation? Show him that. Can we imbue it with a little bit of magic so the runes at least glow? Something like that. Yeah, I want to try just.
Leopold Magnus 02:24:47 Yep. Yep. If he told me about it, I'll help him out and give an assist.
Dungeon Master 02:24:57 Do you want to try? Start small just so you guys don't waste anything. You channel like a cantrip's worth of energy just to see if you can like fuel it. And you get resistance. Like something is actively keeping you from doing it.
Dungeon Master 02:25:21 just for the sake of time and wanting to move on to the next sector, just because the fight was a little too long. I'll just speed things up. There's another tower that you have to go to. So you guys are working to figure this out. You had slept the night before, so you were actually earlier in the day than I thought. So you've got a lot of time to play here. You guys are channeling, etching these runes to adjust them. A couple members of the party break off. You go to this guard tower.
Dungeon Master 02:25:48 Search it. There's nothing important. There's no important lore or anything. But you find this arcane switch in a guard tower down the road that is acting like an anti-magic. AOE, where in turning it on, disables the magic effect in the teleportation area like a failsafe. So you imagine that this was turned off when the city was sieged, never activated again.
Cyrus Schwert 02:26:10 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 02:26:16 So through some work, you guys end up deactivating that, going back into the room, etching it, and I will have the two clerics. What? Let me look it up. It is going to be, what is transport via plants? What's going to spell?
Dungeon Master 02:26:53 It is a six level spell. You guys don't have six level slots, right? And then I'll have a two of you. It'll just be two successes before two failures. Wisdom based checks, like using your spell modifier.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:57 No not yet.
Dungeon Master 02:27:19 like you're making a spell attack kind of deal, just d20 plus the modifier. You hit a dc20, it's a success. You can get help in other ways if you'd like. So work together how best you can to get this teleportation spell into effect.
Zariel Torgan 02:27:43 I've got a plus nine. What's your spell attack, Cletus? Plus ten. So why don't I guide you or something? Would that work, Jonathan? Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:27:43 Can I?
Cletus Cobbington 02:27:48 I got a plus 10.
Dungeon Master 02:27:57 Get a d4. It's attack rolls and saving throws, right? Is guidance or is guidance? No, guidance is any roll. Yeah, you can have Cletus make it with a d4. Okay. Trace, we're looking for 220 plus rolls before you get two failures.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:08 Yeah, so I'll guide and then see if we can help you with that. Ace.
Cletus Cobbington 02:28:22 Does guidance only work once? Cool. Go on. Sorry, I do. 26.
Dungeon Master 02:28:24 He'll do it each time you go to roll, so you get a d4 on every single one. 20, success. You see that the runes start lightly glowing a faint green. Going around slow, and we got 26.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:51 Six.
Cyrus Schwert 02:28:52 Bang. Bang.
Dungeon Master 02:28:53 the runes fully ignite
Dungeon Master 02:28:57 two successes back to back, you see the tree splits down an invisible seam in the center and it sort of gives way into it. And you guys get blasted with a cold front in front of your face as snow in this sort of fine powder blow into this tropical temperate forest jungle area. And you guys see out in front of you is sort of this
Dungeon Master 02:29:24 very um opaque obfuscated uh like landscape in front of you there's a big mass of a shape but through the tree and through sort of this storm you have a hard time seeing what it is but you get the sense having successfully opened this that you have um six seconds to go through this tree before it closes
Cletus Cobbington 02:29:47 Uh, what was the name of the vine that led us in? Yeah. Hey, what's your name? Tony.
Zariel Torgan 02:29:51 Oh man.
Cyrus Schwert 02:29:57 Ricky. Oh, different.
Dungeon Master 02:29:57 into this area. You got the name of Ricky. You didn't get the name of the second one. You can shout for it really quick as the other people go in. Tommy! Tommy. Tommy.
Kaladen Shash 02:30:00 We didn't hear this. It's Jimmy. Tony. Joe Tommy.
Cletus Cobbington 02:30:17 Oh, Tommy. I dap up the tree and just say, Ricky and Tommy sent me and just jump through. A trail of soil is behind me.
Dungeon Master 02:30:28 you blow into the next air everybody rushes in you feel the cold air sort of sweep by and it creates sort of this pulling sensation as you are yanked who knows where how far this teleportation took you you have a pretty good sense that it took you where you wanted to go but you're just not entirely sure
Dungeon Master 02:30:54 What you guys see next as you land, this tree that lets you in, as you turn around, what you see, we'll give a description here. Beyond the snow-drowned peaks of the northern crown cascades lies the Ashen Grove.
Cletus Cobbington 02:31:01 No, okay.
Dungeon Master 02:31:15 The land drops sharply into a massive, bowl-shaped basin. On its northern coastline, it slopes, crumbling and treacherous, rendering the region nearly inaccessible by foot. Sparse forests of dead, gnarled trees scatter across the landscape, a vast expanse that is eternally dusted by a ceaseless fall of fine gray ash that mixes with the thin snow that permeates the area.
Dungeon Master 02:31:45 The air here is choked with the mingling of cold and death, carrying a metallic tang that clings to the tongue and nose. Ash falls from an impossibly tall tree, a colossal ash tree so vast that its bowed canopy seems to merge with the low gray clouds of the heavens.
Dungeon Master 02:32:10 From this distance, the tree takes on a slate-gray color. The bark appears more akin to granite than wood. Jagged, smooth pieces fit up, almost mimicking wooden bark as it climbs the whole tree. How big is the tree? Hard to say. 100, 200 feet in diameter? Can't tell from this distance. You look over this tree.
Dungeon Master 02:32:36 You realize that you are standing on this like somewhat thin ledge. There's a little decrepit cabin long since overtaken and fallen. Ash clings to your clothes almost immediately. You have at first just gray. You brush it. It turns like a gross brown. You sort of get the sense of your surroundings. You are...
Dungeon Master 02:33:03 As far back as you could possibly be, it seems like you know that there's some weird fuckery with the magic. You read something a while ago, and Cyrus had some book knowledge from when he had read about this while he was sort of attending lectures, that there's like an AT health field. The closer you get to the tree, people start getting sick. It's harder to heal things like
Dungeon Master 02:33:25 You get the sense that this is the closest safe place to teleport to as you are like just at the edge of the bowl looking down into it. This is a very rudimentary camp.
Dungeon Master 02:33:37 There's some thick, short evergreen trees that are just completely void of like any healthy foliage. It's all dead and falling off. Inside the sort of collapsed cabin are, it's a single room of like four abandoned cots.
Dungeon Master 02:33:57 a broken table. There's a black, empty, cold, recessed fire pit in the center of the room, but nothing else much is what you see. Looking ahead, you see these different areas. There is an expanse of just trees that almost look like glass or crystal. They're jagged, sharp, and they're losing color.
Dungeon Master 02:34:22 There's an area like a huge crevice where it's like the land drops off and there's huge piles of snow that kind of bridge it. And it looks like a thin, safe path that's been carved.
Dungeon Master 02:34:34 Beyond that, you see the roots of the tree start to be a little bit more prominent. There's huge ridges of roots that come in and out of the ground, making the terrain really treacherous. And you see at the very center of the tree, from your distance, so far away, you can still see it, dull orange glow permeating from the center, deep in the tree.
Dungeon Master 02:34:58 And as you guys stand at this location, there is a, if you check out the cabin, a little map that had been drawn by one of the people who had traveled here at some point. And you learn that you were at a location that has been termed the Ashen Watch. And ahead of you is the Emberwake Crossing, the Hollow of Black Roots.
Dungeon Master 02:35:27 the Tree of Death, and something called the Cradle of Cinders. And that's where we'll leave it. Not getting to the other characters on this section. Oh, you're welcome.
Kaladen Shash 02:35:33 Of course. It's great.
Leopold Magnus 02:35:40 Damn. Nice. That is sick. Well, thanks for running that session again. Appreciate it. Yeah, that thing was persistent. Oh.
Cletus Cobbington 02:35:42 That's sick as fuck.
Cyrus Schwert 02:35:46 Thanks, man. Oh, funny.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:52 Yeah, it was awesome. It was a sweet monster. Oh, interesting. Yeah, it makes sense.
Dungeon Master 02:35:57 Yeah, you guys... It was gross, but that was the old High Council. That's why they look familiar. They, like, were mutated by the Cursed King into being some grotesque monster when he took over. So the one head was super familiar because it was the dark-haired elven shape that you...
Kaladen Shash 02:36:07 Oh. Luis.
Leopold Magnus 02:36:11 So the monster, they combined together and became that.
Dungeon Master 02:36:28 Didn't really know, but that was the first council of Moonhaven, and all of the lords were the underheads. Because you started cutting off so quickly that I was like, okay, they don't get to look at that one. They don't get to look at that one. Oh, that one's gone. I was like, oh, shit. We're down three heads before it goes. Yeah. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:36:35 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 02:36:45 That's funny. Jonathan, so the Moonhaven Dome is more fae, like elven. Like most of the inhabitants were elven. I guess we'll get to it, but did the domes in their heyday, like the high councils would travel between domes occasionally? Like would they have business to do that?
Dungeon Master 02:37:06 The High Council. And this is something you picked up lore-wise. There is, even in the flashbacks you've had, there seemed to be one figure who talked to Zariel's character at some point who mentioned that he was sneaking out of the domes, going on excursions. So you know that it's not super copacetic to be going out in the wild. It was dangerous even at that point.
Cletus Cobbington 02:37:07 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:37:27 Right. Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:37:36 But you did also know that at one point all of domes could teleport freely between each other. So they could go dome to dome to dome, but like leaving the domes was forbidden. Unless it was like the origin days of the dome when they were still figuring out what the land was like. They used to be adventurers back then, but that's way, way before the story took place.
Leopold Magnus 02:37:58 Presumably when teleportation between dome to dome was happening, people would come and go. Got it. Cool.
Dungeon Master 02:38:04 Yeah, absolutely. People would go to different domes on vacations, sightseeing, cultural differences. That was like part of the justification for like the mixed blending of the races. Everything was just so intertwined at first that everybody just became like a singular race with time. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:38:24 That's, that's helpful to know. That's what I was assuming, but wanted to double check. Right on. Yeah, I think so. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:38:35 Hell yeah. We're... We're still... We're not... We're not, like, canceling next one, right? Next one is still fine. Next session. Cool. That one...
Cletus Cobbington 02:38:36 Who?
Cyrus Schwert 02:38:46 Yeah. What is it?
Zariel Torgan 02:38:48 Think so, yeah.

Zariel Torgan 00:00:00 Oh, gotcha. Okay. Craig fucks. Damn.
Dungeon Master 00:00:03 Greg, fuck. This is session 25, guys. We've made it to a quarter century. Our last action started with you guys. You guys recruited after finding the cobald.
Cyrus Schwert 00:00:03 Oh my gosh. This guy fucks. Yeah. He does two things. He's a voyeur and he helps. Woo! Been here since day one. He's been here the whole time.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:06 Greg's fucking. Jeez.
Dungeon Master 00:00:26 You advanced up the mountain at one point avoiding a large group numbering somewhere in the hundreds of knolls who were marching down the mountain. You elected to proceed further up figuring that there was no way you'd win against an army, but that you still potentially had a chance to defeat the large creature near the top. On your way, you encountered an elderly, close to death, Kangku sort of bird folk.
Dungeon Master 00:00:50 who was malnourished and chained to, like, this wall who claimed to be a devout follower of a creature he called the Great Fire Spirit. This general from the cursed war, this large creature who, after everything ended, just sort of found a spot to roost, and then he brought sort of bounties to the land. This...
Zariel Torgan 00:00:50 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:01:17 group of sort of fanatical knolls claimed it first to want to worship it but then eventually sort of twisted it and praised bloodshed and destruction and they sacked all of the establishments around the area with the last being cottonwood
Dungeon Master 00:01:34 Dale, Cottonwood being very sort of poor and all the resources stripped from the regular raids. This creature had begun twisted and cursed, and he asked you through any means necessary to free it. You found and battled this creature after Elder Pyretong had died from you guys sort of questioning him to death. And this sort of long thought that saw multiple near-death experiences,
Dungeon Master 00:02:02 um bone pressure was melted and we invented roasted almonds and roasted almond milk um you eventually won you took your loot consisting of various unworked gold precious and unprecious stones and then a particularly interesting golden egg from the nest and you made your way back down the mountain noticing with a very high perception check that the army of noles had sort of scattered into the plains and the forest
Cyrus Schwert 00:02:10 Hello.
Dungeon Master 00:02:30 You regrouped at Cornelius's shaman hut at the end of the creek of the town where he rewarded you with the staff. And so we ended it with you guys sort of having your downtime right before you went to take your long rest. But we hadn't gotten to the long rest yet. So as you guys are...
Dungeon Master 00:02:53 like essentially taking a short rest before the long rest you've got a couple hours to do anything that you'd like to or if you just want to move right into going to sleep you're taking shifts what are they if not what are you doing all that stuff but would the odiers like to do
Cyrus Schwert 00:03:13 I would I would love to pick on a couple almonds on the green orb in this new staff and start to a tune.
Zariel Torgan 00:03:13 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:03:25 Nice. You sit sort of bow and frost-legged on the wood and the staff sits in front of you and then eventually kind of like just starts to hover as you attuned to it. And eventually it sort of goes perfectly horizontal and you grab it. And after 30 minutes, you have successfully attuned to the staff.
Cyrus Schwert 00:03:47 Let's go. Does your staff have almonds in it? Indeed. That's funny. Can Chip use it? Is it like horse hammer and no one else can? Chip can rest atop, but a little big of a twig for him, I believe. That's a great idea.
Leopold Magnus 00:03:59 And I don't know.
Dungeon Master 00:04:16 I mean, feel free to tell him. Rule a D20. On a natural one, he gets hurt, but otherwise nothing happens.
Cyrus Schwert 00:04:17 I rip out a green orb and stuff tip in instead. Does it lose all magical property or does it get stronger? Rolling the real one. Seven. Or wait, is that a one? That's the one.
Zariel Torgan 00:04:41 Oh no.
Leopold Magnus 00:04:42 Ha ha.
Dungeon Master 00:04:45 I don't want to hurt your fucking familiar. You cast a ninth level time stop. No, you go to like try to pry out the gem and like for a second you swear you see the arcane magic flicker off before it kind of resumes and you take your hand off unsure of what you did.
Cyrus Schwert 00:04:47 I real quick, real quick, reverse. I cast the holy spell reverse. Bruno reverse card.
Cyrus Schwert 00:05:18 And I go up to Leopold and I say, are you all right, dude? You got, like, really bugged up. You've got a couple of things. You've got a couple of things.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:25 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:05:26 Oh, well, and I kind of raise my arm or attempt to, and there's no arm there. I guess I could use a little bit of repairs. And that's, yeah, that's what I'll do. I'll work on, yeah. Could you do me a favor and pop my back here?
Cyrus Schwert 00:05:49 For sure. I pull out a plunger and I do it on one of his big tents in the back.
Leopold Magnus 00:05:58 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:05:58 You, yeah, pull one out, but you also notice you haven't seen him or been around him long enough to notice before, but as you're doing this, you see that gradually over time all of Leopold's dense kind of undo themselves. He's got like an innate mending cantrip constantly running with his armor. So you get the big ones an assist, but you see that his like armor is reforming itself with time also.
Cyrus Schwert 00:06:26 Is it loud? Does it like clunk? You go, buddy?
Dungeon Master 00:06:30 Like, there's certain ones that sound particularly sharp, but most of it is just sort of like a clay, like it sort of forms out very smooth and fluid in motion. Anywhere there's like a sharp dent from like an act, right? That one kind, those kind of pop.
Leopold Magnus 00:06:50 Well, thank you. That's quite kind of you. In my free time, I will start working on the shotgun blueprint that I had promised Chip.
Dungeon Master 00:07:07 Nice. What is sort of the first step that you want to achieve with it? Yeah. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:07:07 Thomas did you.
Leopold Magnus 00:07:17 Well, I need to gather the materials if I haven't already. Or maybe make some prerequisite materials if I need to.
Dungeon Master 00:07:27 Just in general, because I'll let you know the things you have to kind of look for. There's like all of the non-magical materials you'll be able to just like say you have. But if you're if you want to do a specific thing with it at first, you might need like certain very specific like arcane magical items.
Leopold Magnus 00:07:47 OK. I think first I'll just start by prototyping the gunpowder or the propellant equivalent. So not necessarily even crafting the weapon, just trying to figure out the right mix of saltpeter and sulfur and all of the necessary components to make an explosion. OK.
Dungeon Master 00:08:00 Yeah, nice. Go ahead and give me an intelligence check.
Leopold Magnus 00:08:27 17.
Cyrus Schwert 00:08:29 I use the app. I think it seems.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:33 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:08:33 17 pretty good. For like just your first day on it, you're making pretty good progress already. You have a pretty good ignition to fuel ratio as far as like the powder and the grid goes. You're getting good spark with your little like experiments that you're doing. No final product yet, but a really solid start.
Leopold Magnus 00:08:57 Excellent. Yeah, I will file that away in my notebook. And then next time I can work on some other stuff. I, uh,
Dungeon Master 00:09:08 Nice, anybody else.
Cyrus Schwert 00:09:13 treating all my stuff again. I don't think so. I know nothing about metal work, so I hand him a big bag of almonds. Hopefully that'll help. That's not going to help build a gun. It does it there.
Leopold Magnus 00:09:27 Find a, you know, kind of hollow tube. I stuff an almond down there. I put a little bit of this salt powder and I say it. Well, I suggest you all stand back. And I put a little pair of safety glasses on and I light the fuse. All right. 19.
Dungeon Master 00:09:41 I roll a D20. 19. He's holding this sort of tube almost just like a wildcat firework thing and like the fuse in the behind lights and there's a second pause or nothing happens and then just
Cyrus Schwert 00:09:44 No way that work.
Zariel Torgan 00:09:44 Damn.
Dungeon Master 00:10:09 the whole front of it explodes and like cartoonishly the tubing splits and frays in all the directions a little too strong of a mixture to start with chips that eyebrows were burned off in the process so you can't tell his expression
Cyrus Schwert 00:10:18 Oh no. So, so. So sense. Noted extra roast on the bad ideas.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:22 Oh dear. Well, I think we're on to something. Chip, do you think you'd be able to hold on to something like that? I'll keep working on it. We're almost there.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:32 And
Dungeon Master 00:10:42 Okay. So, Cletus is attuning. Leopold's working on some artificer stuff. We'll say that. I don't know if Caledon wanted to do anything specific. So we'll say he does nothing for now, but anything from Zario. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:06 Yes, I would like to call forth my puppies from the box. And I want to start going over some new stuff, not like outright, like attacks, but more just like formations. You know, like I throw out like a target and I want them to surround it evenly. And just practice, you know, not clumping up together, spreading out, you know.
Cyrus Schwert 00:11:13 to be a lot of this.
Dungeon Master 00:11:32 Mm-hmm. Give me an handling, animal handling check. They seem, like no real progress is made. In fact, they seem almost like there was just a natural setback that you've spent so little time around them with how busy everything got that they're a little untrusting of you. And I think especially with the recent, um,
Zariel Torgan 00:11:37 All right. Mmm, that's a seven.
Dungeon Master 00:12:03 like just almost outright threat from the lord marshal there's there's something they can tell is going on but they did not anything is bad but they're just wary of the group almost like they're just it's not a good day for training you two because you killed the other two
Zariel Torgan 00:12:15 Yeah. How many of them are there again? Three? Two. Gotcha. Okay. Just making sure. Once I killed your and the other one is parents. So that's their names. No, that's not true. That's mean. All right. Well, I won't get mad at them because I know that
Cyrus Schwert 00:12:21 God. Forever reminded of their painful existence.
Dungeon Master 00:12:35 Dark as a now. Groundwork is getting laid, but it's, yeah, no, just no progress. Okay. As you guys are going to bed, are you taking watches? Are you not? If so, who's doing what, when? How are you guys going to work this?
Zariel Torgan 00:12:42 It takes time to build trust and to build skill. So I will give them treats and pets, and I'll spend the evening that way. All right.
Cyrus Schwert 00:13:06 I mean, we're in a Cornelius's head, right? Or spare room, whatever.
Dungeon Master 00:13:12 He's like, he's got like a guest room that's outdoors. Not like out in the open, but it's detached little living space.
Leopold Magnus 00:13:19 I think I can take a six hour rest and stay in sentry mode, so that should be helpful. I can just stay alert in sentry mode out in front.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:19 Look.
Cyrus Schwert 00:13:38 I don't think we have much reason to not trust him. I mean, did we not already sleep at his house before? Yeah, once I'm attuned, I hit the hay.
Dungeon Master 00:13:47 You already did, yeah. I was just seeing if you guys were all going to sleep, if you were taking watches, that's all.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:56 Yeah, same here. I'll head to bed. Hi. Oh. Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:14:05 Okay. As you guys are going to sleep, um, for the first night between Jesse and Rex, uh, pick higher low.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:07 I'll take high. I'll take low. I'll take low. You go high, I go low.
Cyrus Schwert 00:14:10 murders all of us.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:30 I'll take hi. All right.
Dungeon Master 00:14:36 At the two, who was low? Low, okay. Leopold, you are...
Cyrus Schwert 00:14:41 Was that an answer? Those.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:44 I was slow. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:14:52 in stasis. And as per normal with your stasis, with time, you see the party generally start to go into unconscious. You see like the involuntary jerks of the body as they switch from like a light sleep to a deep sleep. You're just sort of generally scanning things. You watch a Zario eat a spider at one point. But uncharacteristically, you fall asleep.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:15 I was going to ask. Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:15:22 something we're forged are not supposed to do. Your dream or memory or delusion transitions and you sort of come back to in like a dark and messy workshop place. Regular support beams throughout this place but no windows. You realize that you're sweating and as you're focusing and your body is in the same position.
Cyrus Schwert 00:15:23 of
Dungeon Master 00:15:51 straining as you hold your hand out. You're holding a concentration and a spell into a gem as long as you possibly can. Enchanting something, but you don't know what. Eventually, you sort of gasp out and you have to catch yourself as you, the enchantment fails. You just not there yet. You hear some shouting in the floor above you. You are...
Dungeon Master 00:16:17 in a basement then, it seems. You can't make out what it is initially, but eventually you do hear it's about Victor your brother. The man who's speaking his voice is familiar in both cadence and tone. You hear that your brother got into another altercation while training where a noble son bested him in combat and he flew into a blind fury nearly killing him but seriously maiming him.
Cyrus Schwert 00:16:21 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:16:45 He had to be restrained and pulled the way. Then after a little bit of just like low tone that you can't make out, this other figure leaves and you hear some shuffling and steps descend the stairs and you see your mentor, a kindly looking old man with long white hair and a long white beard and like an old wizard's robe comes into view. He looks at you.
Dungeon Master 00:17:15 your shaken state, your sweaty palms, and you see the kind expression on his face kind of washes away and a little bit of disgust arises disapproval. And he goes, I don't remember telling you to stop Leo. And then he shifts his attention elsewhere. Without even looking at you, he's looking at the back of the room. He says, how can you improve on yourself if you constantly quit?
Dungeon Master 00:17:43 And then he goes, Victor, here now. And you see he extends his hand and he sort of throws at these little fire cantrip lighting the sconces on the wall.
Dungeon Master 00:17:53 and the whole room gets lit um your eyes dart first at you see um your hands are cut into them like intricate arcane sigelry and runes but it's cut into your flesh so it's you've got dried blood and some of the wounds are fresh enough that they're still weeping a little bit loosely wrapped in like a bloody bandage
Dungeon Master 00:18:20 Your eyes continue to sort of scan down to up and you pass a mirrored finish. And I'm going to put you on the spot and ask, as a malnourished young teens like 1314 Leopold looks at his own reflection, what does he look like as a human?
Leopold Magnus 00:18:42 Oh, very interesting. Yeah, so you'll notice, of course, the sigils that have been etched into the skin, but he's fairly scrawny, maybe about five, two, definitely malnourished.
Leopold Magnus 00:18:59 red fire hair and light blue eyes. And you'll notice that he does appear to be of elven descent, almost more full elven blood than what you generally expect to see in the today times.
Dungeon Master 00:19:20 Nice. Your face sort of covered in dirt and sweat. Your hair is sort of matted as it hits your forehead on the side of your face from just how much you were straining and chanting the whole time. And then your eyes continue moving and you're looking and you're in this lab workshop training space all sort of together. And as your eyes hit the back of the room that was previously dark, you see your brother...
Dungeon Master 00:19:48 suspended perfectly perfect form upside down in a handstand on his fingertips his body
Leopold Magnus 00:19:55 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:19:57 lean, muscular scarred as he has been beaten and fought his whole life. He's got contrary to you, his eyes are yellow, red, almost like embers set into coal. He has never been nice. You guys have a relationship that's sort of secret, but outwardly he's a very violent child. He's older than you by a few years, but not many.
Cyrus Schwert 00:20:01 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 00:20:21 And you realize, again, this is through a memory or a dream, something you didn't know you could remember. You don't remember knowing that he was in the room with you. In the back of the room that was previously dark, he's just been in a perfect handstand for who knows a amount of time. You realized that the sound that you had heard almost like a dripping water in the background as you were concentrating is like sweat dripping off of his body and hitting the floor.
Dungeon Master 00:20:49 He, in like a backwards scorpion, lowers his frame very slowly until his toe touches the ground. And then his whole body whips up. And he sort of hulks towards you and stands in line with you to the side in front of this master of yours. And he...
Dungeon Master 00:21:08 smiles, a crude smile. And he goes, Victor, how is it that we can attain our goals if you threaten to get yourself thrown in the hole daily? We have worked too hard on this. And we cannot be met with failure, not by neither of you. And he looks over at you. And he just says, in short sentences...
Dungeon Master 00:21:32 One perfecting the arcane and one perfecting will and power. One goal. Do not fail. He looks at Victor again. Victor, if you maim or kill any more children, I swear to the gods, I'll replace your brain with a powered core. Dismissed. And then your...
Dungeon Master 00:21:55 memory fades, you sort of go into a deep dream space. And as you come back into stasis, you see something that is very particularly odd. Standing, not in front of you, but almost looming over you, what was your unconscious form, is your steel defender bone crusher, unmoving.
Dungeon Master 00:22:22 In his hand is your searing saber, but it's not on. From deep within his helm, you see a flickering yellow, red eyes, almost like coals burning. If he is not doing anything, he's just standing over watching you. What does Leopold do? You look down at metallic gauntlet, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:22:42 Yeah, it just like takes a large gas, just kind of, and like looks at his hands. And there, of course, like, yeah. Yeah. And kind of pans around and then realizes that bone crusher standing over the top of his shoulder there, kind of spins around, takes a step or two back, and just kind of inspects bone crusher closely.
Leopold Magnus 00:23:08 Not necessarily sure what to make of it, maybe starting to piece it together, but definitely just more unsettled than knowing what to do about the whole thing.
Dungeon Master 00:23:20 Yeah, I mean, unsettled to be around it for sure. You just hear the faint thrum of the arcane sourced from you in your body. It still feels under your control. You reach for your sword and there's no objection. You just take it out of its hand. And it almost seems like it's inactive, but like you call your will to move it to attention. You sort of will it to move and it sort of looks up at you ready for your command. So like,
Dungeon Master 00:23:50 normal as far as you can tell you spend you spend some time early hours of the morning it's first against like two or three thirty at this point you start doing a little bit of tinkering before you finish out your rest
Leopold Magnus 00:23:54 Interesting. Yeah, I'll kind of just maybe take a peek under the hatch there. You know, I've been tinkering and trying to make improvements. And maybe I can just see if there's anything odd going on and his gears.
Cyrus Schwert 00:24:07 Well.
Dungeon Master 00:24:18 Nothing different about the, like, Steel Defender, unless give me an Arcona check. I'll say on a wild success, you can notice something. I mean, it's a wild success. I just didn't think I was going to. Cool. I'm happy to give this to you. I just didn't think I was going to.
Leopold Magnus 00:24:30 All right. Oh, baby. How about a natural 20?
Cyrus Schwert 00:24:43 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:24:47 You're like, you've got his helm up and his armor sort of taken apart and you're sort of working through the tinkered gears that you used to create it. And you see the original power core that you pulled out of that war forged that had been sort of dying on the outside of the dome, the one that has the Lord of Advancements initials written into it. You see that that core has sort of gotten more powerful.
Dungeon Master 00:25:14 It seemed to like taken in some energy. You also notice that your sword, which was also crafted from a power source of that original war forged, seems to be linked with your steel defender's core, like the powers feeding off of each other. All without your doing.
Leopold Magnus 00:25:15 Interesting. Okay, very interesting.
Leopold Magnus 00:25:38 Yeah, I'll file it away and make some quick sketches and maybe brainstorming some ideas that might be useful later.
Dungeon Master 00:25:49 Right. Finish out your stasis. Morning comes to all of you. You get your long rest. And now what you guys like to do with your day?
Cyrus Schwert 00:26:04 Oh, nice, no, nothing to your dreams going on over here. Miami expresses my dreams. My dreams. Oh, and milked in it's it, right?
Zariel Torgan 00:26:13 Yeah, same here. Nothing. Tell me about it. What's going on?
Leopold Magnus 00:26:14 Oh, I didn't sleep very well, to be honest with you guys. It was just very restless. I had to work on bone crusher last night to soothe my mind, some nightmares. Oh, well, I'm not really sure what to make of it, but.
Dungeon Master 00:26:29 cowed and pipes up and goes, what do you mean?
Leopold Magnus 00:26:44 I think I might be remembering who I was, you know, before this, and then I'm just staring at my metal hands again. It's a different life. Oh, but enough about me. How are you all?
Cyrus Schwert 00:27:10 I'm doing just fine. Should we hit an Irish goodbye or should we? Let's ditch this turtle. Say good morning to Cornelia. Should we wait? I say we call it at 4 p.m. and then we just go.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:10 Yep, pretty well. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:27:23 Oh, I'm not sure he wakes up very early. I think he sleeps in quite late. He's fairly old and he's a turtle, so.
Dungeon Master 00:27:37 It's so long. No, you guys are, you guys are like in an ADU. You're like off, off property a little bit. You're not in the same area as them. He's in his house.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:44 Do we see him anywhere? Do we smell breakfast on the morning? His show? That's his home.
Cyrus Schwert 00:27:46 I can say, do we hear on. Oh. He's in his house. He's in his house.
Leopold Magnus 00:27:54 We just see a shell. Yeah, his head and his arms are all pulled in. It's just this shell. Yeah, exactly. It's right.
Dungeon Master 00:28:08 He's in his house, in his house. No, you had already asked him all the questions, I believe. He didn't know anything more, really.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:13 I guess we go over and didn't he have information for us for the hag? Didn't he give us a general direction?
Leopold Magnus 00:28:27 Oh, right.
Dungeon Master 00:28:30 He told you, no, because he had said that she sort of came to him originally when he had like, like fallen on an adventure by himself, lost up in the north. And she sort of just like showed up out of nowhere. And like, she just came to him. And then you also, I forget who went down when it happened. But one of you almost felt like you came in contact with.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:48 Oh, she's like ethereal. Gotcha.
Dungeon Master 00:29:01 the hag yourself before you were brought back from death. So there seems to be some sort of connection with between the planes as you transition in this hack. But he didn't know why not. He just kind of told you. Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:13 Oh, Zario, you're trying to find the hag? You just have to edge me a little bit. Beat. Beat me up real good. You know, I found the hag while I was off dying. So all you have to do is really, really put me down.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:19 Well, I mean... Well, let's see if we can't get somebody else to do it first. This isn't some sort of metaphor, is it?
Cyrus Schwert 00:29:26 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:40 Then bring me back and then put me down and bring, you know, maybe I can have a good conversation in the meantime. What? Oh, uh. I haven't been watching. What? It's very impish.
Dungeon Master 00:29:52 Those pictures, Trace put in the chat are good. Oh, Travis did. Yeah, it makes Leopold a cherub.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:58 I'll check them out.
Cyrus Schwert 00:30:03 Credit for all of them is don't. Yeah, there's other options, but they're all childlike for sure. Not very teenish. You know. I made an alternate virus. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:09 I kind of like that, but, you know, an adult. That's child. That's child, Leo.
Cyrus Schwert 00:30:36 Did we say goodbye to the turtle or? I'd put him in Air Jordan. I thought he's wearing two months. All right, let's walk in. See if Courtney Elise is awake. He's been good to us, though. We walk into his private home.
Dungeon Master 00:30:39 Oh, is that your guy? Yeah, you did. He's got the fucking sneakers. He comes out. He comes out.
Zariel Torgan 00:30:40 Yeah. That's so funny. Yeah. That's so funny. Yeah, we'll go sit back. Yeah, we don't knock.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:53 You put him in air, Jordan.
Dungeon Master 00:31:06 You walk into his home. You see he's like putting on a robe just over his form. Pitching a turtle tent, you know. He just, you know, sort of leaning on any surface as he can because he lost his staff. He just goes, good morning to you.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:13 He's hiding his turtle dick. Gigantic fucking... Good for his age. Just shitty wooden staff.
Cyrus Schwert 00:31:14 His dick is huge. Can we get a role for how big his dick is? Hey, I gave him my old quarter staff. He has the staff.
Dungeon Master 00:31:40 You see, it's nowhere to be seen. He looks around. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I definitely misplaced it. Yeah, go for it.
Cyrus Schwert 00:31:47 I'm holding my, my, his, I guess. Where, where's your staff? It looks so hard to walk without one. The perception check. Can I look for the staff with a perception check or something? I hand him my other spare. Where's your staff, dude?
Zariel Torgan 00:32:15 I feel like we just rolled in and stole this guy's shit. And he's like, it's like elder abuse. Hmm. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:32:20 You see, it's like in the umbrella holder in like the corner not being used. Donation file. Hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 00:32:25 It's like we got label with Goodwill on it. Well, we did. We were gifted stuff for saving this village. So, like, we just rolled in and stole his belonging. We earned it. I was promised. I thought he did. I only feel a little guilty when he laid gloriously walks. And I like try to pocket
Dungeon Master 00:32:50 um can you what um um you see he's got some lint on the table and some spare coins on the counter i just got hand over food thank you let's fucking go um
Zariel Torgan 00:32:53 Mm-hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 00:32:55 of some sort what kind of chat she's hanging around that's not good job that's fucking um
Dungeon Master 00:33:20 He's got some, like, fine nuts loosely set on, like, the chair, some beads. Like, they're not at all organized, but they're just sort of, like, in a pile. And then he's got, like, herbs and spices and stuff in his little enchanting area.
Cyrus Schwert 00:33:28 I'm gonna shake my head. I'm gonna shake my head disappointingly looking at those pine nuts. Those just will not do. I toss them all, brush them off.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:49 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:33:50 You see, like, he brushes him off the side like you couldn't see him. Please, have a seat. His eyes widened. If you remember, he was a huge fan of the roasted almonds to begin with. It was this for me.
Cyrus Schwert 00:34:02 I, of course, hand in my mug, this time steaming almond milk. Yes. Absolutely, sir. No better way to wake up in the morning.
Dungeon Master 00:34:24 takes an enjoying drink of it. And he asked you just sort of, where are you off to after this?
Cyrus Schwert 00:34:37 I don't know. Our adventure. I'm just here for the ride. Back home? There's going to be, like, chaos at the dome. It's a while, but, like, when looking away, it was going to be crazy.
Zariel Torgan 00:34:39 Yeah. That was our original task. Not that one. Oh, yeah. So.
Leopold Magnus 00:34:41 Oh, well, to the dome, right? Moonhaven Dome.
Dungeon Master 00:34:57 You guys didn't tell them about that.
Cyrus Schwert 00:35:05 It seemed like there's hole in the dome or something. There's like wolves running everywhere. It's kind of wild. Zareal's pets or pets families are just running amok. They're trying to find these dogs. It seems like they were a portrait. I mean, your friend told us to come find you guys. We didn't really say what to do after that. Do we have, maybe we could just live a nice life out here.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:15 Yeah. Yeah. There's a good chance that's accurate. But I don't think...
Dungeon Master 00:35:29 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:35:34 We live in this town. I mean, I do feel at home, I will say. Us as the normal ones and then everybody else. We shall take over and colonize. Oh, yeah. We're going to take over this place. That sounds fun. Absolutely not. Okay. What? He asked us a question. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:50 No, ha ha.
Leopold Magnus 00:35:51 Are we saying this all in front of the turtle?
Cyrus Schwert 00:36:06 We won't really do that. Nice tent, by the way. Well, we did find you. We got through the dungeon. We saved this village. We did learn something about the hag. Home is not looking well. Maybe it's time we start headed back if that's what the plan is for the crew.
Dungeon Master 00:36:33 You see Caledon uncharacteristically quiet sort of nudges Zarya and he goes, I think you should tell them our mission. Duh.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:43 Yeah, that's a good point. Thank you, Callan. You sound just like yourself. That was impressive. We actually left originally because we're going to the North Dome. That's our mission. Now, I understand wanting to go back home, but wouldn't make much sense to send us all this way. Now, at least have something to report.
Cyrus Schwert 00:36:52 Okay. We were in this house. We were in the Southville. Okay. Understood. Well.
Dungeon Master 00:37:07 And...
Zariel Torgan 00:37:14 Yeah. So that's, that's my vote.
Cyrus Schwert 00:37:23 Well, we are adventures now, ain't we? Pat Cyrus Hart on the back. I don't have anywhere to go. Besides here. And I guess with you guys. And these guys are weird. You look like side-eyed Cornelius. Like, not you, Cornelius. You're pretty...
Dungeon Master 00:37:43 He's like, he's like, his like clawed fingers picking, trying to pick up a bead, and he seems just really distracted. No, I got it. He holds on his hand. You drop it. He goes like between his claws.
Cyrus Schwert 00:37:52 Can I help you with that? Pick up. Let me just show you. Okay. That makes sense. Well, I guess you've been, y'all have been kind enough to take us in and welcome us to the party so far. If you, uh, won't mind, I think we'll tag along.
Zariel Torgan 00:38:06 Hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 00:38:23 I am desperately worried about my almonds back home, but we seem to be on a very important mission. So I'll help where we're needed. The almond flag. It's like kind of post-apocalyptic, like really, it's probably current apocalyptic, not even post yet. So like,
Leopold Magnus 00:38:38 Oh, well it's excellent to have you around.
Cyrus Schwert 00:38:52 Normally I'm going to go there. And out here is scary. I'll stay with my adventuring party. I'm an adventurer now. Big and strong. All right. Well, Cornelia seems like we best get going. The pleasure. Thank you for.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:05 Hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 00:39:21 our rewards and hopefully the village stays strong now that the threat is hopefully permitted.
Dungeon Master 00:39:30 He was sort of waiting to respond because, like, you had mentioned that North Dome was your goal, but then, like, quickly sidetracked to being concerned about your almonds and stuff. So, like, he didn't want to interrupt, obviously, but he sort of fills in backlog in the conversation. Be careful heading through the forest, of course, unsightly threats there. I haven't.
Dungeon Master 00:39:58 been to the dome myself, but it's well known our people. Best of luck to you for all your help. And he goes, don't, don't you worry about us. I may be a whole draught back, but I can still hold my own. And he, like, goes for his staff before realizing he doesn't have it anymore.
Cyrus Schwert 00:40:05 appreciate the warning it's in the it's in the
Zariel Torgan 00:40:26 Ha ha ha ha ha. Ha ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.
Dungeon Master 00:40:27 sort of clenches his hand because the threat seems to a bit scattered. Cute.
Cyrus Schwert 00:40:34 I noticed the open hand and I run and get the quarterstaff from the corner. Oh, this. This is what you're looking for, right? Be careful now. I lick an almond and stick it on. Now has a little pendant. What is with your almonds? What? It's obviously like my one character.
Leopold Magnus 00:40:55 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:41:01 You hear Chip goes. Wow. What?
Zariel Torgan 00:41:03 Ha ha ha.
Cyrus Schwert 00:41:04 No, but I'm here. You have, like, the main two milks. All right. You have, like, the main two milks. What are you? You're like a cow and you have a almond. Like, all you need left is... Well, I would say I'd like to see you try to milk me, but I really would not. So, we'll stick to almonds. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:29 Well, where are the nipples on an almond anyways? Always wondered. Oh, where are the nipples on an almond? Anyhow.
Dungeon Master 00:41:36 You asked the right question.
Kaladen Shash 00:41:39 I don't know what I.
Cyrus Schwert 00:41:39 Hold on, say it again, sorry. Beopold, can you repeat that? Only experience will tell. Rod Cyrus, I pat him way too hard. It's like in a gross spot. What's the phrase?
Zariel Torgan 00:41:52 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:42:05 It's like in the almond equivalent of a gooch. Welcome, Bren. Welcome, Bren.
Leopold Magnus 00:42:09 Oh, uh-huh. Small udders, huh?
Cyrus Schwert 00:42:09 Yeah, it's in the gooch of the almond. You know how an almond kind of looks like it has wrinkles? Inside the wrinkles, there's many udders. It's like folds on a pug's shnout. Well, have you looked at an almond lately? I hold up a real small...
Kaladen Shash 00:42:27 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:42:34 Yeah, and I hold up my arm and like a series of magnifying glasses come out, kind of one after another, bigger to smaller, and I start taking a real close look. Oh, there are some nipples here. Yeah. Oh, okay.
Dungeon Master 00:42:35 Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Ha ha.
Cyrus Schwert 00:42:45 I always pulls out of water. Here's the juice. Well, these are the steer almonds. They don't have odors here, dumb ass. These ones are just for meat. These are just, these are for eating. These are eating almonds. I got, Cyrus. This guy thinks I bring my milk and almonds. What's the food.
Leopold Magnus 00:43:03 Eating almonds. Yes, yes, that makes sense.
Kaladen Shash 00:43:07 I don't know what I walked into. You're here. Hey, guys. I don't know what you're talking.
Dungeon Master 00:43:07 Um, oh, man. Oh, man. It was really good.
Cyrus Schwert 00:43:15 while traveling. Okay. Can we just leave? I'm so done with that. Hi, Brad. Oh, what you've been here? Oh, what? You've been here the whole time. That's true. Oh, what? You've been here the whole time. That's true.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:32 Hey.
Leopold Magnus 00:43:34 Hey, man, at a perfect time.
Kaladen Shash 00:43:36 I don't know what the milking is about. I'm very confused. I was just standing in menu. You guys thought I was there the whole time. I was just kind of in menu.
Dungeon Master 00:43:37 um um um cletus um to start your day off who do you give your roasted almond to the day who gets the blessed one
Cyrus Schwert 00:44:00 Ruin the surprise, why don't you? Let's see. All right, well, I look at the almonds that I had put inside the staff and I, traveling out, and I say, Leopold, let's get to know almonds a little better, how about? And I stick it in his pocket.
Dungeon Master 00:44:04 Well, you got to do it. It's like a ritual thing. One person gets it at the start of each day. You got to pick.
Zariel Torgan 00:44:25 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:44:27 Now, we are now bonded via roasted almond. We're now bonded. Read what happens while you're bonded. You can munch on it later. It becomes your heart. Yeah, just stuff it in a crevice. It gets in the armor somewhere.
Leopold Magnus 00:44:33 Roasted almond bond. Okay. You just put it into my hollow chamber.
Dungeon Master 00:44:35 You picked a suit of armor and said you put it in his pocket. You put it in there.
Kaladen Shash 00:44:55 What does that count us?
Cyrus Schwert 00:44:57 All right, so while the bond lasts, whenever you are subjected to a speller magical effect that restores hit points, the bonded creature also receives the benefits. I can bond with a different creature whenever I finish a long rest, as long as the creature's willing. Bond ends if either creature travels to a different plane of existence or I switch to a different one. And I can also do something when I invoke the almond.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:06 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 00:45:08 Cool.
Cyrus Schwert 00:45:26 The bonded creature hits a target with an attack rule. You can use your reaction to invoke the almond power if you are within 60 feet of the bonded creature. The bonded creature's attack is then turned into a crit. Crazy. Once an almond has been invoked, it's assumed and a new almond can't be invoked again until the next day. That's actually...
Kaladen Shash 00:45:38 Oh, wow. All right. Long rest.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:38 Damn.
Leopold Magnus 00:45:41 So what was the one with the crit again? Oh. Oh. Yeah, very solid.
Dungeon Master 00:45:51 If you are the person he's bonded to and you're within 60 feet, he can turn any one attack into a grit by activating it. Well, the rest of the staff is pretty sick, actually, but I'll let him do that one on his own pace. He just has to pick the omit at the start of the day.
Cyrus Schwert 00:46:01 Yeah. That's wild. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Not used at the start of the day. All right. Now, I hope you're a little closer to the almonds now.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:06 Crazy that this almond theme item was a stock item.
Kaladen Shash 00:46:25 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:46:26 No, that's all right. That's why I said. Okay. You get an old. You get an old wrinkled shake from his clod hand.
Cyrus Schwert 00:46:36 All righty. I think we shake Cornelius's hand and.
Dungeon Master 00:46:53 We should do the best again. And you guys make your way out. And again, as you leave Cottonwood, it's sort of a very idealic place right on the edge of the forest built into the large trees as it gets in there. The animal folks sort of wave to you as you go by. You see that like everybody that you had met and talked to all the animal folk that like ran the shop and everything.
Kaladen Shash 00:47:02 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 00:47:22 give you just like a little bit of a nod. And unless you guys make any stops, it'll be pretty easy to get you out of there.
Dungeon Master 00:47:30 Even Wesley, you see like he's with his family, gives you just like a head nod and then just an awkward transition as you guys make your way. We had left it at, did you guys want to go through the forest? Or if you're looking in the map, did you want to go around the forest, sort of on the edge of Paradise Lost Desert and the Chiari Rung Forest? Or did you want to go through it? How did you want to break this on?
Zariel Torgan 00:48:00 Well, I'm always for more conflict. Yeah. I love that new picture. I love that new picture.
Cyrus Schwert 00:48:03 Assumingly through the forest would be the fastest way. Seems to leave. I worked really hard.
Kaladen Shash 00:48:04 But the most, is that also imply the most dangerous way? Okay, cool cool.
Dungeon Master 00:48:11 Mm-hmm. Cornelius had mentioned that it was pretty dangerous.
Zariel Torgan 00:48:32 It's fantastic.
Cyrus Schwert 00:48:36 It's pretty good. I like how I have sticks, four legs, two arms than that. Yeah, nothing.
Dungeon Master 00:48:48 Okay, oh, dears, who is leading the group? And also, I'm going to take a quick smoke break right at 9 and to say, goodnight to Hannah. If you guys want to Phil Brennan on, or I guess it doesn't have to be you guys. If Leopold, if you want to tell Bren about your dream, feel free. But we've got five minutes until then anyway. First and foremost, who is leading the first sort of leg on the...
Dungeon Master 00:49:14 Like the exploring aspect. So it'll be a couple checks. You'll roll a survival check as you make your way out. Depending on how that goes, you'll roll an encounter check. If it's a medium role, not bad enough for immediate encounter, there'll be a weather check in place of that to sort of see how much progress you make. You are pretty far away, so you'll need a lot of successes in a row. And then obviously anything you want to do in between, let me know.
Kaladen Shash 00:49:19 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:49:30 Who has a good survival? How to post like that? Is there really plus eight or something like that? Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:46 Oh, I got a pretty good survival. Plus eight. Yeah, I got plus eight. Should I go? All right. Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:49:48 I'll be pretty middle of the pack, I think.
Cyrus Schwert 00:50:01 Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. They're not long. Oh, geez. Hey, it's a nine. Yeah. We step on a nuclear. There's no way. Serial rolls that. You got to roll it again.
Dungeon Master 00:50:13 Give me an encounter tech. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:50:17 That's the survival track?
Zariel Torgan 00:50:31 Um, nine.
Cyrus Schwert 00:50:34 It was the same result. It's a way to get there. It's just a one.
Leopold Magnus 00:50:41 We all rolling. So what's happening?
Dungeon Master 00:50:46 No, a little more ironic and fun. As you guys are leaving Cottonwood, you haven't made it outside of city limits. You are sort of on the path, you hear howling and snarling. And the first thing you see is...
Kaladen Shash 00:50:59 turned around.
Cyrus Schwert 00:51:07 No way.
Dungeon Master 00:51:12 like some smoke rising from like the tree line a little bit and this like hyena canine type creature jumps and lands on one of the roofs and you see the thatching breaks underneath its weight a little bit as it's like snarling. Everybody roll initiative as you are getting into this fight before you leave to happen.
Leopold Magnus 00:51:30 Well, it's a good thing we're still here. Well, low on the roll.
Cyrus Schwert 00:51:40 Shout out to the two crew.
Kaladen Shash 00:51:47 Did the same thing last week.
Dungeon Master 00:51:55 Okay. Up first, Calladin. What do you want to do? Your order on the map, by the way, isn't necessarily order. It's just what I had generally picked. So put yourself where you think you would actually be. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:52:13 God. Good. Godspeed.
Kaladen Shash 00:52:17 distance we've got about 40 45 feet to the hyena thing
Zariel Torgan 00:52:23 Hey, Jonathan. Hey, so the power just came back on. So I got to take like 20 minutes and go shut off all the generators and switch everything. So I'll be back. All right, y'all, I'll try to be quick. All right, bye.
Dungeon Master 00:52:33 Okay. We'll take a break in a couple minutes anyway, so that's fine. He said like the last three or four days.
Cyrus Schwert 00:52:45 You know, the hyena looks fucking foul. Like load gas into generators to keep the resort lit. Basically. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:52:52 That's tough. How long have you had not had power? Woo. Oh, my goodness. All right. I'm going to run forward enough feet to be able to use lightning lore, and I'm going to rip it off the roof.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:57 Oh my god. That's a lot of a lot of diesel.
Cyrus Schwert 00:53:14 It is something I mean that. Yeah. Yeah. I'm making.
Kaladen Shash 00:53:19 15 feet towards me if it hits. It's a strength check. No, sorry, it's a, it's a save. You're looking for a strength save. DC 15. Okay, it just passes that.
Dungeon Master 00:53:25 Oh, okay. It's a rule to hate, you said? Drink, save. It's not one of its best things. That is a dirty 20 with a natural 18. Wow, really, dirty 20.
Cyrus Schwert 00:53:51 deployed one of your pictures. Yeah, how are doing? Well, did it and what?
Kaladen Shash 00:53:51 And I don't. Yep. So no damage because it's the can trip. That's a bummer. That's fine. Let's just trying to rip them off the roof and then I'll beat them up. No, that was it. I took it over here.
Dungeon Master 00:54:08 All right. Anything else on your turn? Okay. We'll do Cyrus's turn, and then we'll call it a quick break because then it's the Null's turns. But Cyrus, what do you want to do real quick?
Cyrus Schwert 00:54:27 How tall is the building? Like how high is he? Like just I think I'll just like I think I'll just like run to the edge of the building and like wait for somebody else like
Dungeon Master 00:54:31 um 10 feet i would say to the top of the roof and he's like halfway up so somewhere between like 8 and 10 feet near
Cyrus Schwert 00:54:57 if we're going to do this like strategically altogether like i'm not just going to push him by myself but i'll like hold my action for when we're ready to push this guy basically yeah
Dungeon Master 00:55:08 Okay. Then I'll let you sort of use this brief moment to like verbally coordinate with the group or you guys still probably have your telepathic bond up because it's kind of constant unless you want to break it. But you could sort of start a conversation if you want.
Cyrus Schwert 00:55:30 We got to, let's push this guy from all sides so we can't just swing down on us. And that's it. I guess. Come with me. My voice isn't that.
Kaladen Shash 00:55:43 So.
Dungeon Master 00:55:47 Okay. Okay, cool. I'm going to still have my headphone, and so if you ask me questions, I can answer it when I get back.
Leopold Magnus 00:55:57 Oh, you're having some soft tissue issues over there, Cyrus? Oh, you think you may have swallowed an almond the wrong way. Oh, how did that work? You know, considering you're on a nut farm.
Cyrus Schwert 00:56:01 My throat was weird for a second. It was kind of hard to talk. Yeah, long ways. Oh, he's deathly allergic to nuts. Yeah, I can't eat that. I can't joke. I can't do that. Just the opposite. Don't even joke. Don't even joke around like that.
Kaladen Shash 00:56:20 Oh, I love that. I love that.
Cyrus Schwert 00:56:31 you shouldn't say that about me it's actually really offensive he's really easily offended i don't wish i played a whiff on my clarinet
Leopold Magnus 00:56:38 Oh, what a, what a nut. Nailed it. Yeah, so, Bryn, I guess to update you about the dream sequence is that Leopold flashed.
Leopold Magnus 00:57:00 to being in a basement. And he is concentrating on some kind of enchantment, kind of focusing his arcane energy there before losing focus and cutting early. And at the same time, his killing machine brother, Victor enters into the chamber and is getting chastised by his mentor.
Leopold Magnus 00:57:27 which we've previously seen described, for trying to kill somebody that bested him in a fight, in a clean fight. He just tried to fight dirty and kill him. And that's when Leopold saw his own personal reflection in the mirror as a human, which is...
Leopold Magnus 00:57:48 what Cyrus put in the chat here, albeit that image is a bit more impish. But yeah, I describe myself as having fire red hair, being almost full elf with blue eyes. And then the arcane sigils are carved into my skin, bleeding, kind of oozing, some healed, some not, and also just malnourished, underfed, and kind of
Kaladen Shash 00:57:52 Go.
Leopold Magnus 00:58:16 like almost like been kept against my will in a basement so yeah that was pretty much it and then uh you know definitely older uh than like a child's aged but not not necessarily like you know full full adult maybe like adolescent you know uh young adult yeah yeah exactly
Kaladen Shash 00:58:23 How old? How old did you look to yourself? Okay. Are you a teenager or late teenager of sorts? Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:58:44 And then when I flashed back to the, you know, like waking up for my dream, Bone Crusher was ominously standing over my shoulder with my sword in his hand. And I decided to inspect him a little bit and come to find out the power core inside Bone Crusher and the power core inside my sword had some kind of connection. So...
Kaladen Shash 00:59:01 Okay. Okay. So that's good. Some good background came out.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:13 was very very interesting yeah yeah definitely like uh yeah definitely like uh what's it all mean
Kaladen Shash 00:59:37 That's fun. So your real lineage is elf. So let's go. We've got some good, got some elves in the group. Right. All right. Yeah. Good. Good.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:45 Yeah. And then that's an interesting thing about that is like Jonathan was saying, full elves are fairly unusual. Everyone's like, you know, kind of been interbred. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:00:09 That's cool. And then you guys were just like talking to like town members as we all left, essentially. And then just showed up for the discussion about milking, milking almonds. Yeah, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:15 Yeah, we talked to, we talked to Cletus. Or not Cletus. What was that case name? The turtle.
Kaladen Shash 01:00:45 There you go. I'm finally seeing the pictures. That's good. That's Cyrus. That's Cyrus's new, like, picture. That's sweet. He got like,
Leopold Magnus 01:00:57 Yeah. But that's pretty much it. And then we're trying to leave town here. And of course, you saw that we got ambushed. Got us Jordan's on.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:14 These guy Jordan's on, yeah. So I was looking at it. Yeah. I don't understand the last picture that's in the chat. Is that supposed to be like Leopold? Or?
Dungeon Master 01:01:17 Funny. That is... That is... That's cleed us giving Leopold a roasted almond. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:39 Oh, that's them giving the almond, the almond of goodwill or whatever. Yeah, he's like a centaur cow. It missed it. It's just, yeah. It was pretty fun. It was that silver moon.
Leopold Magnus 01:01:40 An almond. Yeah, yeah. But he's like a centaur cow. What the fuck? That's crazy. That's crazy.
Dungeon Master 01:01:55 How is trivia? Oh, shit? Right.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:10 There were some categories that were just really tough. There was just one where they just gave like a couple of sentences and they were like, what book was that? And they weren't like the most famous parts of the book. What are what? And some of them were just like, where the wild things are? Chris was like, I know this book. I've read it a million times. It's hilarious. He read it to his kids. Yeah. There were a couple others.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:14 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:02:29 I love where the while thing. That is crazy.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:35 There was a serial killer category that was surprisingly, like, terrifying. It was like, because I read all the facts and you had to guess what serial killer was. No. No. Because have you been to trivia before? They've done that before. Oh, man.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:47 Those guys go on a rant about the source. When he used to go, they would, like many, many times. I guess at the time they had gotten a bad review from the Ben Source magazine, and so they were really fired up about it. Like, they'd just continue to bring it up. They'd, like, make it categories. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:03:10 Yeah, the two guys that, that's great, they make a whole category of. You know, the two guys that ran it were pretty fun. No, I'm sure it is. It sounds like they've been doing it since after COVID. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:03:19 I'm guessing the same two dudes. I wouldn't expect them to... Yeah, yeah, that would be right.
Cyrus Schwert 01:03:32 Thank you, Dan.
Dungeon Master 01:03:37 when I started my Diablo character too. Damn you. So I'm so bad. I'm like 18. No, I started it at normal. Just kind of get the feel over the cross I wanted to play. No, I'm going to... I just...
Kaladen Shash 01:03:44 That's good, man. I think I just hit 50. I think, I feel like you'd be raging. Are you playing at hard difficulty right now? Oh, bump it, bump, bump, bump it to hard immediately. Like, that's how I got all the XP. You get like 1.5.
Dungeon Master 01:04:06 I wanted to make sure I knew what class I was going to play, and I'm going with the blood necromancer. It's pretty sick. Nice.
Kaladen Shash 01:04:12 That's pretty good. I think as I get to some higher levels, I'm going to do fire and ice. I like the, I think I like the way those two things will look on screen. The lightning's pretty freaking strong. That's why I did it again. But it is pretty fun to cast Blizzard a bunch. You know what's got yellow before? No one else? It's just a super fun button masher.
Leopold Magnus 01:04:13 Oh, I never did pick it up, but you guys play it all the time. Right.
Cyrus Schwert 01:04:35 The house. The house. I'll have enough.
Dungeon Master 01:04:35 I think we're the only ones. Yeah. Yeah, Dale, I hadn't played it in forever, so I had to refamiliarize myself with how it went. And at first, I didn't know what power was doing, what button. I forgot how to play.
Kaladen Shash 01:04:41 No, this is, I hadn't played it for like a year, a year and a half. It took me forever to be like, wait, how do I, like, what am I following? What am I doing? And I took me forever to find the little dungeons with, like, the dots for, like, whatever your class is. Oh, my gosh. So I just...
Leopold Magnus 01:04:44 Oh, okay. All right. So you guys are getting back into it.
Cyrus Schwert 01:05:06 in the middle of the wall. Wasn't listening to a direction.
Dungeon Master 01:05:06 The specific ones, yeah. I did a Hell Tight event. Got some good gear. Oh, hell yeah. Back to combat. You guys are ready. Oh, Jesse's not here.
Kaladen Shash 01:05:11 That's good. I did one really early on, like level seven. And I instantly went down and I just stayed dead for most of it. And then right at the end, someone picked me up. So I got all the credit. It was great. Yeah, it's fortunate.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:23 Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:05:36 I'll just wait for him a little bit. Mm-hmm. He is, you know, he's not up next, actually. So, Travis, if you want to do something on your turn. Oh, hell yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:05:40 He said like 20, it's been like 15-ish. What turn is? You turn? You turn. Got a rock.
Kaladen Shash 01:05:50 I dig it up a new hot pink rock I was pretty excited about that yeah
Dungeon Master 01:06:06 It's a great time of year to use it.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:07 Oh, a desk? Nice. Well, just pretty chill here.
Cyrus Schwert 01:06:12 Apparently was inspired by the little. Yeah, welcome. That's why I pulled it up. Like. Well, they're basically going to be all yours.
Kaladen Shash 01:06:25 Where'd you guys been up to all week? Just just waiting. Man, I've gotten to go snowboarding all day Monday because I just randomly took the day off like a month ago. And the snow ended up being really fun.
Cyrus Schwert 01:06:39 I've just been sitting on my desk, staring at my character sheet, waiting until the next time we played. Powder City.
Dungeon Master 01:06:39 Has it moved? Right. Good day to go. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:43 Oh yeah, you mentioned.
Kaladen Shash 01:06:55 And then I went Wednesday morning. Wednesday morning was fucking the base. Like the snow was like, it was really good, man. And it snowed like four more inches while I was there. And there was like absolutely nobody on the hill. Like this is the Outback. This is the Outback chairlift. It's just empty. There's no one coming down. You can see one skier.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:14 Hell yeah. That's great.
Dungeon Master 01:07:14 Really? Holy shit, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:07:24 I did that like for like two and a half hours Wednesday morning. It was rad. It was fantastic. Yeah. I only have the midweek pass. Monday was kind of a bummer. I got stuck on Cloud Chaser for a little while. But when we got to the top, they gave everyone like a little express lane pass like a cut the line pass thing. That's like a gate now. I'm going to.
Cyrus Schwert 01:07:25 Oh. Did you get the midweek pass again?
Dungeon Master 01:07:52 That's sick. Oh, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:07:54 I'm not going to use it because I'm never, I'm never there when it's stupid busy, right? I'm always there on the weekdays. I was going to give it to Sawyer, one of the aides right now. I guess he's kind of our lead aide right now. He just got accepted to OSU. Yeah, PT. Two of our aides just got accepted. Catherine and Sawyer. You're exciting for them.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:54 Oh, yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:08:00 Yeah. That's a PT. That's awesome.
Kaladen Shash 01:08:22 It also means we're going to at least the end of the summer. Hate it. We train good ones again. Yeah, man. That's usually what happens, honestly. It's like it's a job for like a year and a half, two years, and then everybody goes on to like their next best thing, which is good.
Dungeon Master 01:08:28 Yeah. Love training people. Yeah. That's cool.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:36 And I'm up to speed, but that's good for them going to school and skilling up. Right.
Cyrus Schwert 01:08:51 So that's cool for that. I was holding for a more coordinated effort for multiple people on different sides to get up. So, like, if we get up one of the time, like, we could all just, like, get opportunity attacked as we're climbing because that's, like, kind of a vulnerable position we're in. I was just hoping we all go up together, so I'm waiting for that time.
Kaladen Shash 01:08:52 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:08:55 Travis, did you want to do anything on your turn? Or are you still wanting to hold it? Just holding for that moment. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:08 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:09:19 I got once I go up, I want to like. Oh, okay. Oh, okay.
Dungeon Master 01:09:24 Well, as you hold after your turn, you see popping up from behind a broken piece of the fence that's been pushed in. There is another sort of null creature right here. And it will just take a stray shot that, oh shit, that's a natural point.
Kaladen Shash 01:09:52 Hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 01:09:57 He doesn't have an add to strength. It's like actually an ad one. That's crazy. Make sure we tell him when he gets here. Make sure we tell him when he gets here.
Dungeon Master 01:10:03 It was a 24 total, so I guess he doesn't have a good bonus. Seven turns to 14 damage to he can only hit the closest person, so he hits Zario for that damage. I've got all of your picture sheets pulled up. I can do the damage to him.
Kaladen Shash 01:10:24 Well,
Cyrus Schwert 01:10:28 That's so many. Attack the guy who's not here. Um, attack him. Attack him.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:33 Fuck that guy up.
Dungeon Master 01:10:34 Well, I realized that he doesn't have crazy range, so it would have to be the first one. And that's where he is on the map. After that, though, you have a chance to use your turn if you want, or if you still want to hold.
Cyrus Schwert 01:10:57 The guy on the ground. Should I go to... Should I hop up here? Should I go to the guy's shooting? Somebody tell me what to do. Okay, I'm close to this guy. I drive up onto the house. I try to...
Kaladen Shash 01:11:09 do what feels do it feels right
Dungeon Master 01:11:21 Okay. Half your movement decline the house. He's there. You can make your attacks. 25 hits.
Cyrus Schwert 01:11:27 Okay. Still, absolutely. Your chance. That's one. That's one. There's another. Is another two? No.
Kaladen Shash 01:11:47 Oh, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:11:53 17 also hit. 12 and 12, 24 damage, finish him.
Cyrus Schwert 01:12:06 I thought this was going to be intense. I slammed him with the blunt side of my sword and knock him straight into the house. Like a hammer hit a nail. Is he like kind of invented it? Unneeded property damage. I'm putting wood flat. What are the odds these animal folk got insurance?
Dungeon Master 01:12:25 Yeah, you just, he breaks through the bottom, fully unconscious. From deep down inside the broken house, you just hear, we didn't. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:12:36 The insurance companies dropped them because they were being attacked by the fire spirit too much.
Cyrus Schwert 01:12:38 I hope he's in your hands. That's just a big liability you should have dealt with. Okay, that's my turn. It's like California here.
Kaladen Shash 01:12:57 we're going we're going
Dungeon Master 01:12:58 100%. You see jumping up from behind cover right down here is another one that takes its turn. It doesn't get as good of a bonus. 13 to hit, and that'll be Cyrus because you just killed one of it, one of them.
Cyrus Schwert 01:13:10 Just keep building them. It does not.
Dungeon Master 01:13:29 I don't think a 13 hits, though. That's all it can do. After that, you see this one comes out from behind this rock that you hadn't seen. So it comes.
Cyrus Schwert 01:13:40 Oh, it hit me. I'm so dainty. One of these people? A lot of people.
Dungeon Master 01:13:52 From there to there, it'll take a bow shot. We'll hit Caledon because he's in line, but hasn't been shot at yet. That's only a 12, I imagine that misses. Okay, Leopold. Yes, sir.
Kaladen Shash 01:14:08 That's not a hit.
Cyrus Schwert 01:14:10 Sign us have both.
Leopold Magnus 01:14:14 To me? Oh, these things are so small. OK. Oh, man, they're far away. I will move my full movement. I get it to measure when I move. Jesus.
Leopold Magnus 01:14:46 35, 30 feet is my movement. Yep. Move in, and then I will do a frost ray. Ray frost on this. No.
Cyrus Schwert 01:15:07 Leaving me behind.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:16 for my action. 21 to hit. 10 damage. And then I think Bone Crusher's been following me around, right? He was out and about. So I will direct him with my bonus action to attack.
Dungeon Master 01:15:17 Null number three. 21 hits. 21 easily hits. Damn man. Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:15:46 Yeah, I'll put them on the map in a second, but go ahead and make an attack. 27 hits. Ooh, on death's door.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:50 And I'll just have them do a firebolt. 27 hits, I imagine. Another 11 damage. Bone crusher. That is my turn. Oh, thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:16:11 Yeah. Nice job, Leopold. Really? That's the power of almonds for you. That had nothing to do with almonds. That's disgusting.
Dungeon Master 01:16:16 Okay. This doesn't report. After that is Jesse's turn.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:23 He's frosty now. He's icicle. He's got snot icicles from my ray of frost.
Dungeon Master 01:16:44 So we'll skip it. And if he comes back after Cletus's turn, we'll go ahead. But after that, it's Cletus.
Cyrus Schwert 01:16:49 All right. Absolutely delicious. It's going to be 14.00. Sorry. Let's see. How far am I? Oh, I am far. Okay. I need to. Four years 30 feet. That is far. I am far away. Okay. I'm going to get, oops.
Dungeon Master 01:17:16 I said you could be wherever you wanted to be.
Cyrus Schwert 01:17:20 Well, that's fine. I'll use my 30 feet, get up on the bridge. That puts me... Okay, I can just hit the one on them. I'm gonna... I learn some things from the... Even though I already had this, never used it. I'm gonna produce flame. That's a bonus. Oh, it's an action. That's fine. That's fine.
Cyrus Schwert 01:17:50 I'm a produce flame in my hand. And I can't do anything with this round. And then I know bonus action, Shaleli, my staff.
Dungeon Master 01:18:05 you've done some fire sort of hovers in your hand kind of swarming in the center ready to do something you shall lily your club um we're just going to skip jessie's turn this turn this won't be a high enough stake fight to do anything that caldon's your turn at the top though
Kaladen Shash 01:18:24 I think I'm just going to move into the one that's the closest. I'll go towards the one at the rock. I'm just going to swing. Or as I run up, I'll do one of my soft trick blasts. Or is that there is. Dirty 20 hits, I think.
Dungeon Master 01:18:52 30 20 hit. Well, you kill it with the 4 damage, so don't, you don't have to waste your attack on it. Blow that one's head off as you run out. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:18:56 for four forced damage. Then I go ahead and swing a light splitter as I close the distance twice. Oh, that's it. Never mind. All right. Let's see how many feet that was. I used all my feet. I used everything good seat just to blow its head off. Since I killed it, I'll use another esoptic blast at the
Kaladen Shash 01:19:25 the other one right here no they're all separate separate 12 hit no yes okay that's it
Dungeon Master 01:19:31 Okay, the null hunter. You can use this. Oh, it's not the same hit, is it? Both missed it. Okay. After your turn,
Dungeon Master 01:19:56 exploding from inside the house, jumping through the roof, you see this large, muscular, like, overgrown-looking null. This is the noll pack lord, and he'll take... He can do two attacks. He'll do two Longvo attacks at the closest person, which is...
Dungeon Master 01:20:22 Caledon, and then he can use Insight Rampage. Recharges on a five or six. One preacher the Null can see within 30 feet of it can use its reaction to make a melee attack if it can hear the Null and has Rampage. That's none of them. Because none of them are in range, so he can't use that one, but he can do the two bow attacks. First one is that the NAP one. Second one.
Dungeon Master 01:20:54 I think he misses both times in just an utter fail of a turn. His foot kind of slips a little bit and his shot goes wide up in the air just off into the distance, nowhere near anything. He looks a little embarrassed. Cyrus, it's your turn again.
Cyrus Schwert 01:21:11 you measure for me to this guy um i run the closest guy i run the closest guy
Dungeon Master 01:21:40 30 feet you could get you'd be shy of the guy
Cyrus Schwert 01:21:44 there right there um yeah um i'll stay there um i'll stay there i guess and can i use an action to pull out my shield that i have on my back
Dungeon Master 01:22:12 Yeah. Objects interactions or free actions. It doesn't cost you anything. You can't gusts.
Cyrus Schwert 01:22:15 Does anything it takes an action to do that? Oh, damn. Like, I cast gusted this guy? I guess. Yeah. You have spells? I do.
Dungeon Master 01:22:43 Oh, what does that do? What do I do with that? On a five, on that strength, say he failed.
Cyrus Schwert 01:22:46 I do a strength save. And I can't, like, shoot air at him, basically. Take this. You should swing your sword to it. I swing my sword so hard getting ready to hit him, but I can't run fast enough. I swing through air. Let's go.
Kaladen Shash 01:23:05 Oh yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:23:20 on. This is fucking. I'm so sorry. Does it do damage? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can just make it just make him feel wind or put it.
Dungeon Master 01:23:35 We'd probably just push them, I made them. Well, does it do anything?
Cyrus Schwert 01:23:48 It doesn't do any fucking damage. Can I give a bonus action to fucking Aladin? Like, fucking dude, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I can do with this. I've never cast spells before. I'm like, this is hard. And you get a party. Then I'll turn to fucking end up.
Kaladen Shash 01:23:55 Okay. Hello.
Dungeon Master 01:24:07 He, the words coming out of his mouth are incredibly whining in and feeling betrayed by his spells. But you see he is like running and trips a little bit ahead of time and swings his sword. And he swings it so hard and so effectively like a visible gust of wind slams into the knoll and it kind of gets rocked for a second. And I think that's what inspires you more than anything.
Kaladen Shash 01:24:33 That's good. Is that a D6 or what are we at? D4. D8. Go.
Cyrus Schwert 01:24:38 They're very light. Oh, that's cool.
Dungeon Master 01:24:41 You got D8 already. The knoll with the lawn bow on the ground in front of you. He's just going to take his. He actually gets two attacks, but I didn't do that the first time. One at Cyrus, one at Caledon. Cyrus, one at Caledon. Cyrus, 14. Jesus, can't hit for shit. And Caledon 13. Both mess. This guy's going to use his movement.
Dungeon Master 01:25:09 To close the distance with Eusirus, and he will take a bite attack. I can't roll for a shit. That's a seven. That guy's dead. Taking that initiative. Leopold your turn.
Cyrus Schwert 01:25:16 That does not do. That does not in it.
Leopold Magnus 01:25:36 I'm over here muted. With my turn, I'm going to roll in. That guy's within range. Yeah. I'm going to move up behind this knoll and take a flanking position with Cyrus and just roll a hit with my laser sword. And is he looking pretty hurt?
Dungeon Master 01:26:08 That one hasn't been hit yet. But they don't look that strong to begin with. Okay. Roll the hit then. On lethal damage is possible.
Leopold Magnus 01:26:10 Okay. I will go ahead and just try to, if I am going to kill him, I'll try to maybe hold my punch and just kind of pull up a little bit before I finish them. If that's possible. Excellent. 16 to hit.
Cyrus Schwert 01:26:13 You got hit by wind. He's pretty hurt.
Dungeon Master 01:26:40 16 just hits. It would have a random. See if you create.
Leopold Magnus 01:26:42 Oh, I guess I would have advantage, right? Because I'm flanking. Yeah. Ooh, nope. All right, so 16 connects. It's all checked up. So then I will make a strike. 14 damage on that one, and then additional one fire damage.
Kaladen Shash 01:26:51 Ha ha ha.
Dungeon Master 01:27:11 15. Not dead, but hurt. 20 hits. Finish him. Well, I guess how do you reduce them to one hit?
Leopold Magnus 01:27:13 And then a 20 to hit, 9 damage, and then an additional 6th. Yeah, and then I'll call out to Bone Crusher, and I'll say, Bone Crusher, get in here and finish off this foul beast. He'll come running. And then he'll do a force-enpowered rend.
Leopold Magnus 01:27:45 I think he would have advantage because he's flanking with me. Okay, so he can't get advantage. Ah, all right. Bone crusher swings wide. And that's my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:27:50 He would have to be where Cyrus is to flank with you. No, somebody, because he technically can't be right there. He'd be right there. So there'd have to be somebody across from him. Miss on that one.
Dungeon Master 01:28:16 Did you have more movement on your turn? Because you could have just stepped backwards and he could take your spot. Or you could have rotated around and he got it into my game. Sure, yeah. So go ahead and just roll that second one to see if you hit. Yeah, okay. I think minimal damage does it.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:21 Oh. Yeah, I think I have at least a foot or two. All right. Hey, 22 would hit. He'll...
Cyrus Schwert 01:28:39 Pondolin just so cool. Gross. Now who's going to clean that up? Now, who's going to clean that up?
Leopold Magnus 01:28:43 get in there with his sword, slice him down for seven damage, cutting the knoll from shoulder to hip diagonally. It just slides apart, intestines exposed. Bone Crusher wipes his blade on the coattails of Cyrus.
Dungeon Master 01:28:58 Nicely done.
Cyrus Schwert 01:29:12 It's fucking ew. What are you doing? That's my fucking coat. It's this two-legged hyena. The area is not clear bone crusher. Weird shit.
Leopold Magnus 01:29:19 He remarks area clear, area clear. Or wait, is this, is this an enemy over here? Oh, okay. All right, never mind. I thought they were, killed them all. Yeah, redacted, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:29:27 Yeah, there's two. He says redacted. Up next with the Jesse again, but he's still not here. What are his tantrip? He'll do a sacred flame.
Cyrus Schwert 01:29:47 You can really use them. All right. Well, that sounds much more useful.
Dungeon Master 01:29:57 at the closest one. He'll do it at the Hunter. It's a deck save DC16. It makes it with the 17. Nothing happens, I think, because it's just a cantrip.
Cyrus Schwert 01:30:24 Electricity in the pink. All right. All right. I'm a fashionably late move up to where Zaria was. I think. I think that puts me in. Yep.
Dungeon Master 01:30:25 Yeah, it is. That is it. Okay. But at least he tried something that turn and he'll reposition himself a little bit closer and up. Letis, your turn.
Cyrus Schwert 01:30:54 I'm going to huck this flame at the, uh, guy at the entryway. 18. Oh, fuck. Five damage. Oh, gosh.
Dungeon Master 01:31:01 Go for it. 18 hits. Good hit, you're not dead, obviously. Burns like a whole section of its shoulder, but the flame is quick to sort of distinct...
Dungeon Master 01:31:28 extinguish itself before doing anything else. Back up to the towel. Before you go, Caledon, somebody roll me a D4. We want that. For sure.
Cyrus Schwert 01:31:42 Who's doing it? I'll do it. We definitely won it high, right? It subtracts three of them, right? Just instantly. We haven't even made it out of the gates.
Kaladen Shash 01:31:54 Three more, three more, three more, three more, three, three more rolls rolling out.
Leopold Magnus 01:31:54 We want a high. Giant troll comes in.
Dungeon Master 01:32:04 You see. Damn it, let me select this. Three more Knowles rushed through the gates, snarling and howling as they come in.
Cyrus Schwert 01:32:11 This village sucks. A micro pig. Fucking moon being. Fucking moonbeam. Yeah. You laugh.
Leopold Magnus 01:32:27 Jesus Christ.
Dungeon Master 01:32:32 Calvin is your turn.
Kaladen Shash 01:32:37 Uh, yes, let me see here. Oh, yes. I'm going to run up to here.
Cyrus Schwert 01:32:46 I don't lose any creepy spells. So far away. I have 1030. About the other.
Kaladen Shash 01:33:05 And I'm going to cast Thunderwave. No, I'll do that at second. I'll do that at second level. It's just, it's going to be a con 15. Yeah. Correct.
Dungeon Master 01:33:11 Okay. What is the save? The con-save? Okay, hold on. There are two null hunters, one null, and one-null pack lord. Okay. So first up is the one-null. It's a con-save, right? First one is a six fails.
Cyrus Schwert 01:33:25 Oh, you're 30. I'm under the roof.
Kaladen Shash 01:33:39 Yeah. That's a pass. Success. That's a pass. Success. That's appeal.
Dungeon Master 01:33:40 The null pack lord gets a plus one. That is 19. And then two hunters. First one gets eight. Second one gets 14. So only the pack load makes the check.
Kaladen Shash 01:34:08 I'll put these off on the damage. That's all 11 thunder damage. What? It's half damage to the second level spell. And...
Dungeon Master 01:34:13 11 thunder damage. There. Is it half damage on a save or no damage? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:34:28 Instamance.
Kaladen Shash 01:34:37 And then a bonus action. I'm going to Misty step behind this rock.
Dungeon Master 01:34:49 Beautiful. Nice turn. After you is the guy on the roof. He is going to take his two bow attacks. He's not going to get in range. First one is going to be a 23, and that's against the steel defender. The second one's against you Leopold. Only in 19 to hit you.
Leopold Magnus 01:35:09 No, 19 doesn't hit Leopold. Yeah, 19 doesn't hit Leopold. Oh, damn.
Dungeon Master 01:35:20 Okay, but does the 23 hit your steel defender? Okay. That is 1D8 plus two damage. Three damage. After that it's fire.
Cyrus Schwert 01:35:39 I get rid of that. Okay. Do you buddy? I was fucking sorry. Can you take the mouse for me? Can you move me to, like, down here? Yep. Like.
Leopold Magnus 01:35:39 He's taken his lungs.
Kaladen Shash 01:35:57 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:36:06 Right there. And then I'll cast Wynnwall at these three people in a row. So they all roll strength saving throws. DC 14. If the three guys down, they'll shoot. So it's three of them, but yeah. Strength.
Dungeon Master 01:36:17 All of them. Gotcha, that guy, that guy, that guy. That guy. Okay, that's a hunter, a null, and a pack, Lord. What kind of save is it? Great, save. First one gets 19.
Cyrus Schwert 01:36:45 That passes. That fails. That also fails. Even if they pass, it still takes half. And it's 3D8. Oh, brutal.
Dungeon Master 01:36:47 The second one gets 12. And last but not least, a 13. Okay. Man, so 10. So it was fail, save, fail.
Kaladen Shash 01:37:09 Just liken yourself, very soft.
Dungeon Master 01:37:17 It was save fail, fail. So the first one takes half damage, so it takes five on death's door. And then the other two, this guy takes 10 and that guy takes. Ooh, also on death's door. Okay. Anything else on your turn?
Cyrus Schwert 01:37:22 Yeah. Damn it. All right. I guess I'll get as close as I can, so I move up. Like, I can't get all the way to them, like, to the gate. And that'll do it.
Dungeon Master 01:37:53 Nice. After that, it is the guy with 1 HP. He's got nothing left to lose, so he'll run to close distance with you. And he'll take two spear attacks. First one is a 19 to hit. Second one is a 9.
Cyrus Schwert 01:37:58 do anything really. Yeah. The plane. No, it does not.
Dungeon Master 01:38:23 Does 19 hit? Damn, what's your fucking, if he's 20? No. Damn. I'm fucking. I'm fucking hate it.
Kaladen Shash 01:38:31 Everybody's got, everybody's got giant armor classes. I love that, man. That's fucking awesome. We are so hard to hit. No, no, no. Cleetis, wait, what is Cleetus? Is it cleatis little? Yeah, we got to get that kit some armor. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:38:34 I have my shoe house. Yeah, we're all so large. I'm a big beefy boy. I have a 13 AC. I was desperate. I was desperate for some metal workers in this village. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:38:43 How can I know even, baby?
Kaladen Shash 01:39:01 The good woodworkers, very good woodworkers.
Dungeon Master 01:39:02 The no pack lord can only do 30 feet. So he'll run up to there, but he can't get in a melee, so he'll have to take a bow shot. Yeah, he doesn't have anything more than that. Okay. Natural 20. And...
Cyrus Schwert 01:39:20 That does. That also does.
Dungeon Master 01:39:31 23. Nice. Okay, so the net 20 will do, it's a D8 plus 2, so it's due 2D8 plus 4. So then it's a total of 3D8 plus 6. Pretty soft. You take 12 damage.
Kaladen Shash 01:39:44 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:40:00 that's that'll work augusta win here it figured it up the second time
Dungeon Master 01:40:00 One and two and a three on that damage. After that, it's Leopold.
Leopold Magnus 01:40:11 Oh, let's finish these guys. Oh, that old turtle, I'm not sure if he has any money left. And I'll come in. It looks like maybe there's a barrier here, so I don't know if I'll be able to get around to get some flanking.
Kaladen Shash 01:40:17 Cup data eaters off. Let's get some more money.
Leopold Magnus 01:40:37 I'll just put myself right there. And then I will attack with my searing saber, the one closest to me. Yeah, the one directly in front of me. The pack lord is that's his name. And 12 damage on that strike.
Dungeon Master 01:40:46 Which one directly in front are you? Okay, the pack lord. 27. Okay. He hits.
Cyrus Schwert 01:40:49 It's just changing. It goes right.
Leopold Magnus 01:41:06 And 28 to hit. And this is really laggy. 10 damage. Yeah, I'm another 12 damage on that strike. And then with a bonus action, I will pull up a magic stone. And then on
Kaladen Shash 01:41:18 Yeah, my dice rolls are going slow.
Dungeon Master 01:41:28 Very hurt. So how close to you want to get or do you want to stay there? Okay, 22 hits.
Leopold Magnus 01:41:35 Bone Crusher's turn. He will attack the same guy I was attacking, but with a firebolt. He'll stay back for now. Excellent. 16 damage. Woo. Zinging him.
Dungeon Master 01:41:58 Uh, finishing. The steam of smoke at the basis.
Leopold Magnus 01:42:00 Yeah, so Bone Crusher's arm starts to whirl up. You see kind of air pull in, a large flame starts to center around his wrist, and it just goes echoing out and just cleanly blows this guy's head off. Just obliterates him in a pink mist and his corpse. Yeah. Falls to the ground.
Dungeon Master 01:42:27 After that, it is. This guy, he's going to get into flanking around Cyrus, an attack with advantage. That is, I rolled a Nat 1 or Nat 2. That is, I rolled a Nat 1 or Nat 2. That's 6 to hit.
Kaladen Shash 01:42:53 It's incredible. No worries.
Cyrus Schwert 01:42:55 Those aren't going to do it. It's not going to do it. All good. There's a lot of them. All good. There's a lot of them.
Dungeon Master 01:42:57 What a... Jesse, your rack is different. So far, you cast Sacred Flame. You're good. It's round three.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:02 Yes. All right. I just wanted to say, sorry for taking so long. The power's been out for like three days and everything had to switch over at once. And so I'm back. So everything should be good. All right. Can I get just a tiny bit of what's going on? Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 01:43:02 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:43:26 When they didn't finish all the enemies at round two, more came in. And beyond that, it's just kind of an annoying slug fest because the Nat 1 role for the survival check, let it immediately through the encounter. You didn't even make it out of town yet.
Leopold Magnus 01:43:44 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:44 Oh, shit. Okay. So there's the one dead, undead-looking thing, and then the two other ones are they, one bigger than the rest? All right.
Dungeon Master 01:43:50 It's all nulls. So there's like some stronger looking knolls, some more like huntery-looking ones. And then there's like a couple null pack lords so far, which is a pretty random array of them. So far they don't all seem super strong. They all seem to be able to get killed with like in three hits.
Cyrus Schwert 01:44:07 two right in the mixer and there's one on the roof so it down
Zariel Torgan 01:44:18 I'm going to cast a third level conjure animals, and it's going to be eight wolves. Aren't you glad I came back?
Dungeon Master 01:44:28 Oh, man. Okay. Okay. You obviously can do all their stuff at once. Go ahead and roll their... Do they go right after you? Or they roll...
Leopold Magnus 01:44:30 Coming in hot.
Kaladen Shash 01:44:31 This is the DM's favorite DM's favorite. Did all the tokens.
Cyrus Schwert 01:44:38 It's a great time to have two conjuring druids on the party for Jonathan. So many creatures to keep trying. It's got to be a mob. He put in ape. He had eight.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:57 I think they're supposed to technically roll their own initiative. Okay. So I'll roll just a 20. 14. Oh, I thought you needed me to roll for their, when there go.
Dungeon Master 01:45:00 Okay, they're gonna roll on a group initiative, but they go almost right after you. Oh, what are you rolling for? Oh, no, I rolled their initiative.
Cyrus Schwert 01:45:11 It's pretty. It's almost there in the initiative order.
Kaladen Shash 01:45:26 initiative.
Dungeon Master 01:45:29 just automatically. Unfortunately, they got a four, but
Zariel Torgan 01:45:29 Oh, gotcha. Gotcha. Okay, well, that's it. That's my action. Yeah, bonus action. Is anybody looking hurt? Doesn't look like it. All right, then yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:45:45 Two right up by Cyrus at the entrance are here. The three that are closest to them are hurt. There's the one little pescu at the house on the left that is full health. We could, well. Yeah. That's so many wolves I can't believe you.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:45 I'm not sure anyone sticking hit.
Kaladen Shash 01:46:02 He might be a little bit more dangerous than the others. He was able to sort of enrage others. What could you do, John? Okay, cool, go, go, go.
Dungeon Master 01:46:10 Nothing. The Nulls only get their rage ability if they get a kill, but they can't kill you. So that's like an innate ability that he also can't activate. Okay. After that, it is...
Cyrus Schwert 01:46:15 the young one
Leopold Magnus 01:46:25 You can't touch this.
Zariel Torgan 01:46:29 All right, that's my turn. I'm pretty sure that does hit. Sorry, I don't have them pulled up yet. Oh, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:46:36 Where is he on the map? That guy right there. He now has multiple targets surrounding him, so he's just going to take his spear attack right in front. First one is a 15 to hit the wall. And second one is a 21 to hit the wall. I think their AC is 12.
Zariel Torgan 01:46:59 I think so. I think you're right. All right. All right. It's dead.
Cyrus Schwert 01:47:06 There's so many things.
Dungeon Master 01:47:07 That's 8 damage plus 10 damage, 18 damage from that to that one wolf right in front of them. Okay, that one is God. You have seven wolves. After that, it is your group of wolf turns. Mm-hmm.
Zariel Torgan 01:47:28 All right, so they roll on advantage if they have any creature within five feet. I think they all do. So there's seven left that. They each get two attacks. That's going to be... Maybe not. Hang on. Oh, no. I don't think they do. That was a mistake. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:47:40 No way. To attack for each of them. It's crazy.
Leopold Magnus 01:47:44 With us.
Kaladen Shash 01:47:51 That would have been so overpowered, 14 attacks off of that.
Zariel Torgan 01:47:55 No, that was a mistake. Sorry, I'm thinking of my will form. Yeah. Advantage. Yeah. So I'm just going to roll 14 just to make it fast because they all have an advantage. And so we're looking at natural 20, 15, 17, 18.
Dungeon Master 01:47:59 Yeah, they get one melee attack. It's a plus four to hit. It's a D6 plus two piercing damage. But they have the like the knockdown ability.
Cyrus Schwert 01:48:18 Thank you very much.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:26 Another 15, a 13, a 12, and an 11, all plus 4. So the lowest was an 11. Sorry, it was 11 plus 4. So it would be 15 to be the lowest. Okay, so that's 76 plus 14. Yeah. So this plus 14.
Dungeon Master 01:48:34 Oh, the 11 would miss. Would that have been again? Okay, 15's the lowest. All of them hit. Okay, hold on.
Cyrus Schwert 01:48:58 There's an awful world. It doesn't know.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:59 That was a really good role. Plus 14. 47.
Dungeon Master 01:49:04 33 damage. That's 11. Okay, plus 14, so that's 47 points. So that's, okay, I'm going to add up their total HP. 11, 22, 23, 24. And the guy on the roof is still untuck. So all of the ones in the group are massacred.
Leopold Magnus 01:49:13 It's ripped apart.
Kaladen Shash 01:49:24 That's
Cyrus Schwert 01:49:33 Shit. Oh? It was actually not... I was the brave one to cast a third level spell. And it worked.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:35 Good boys. I shouldn't even see him.
Dungeon Master 01:49:35 So the only one that's left is this guy right there.
Dungeon Master 01:49:52 Okay. After that, Cletus, you watch all of these sort of metallic sort of spectral nature-based wolves like jump out of a split in space and time and they just start ripping the knolls to pieces. What do you want to do on your turn?
Cyrus Schwert 01:50:14 Oh, hard to follow up seven fucking wolves. Let's see. I'm just going to start running. Let's see. I'm going to use my full dash. Would that be able to get me up onto the roof with him? He's 40 feet. Is a half movement to climb?
Dungeon Master 01:50:34 just for that one section so 40 feet technically gets you there so you would have you would get to the base of the house with your movement or like technically halfway off the wall
Kaladen Shash 01:50:38 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:50:50 Yeah. I'm a sprint. You have 20 speed? Huh? What's your speed? I have 30 speed. Oh, so I have 60. I just, with the climb, I couldn't do anything. Well, conveniently, nothing will do it. Okay, so I'm on the roof. Can you bonus action anything?
Dungeon Master 01:51:07 Oh, no, if you have 60, it was 40 essentially to get you there and more feet you can get to the route. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:51:21 Well, no, I... Okay. Yeah, now I'm conveniently right on them. I don't think I can really do any bonus. A bonus action? That's not worth it. Um, all right. Sprint up to him. I'm gassed. I usually do not sprint. And, uh, yep, that's me. Or wait a pinfall.
Dungeon Master 01:51:42 you're doing the mix of like you breathe through your your mouth and then you try to control it so you're like heavily breathing through your nose but it's just just as labored and you're like you sort of catch your breath again you have to breathe out of your mouth or you're going to like suffocate um back up to the top paladin
Kaladen Shash 01:51:56 Did he say that he's all the way up to him, or is that as far as you get still five feet away? Okay, okay. So advantage if I get right next to him.
Cyrus Schwert 01:51:56 Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:52:11 He's on the roof, but he's not in melee. No, unless you, like, shoved him with your first attack and moved him closer, but nothing for free. 19 hits.
Kaladen Shash 01:52:27 Very great. That's OK. I'm going to use all three of the subject blasts from where I'm at to shoot at him. First one is a 19. 21. 21. 24.
Dungeon Master 01:52:42 21 hits and 24 hits. Oh, shit, sorry. Also, while he's doing that, somebody, roll me a deeper. 18 points of damage.
Leopold Magnus 01:52:58 Oh, God. I can roll it this time. Two.
Kaladen Shash 01:53:01 18 forced damage. Oh, because one standing. We can get ready. The wolf's got this. Easy work. Wolf's got it.
Cyrus Schwert 01:53:02 But in.
Dungeon Master 01:53:13 Who? You see coming around the base of each of these trees, one of them over the fence, over that two more null hunters pop around the corner. Okay, but after Caledon, it's the guy on the roof. He's going to move into melee with Eucleus, take some attacks.
Cyrus Schwert 01:53:43 no let me catch my breath first damn it it's
Dungeon Master 01:53:50 First one's a natural one. Second one is a natural 20. The first one, he, like, swings so hard, he falls to the ground, but he spins all the way around, and his second attack, like, hits you in the Achilles heel with his nasty-ass slave, and he hits you for double damage. He kind of, like, breakdances on accident.
Kaladen Shash 01:53:57 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:54:14 All right, that was badass. I'll admit it. Now that's called going to blow. Jesus. That's just rude. All right.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:17 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:54:24 You take 16 points of damage in total. But then it is Cyrus's turn.
Cyrus Schwert 01:54:46 any of them. 30 feet of that one? Yeah, for sure. Yeah, you're 15. Yeah. Put me to that. Three. I'm going to push this motherfucker and swing my sword of them. I'm going to roll it in real life because it's going to be faster. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:55:03 Okay. 16 hits. 13 damage. 13 damage.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:07 Thanks.
Cyrus Schwert 01:55:13 So it's 2d6 plus 8. Half of its force and it's 5 plus 8 is 13 image on the first one. I swing it him again a 15 to hit.
Dungeon Master 01:55:32 Looking very hurt. 15 exactly hits. He is knock, knock, knocking on death's door.
Cyrus Schwert 01:55:45 Two plus six damage. Eight more. Two months. Yeah. Son of a bitch. I can't waste another bonus action on this fucking fight. Or can't waste another bonus action on this fucking fight. Or can I.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:59 Oh.
Kaladen Shash 01:55:59 Love that.
Leopold Magnus 01:55:59 No, no, no, no.
Dungeon Master 01:56:01 One HP. Yeah. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:56:16 Yeah. Can I do a slashing floor? Is that on my phone? Okay. Slashing floorish is another DA. On that, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:56:36 I mean, he's got one HP, so minimum damage kills him. But if you give you some bonus with it. You just walk up and split his throat. And that's your turn. After that is the one on the other side near the tree. You see he like...
Cyrus Schwert 01:56:45 so i kill him which is great and that's i've used all my things on this stupid thank you
Dungeon Master 01:57:05 howls out and points at you sort of menacingly like you killed his friend. And he's just going to take too long bow shop that I get you. First one, Nat 2 misses. Second one is a natural 18, dirty 22.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:05 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:57:17 Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:57:35 I did not hear that, but I feel like that hits. Jesus. Soft roll. You take three points of damage. Leopold. There's one right there, too.
Cyrus Schwert 01:57:48 Let's go
Leopold Magnus 01:57:51 Oh, let's go. God, there's so many. Is this the only one left on the field? Or am I missing one? Oh, there's one up here, huh? Yeah. Okay. Is one look more hurt than another? Okay. I will... Let's see.
Kaladen Shash 01:58:05 Yeah, previous engaged.
Dungeon Master 01:58:12 Um, actually they're somewhat comparable. Yeah. 15 hits.
Leopold Magnus 01:58:23 Yeah, I got enough room to close the distance here. Move up here and I will take two attacks with my searing saber. 15 to hit. Nice. 14 plus 6.20 damage. Damn.
Kaladen Shash 01:58:47 Very good. Okay. It's okay. It's okay. Very good.
Zariel Torgan 01:58:47 Nice. Oh no.
Dungeon Master 01:58:52 incredibly, incredibly hurt. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:58:56 Ugh. And then I will hold my second attack on it, and I will just hurdle a magic stone at this one. 23 to hit.
Dungeon Master 01:59:23 23 hits. 7. 22 hits. 22 hits.
Leopold Magnus 01:59:27 Seven damage on the stone. And then I'll say to bone crusher finish this one up here. And I'll have him launch a fireball, firebolt. Ah, 22 to hit.
Cyrus Schwert 01:59:42 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:59:54 Damn, fucking low roll, four damage. This one, bone crusher isn't quite as dialed in. Going for center of mass, the fireball just clips one of his legs, sends him flying like a top. Ending back here in a puff of dust.
Kaladen Shash 01:59:56 Oh. Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:59:59 He had 2 HP, so finish him. Spinning out, spinning out, leading everywhere.
Dungeon Master 02:00:26 Okay. That is Zaryl's turn then. One left. Mm-hmm.
Zariel Torgan 02:00:36 um just the one on the roof then huh i have that's distance uh yeah yeah i'll just shoot a sacred flame yeah 16 all right so he takes
Dungeon Master 02:00:54 It's a deck save then, right? Eight fails. Damn, okay. Looking really hurt. Don't worry, there's seven, there are seven wolves that still need to go.
Zariel Torgan 02:01:06 2D8 radiant damage for a total of 15. Jesus. Oh! So I've got 40 feet of movement, and it's 25 feet to get into, no, 22 feet to get into combat. So,
Kaladen Shash 02:01:10 Yes. Yes. Oh, we're going to get another round to these fuckers. Clevis, you must finish him. Can he climb under the roof? Can they climb that roof?
Leopold Magnus 02:01:12 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:01:20 A wolf can for sure climb that roof.
Zariel Torgan 02:01:35 Can I jump that with like 10 feet of movement? Or how would you prefer? Yeah, so I'm moving this. Go ahead. Oh, I'm sorry. I already, I thought we were on to the wolves. I can't do anything other than the sacred flame. I don't have any good bonus actions.
Dungeon Master 02:01:41 um sorry from where you're at uh it's it's straight line to get there right so 40 feet gets you to the house just to the base of it oh
Cyrus Schwert 02:01:53 What's up?
Dungeon Master 02:02:02 um it the way it works is it's movement to the house and then half movement to get up and it's like 10 feet tall so it takes you know it'll probably take their full thing to get on but i'll say you can like world war z this where if like three wolves clump up at the bottom the other two can like sort of pyramid up
Kaladen Shash 02:02:24 Pyramid Pyramid. Pyramid. Whoa.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:27 All right, the farthest ones are going to create the pyramid and the two closest ones will be the ones that ran up and they'll be the ones that were able to actually get there. Like that. All right, so it gives me two attacks with advantage. So that's 4D4, sorry, 4D20. It's r. All right, 16 and 18.
Dungeon Master 02:02:36 Okay. Guys, looking really hurt. You could probably finish it if you land. These wolves are like a mass over the building. Yep.
Cyrus Schwert 02:02:47 Turn around. Oh, fuck. The wolves. The wolves are coming. The wolves are coming.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:57 So it both hit. So that's 2D6 plus 4. So 7. Oh, no. I don't know that they could, well, let me check. I don't know if they could make it. No. 40 feet gets into here.
Dungeon Master 02:03:06 Oh my gosh, still alive. I think you've got two more wolves. 40, 40? No, I mean.
Kaladen Shash 02:03:08 Oh! The user can't get there 40 feet or something like that. One.
Cyrus Schwert 02:03:21 I'll fight at 10 p.m.
Dungeon Master 02:03:28 I had it measured as a drag. 40 gets this one to the base, but the other one, too, in combat if you wanted. So you get one more attack. 14 misses.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:36 All right. Let's do it. 2D20. 14. Oh, he doesn't get there.
Kaladen Shash 02:03:49 Okay, we'll eat this. Finish him.
Cyrus Schwert 02:03:50 It is. They got to hit him. Well, I got a swing my mighty staff first. 27. That'll fucking. Who cares.
Dungeon Master 02:03:52 Let's go, Cletus. There is this massive wolves biting, snipping at this null as it tries to take you out. How do you want to finish this? Because he's got 2 HP. You got advantage, 27. 18.
Zariel Torgan 02:04:12 Nice. God damn.
Cyrus Schwert 02:04:19 Oh, max damage, 14. I just walked it straight on his skull and make a dent. And all in all, and pierces his skull. Yeah. Chip sharpened it with his teeth.
Dungeon Master 02:04:24 Finish him. It's just dead to the school. You see his tongue sticks out in his eyes instantly go sideways. Just stops moving and drums. Like an obsidian blade, it's sort of jagged on the side.
Kaladen Shash 02:04:24 Oh.
Leopold Magnus 02:04:27 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:04:50 and you guys pause for a moment waiting and you one second two seconds five seconds 30 seconds no more howling nor more snarling desert out of combat you see his shutters close on the distance
Cyrus Schwert 02:04:50 Can we even spoken? You got another staff. We saved your village again.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:03 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 02:05:04 Oh, thank goodness. Probably make a killing. Probably make it killing.
Kaladen Shash 02:05:05 What was that?
Cyrus Schwert 02:05:20 I want to turn into the Affleck duck and promote insurance amongst this village. Maybe gap. Um, well, so that was, that sucked. I didn't even make it like, I think we walked like 60 feet.
Dungeon Master 02:05:27 Yeah, you were on your way of Cottonwood. Yeah, you were on your way out of town. That's just the border of Cottonwood.
Kaladen Shash 02:05:36 Thanks.
Leopold Magnus 02:05:45 Well, I suppose we better get out of here. This place is cursed.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:45 I like to imagine we're still in the parking lot. Round two, let's try this again.
Cyrus Schwert 02:05:52 Not even to the ticket booth yet. I'm ready for a fucking nap again. I'm gonna cast a healing word on myself. Let's go back to Cornelius's place. Let's take a rest. Healing.
Dungeon Master 02:06:16 11 human nights. Your bonds with Leopold, isn't it?
Cyrus Schwert 02:06:19 Does anybody else hurt? No, you know what, Zario, let's do this. Let's test our bond. My bad. Oh, Leopold is not hurt. Never mind. You still heal you. One HP. You know what? Oh, you know what? I'll just do a cure wounds on myself.
Zariel Torgan 02:06:26 All right.
Kaladen Shash 02:06:30 Yes. Well it's test this.
Dungeon Master 02:06:48 Some missiles, seven points of healing. Leopold's you heal one HP. The one little scuff sort of buffs out instantaneously.
Cyrus Schwert 02:06:48 have an HP. Hell yeah. With the power of friendship and roasted almond. Right.
Leopold Magnus 02:06:54 Oh yeah. I'm going to take it.
Cyrus Schwert 02:07:15 Well, let's get out of this godforsaken place. I am now against this village. I can do it. I got a good one. 21. 21.
Dungeon Master 02:07:19 Okay, somebody else, give me a survival check? No, nobody... I'm gonna say you gotta rotate through. Twenty-one.
Zariel Torgan 02:07:21 You don't want me? That's fair. It better be a one. That's pretty good.
Dungeon Master 02:07:42 You've got good weather and easy moving as you sort of make your way through the grasslands into the trees a little bit thicker. It's like the transition is very gradual. So the trees are huge at first and they're like pretty scattered, but you had like waist high.
Kaladen Shash 02:07:42 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:08:02 sort of like wheat grass that sort of is in the whole area. And then the deeper you get and the less sunlight you find, the grass gets shorter with time until sometimes it's just walking on bare dirt in rooted areas. You sort of follow game paths. The trees get smaller in overall circumference, but they get a little bit more dense as you get in.
Dungeon Master 02:08:24 as you guys make your way through the Chiari Rung Forest. 21 was good enough you didn't have to make an encounter check. There will be one more survival check for the day who wants to take the third one.
Cyrus Schwert 02:08:46 Is Callaghan relatively okay? I have a one. I'm not very wise. I haven't learned a lot in this life yet. I don't know what those are.
Kaladen Shash 02:08:48 I have a plus two on that. I don't have a ton of wisdom. It's not bad. I can do it. I don't know somebody's... Let me... Let me check. I'm assuming this is outside of the... How long is Barta good for? Is it just a... Is it just battle or is it ten minutes?
Leopold Magnus 02:08:54 My wisdom is terrible, so.
Dungeon Master 02:09:15 I think you just have a, you have parted. You have it until you used it for a day. Hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 02:09:18 can't have it until he
Kaladen Shash 02:09:18 Okay. Okay, sweet. Then let me roll with plus, this will be plus 10 or plus 8th of the number. We need all of it. Geez. A 12. Oh, no, it's a D8. I'm saying I'm rolling the best number. Let me tell you what the actual number is going to be.
Dungeon Master 02:09:51 Give me an eight. Three, seven total. Yeah, first I was going to say no, but that's, I like that. You, um, what do you say to the plants?
Cyrus Schwert 02:09:53 Come on. Can I even be managed by like casting speak with plants and turning thick terrain into navigable, navigable terrain? Hey, we're having a tough. Hey.
Kaladen Shash 02:09:54 Is it three? We're gonna seven. The weather, the weather is no good. It's very bad.
Leopold Magnus 02:09:55 Oh, yeah, hell yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:10:01 Oh, Indy.
Cyrus Schwert 02:10:23 right now we like have not gone anywhere like we're just trying to get through the forest and it'd be really chill if you guys like moved out of the way a little bit and let us through thanks brother man
Dungeon Master 02:10:33 You see it's like a bunch of dense bushes and one of them sort of like it hasn't have a face. It's very amorphous, but it really looks like it turns to you. And he goes, oh yeah, no problem, dude. And it like, they back off and open up. Callen, you can roll it again.
Kaladen Shash 02:10:55 Okay. Is it just going to... That is fantastic. Unreal. I love this. Show us how low we can get.
Cyrus Schwert 02:10:55 Come on, Callan. Okay. Oh, more. Oh, more.
Dungeon Master 02:10:58 The Bartik is still used, so you still have a plus three in addition to anything else you roll. Okay, so the high roll was seven. Somebody roll me in encounter check. This is going to be just a D20 from a table.
Leopold Magnus 02:11:07 Oh, my God.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:07 Oh, no.
Cyrus Schwert 02:11:25 Lance did it. Cyrus got. Sorry. I'll try. You know, I'm really back. You know, I'm really back going home idea.
Kaladen Shash 02:11:25 Show a seller we can get. Yes. Strong, very strong. They told us. Cornelius said this was trouble. We are walking into trouble. Why are you surprised?
Zariel Torgan 02:11:37 We're never getting out of here.
Leopold Magnus 02:11:38 Jesus Christ, we're still just in the village.
Dungeon Master 02:11:42 Oh, wow. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:11:54 It told us it was dangerous. I just didn't know it happened like so fast, so frequent. It gets from coming at us. It's fast and furious Tokyo drug. I tried my best.
Kaladen Shash 02:11:58 Those are strong worlds. Got them out of the way. It's got them out of the way.
Dungeon Master 02:12:09 I didn't even have another encounter plan initially, but I didn't think you guys would have so bad.
Leopold Magnus 02:12:15 You just haven't gotten to it yet.
Cyrus Schwert 02:12:27 It's cursed. I only rolled good when I did it in real life. I'm just going to do that. Maybe that's the key. I have a reliable source.
Kaladen Shash 02:12:38 Jonathan, did you say was the Chiari Forest? Is that what you called it or what did you say? You say blood rain? Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:12:44 Kiyari Rung, I'll put you on the, it's the Jays and I, but it, you'll see why in a little bit when it gets to it, but it's like just different languages put together, roughly translating to blood rainforest. Yes.
Cyrus Schwert 02:12:57 A red dragon. A red dragon. A red adult.
Dungeon Master 02:13:16 You know what? Fuck it. I know what I'm going to throw at you guys.
Leopold Magnus 02:13:21 Yeah, a golden dragon swoops in. What? Hmm?
Cyrus Schwert 02:13:27 beholder an actual... Rex! What the fuck? Are we in the dark? I thought that...
Kaladen Shash 02:13:36 I love this. How do we retreat? Look at size of this thing.
Dungeon Master 02:13:45 Yeah. This is also for Jesse. You guys are walking through the force. It's getting denser. You have a hard time you're seeing. But as you're walking through, you hear just the water puddles at your feet sort of shake
Leopold Magnus 02:13:54 You didn't load. I got to refresh. Oh, nice.
Cyrus Schwert 02:14:00 What?
Dungeon Master 02:14:14 as it ripples and beat with the footsteps. You guys hear a loud, cacophonist roar as a T-Rex turns around a tree sort of bend where it gets not so dense, makes eye contact with you. Everybody go ahead and roll initiative again.
Kaladen Shash 02:14:32 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:14:33 I don't know what you've been in this. And that's all the guys meet the wrong. It's got a big head. 16. And now we actually. What's on the business on the day? See them as well burn your spouse. It's been.
Leopold Magnus 02:14:34 Oh, geez. Oh, dear.
Dungeon Master 02:14:59 Okay, Caledon, you're up first. I love it. You can't see it rolling so bad. You've never seen this creature looking at it visually. It's not as large as the young red dragon you've bought. These are...
Cyrus Schwert 02:15:03 skin moving. Thank you. Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:15:03 Would I... I know. Would I understand that can we win this fight? Is this... I mean, I've never seen this creature in my life. Would I... Okay, the token would suggest... Okay. Okay. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:15:28 Large creatures. You've never seen this. This is definitely reptilian. You can tell from its skin and its teeth that it's like lizard adjacent serpent-like. You've never seen these kind of creatures. But it doesn't look like the most dangerous thing you've ever faced.
Kaladen Shash 02:15:47 Okay. And then Italian. Our tokens are there they're just popping on the map.
Cyrus Schwert 02:15:47 I think we're pretty sure this is Julius's cousin. It's reptilian. It has skills.
Dungeon Master 02:16:07 Let me put you sort of here. So just he just disappeared at one point. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:16:18 Oh shit. Yeah. It was while you're describing the dinosaur. He has a distinct fear of P-Rexes, dude. Why'd you do that? Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:16:20 Maybe the power went out again.
Kaladen Shash 02:16:32 And then what's circling around the T-Rex? Are those like smaller lizard creatures with them? Of course. Okay. Well, um, I'm going to cast mirror image.
Dungeon Master 02:16:38 Those ever lost rafters.
Cyrus Schwert 02:16:53 I wouldn't have a gaming task to help you have a lot with the loss record. I wouldn't ask if you can just stand with this value. I know.
Kaladen Shash 02:17:09 I will move 30 feet this direction. How do we fight this thing? Yes, I used my action. I used my action already. I thought to do so.
Cyrus Schwert 02:17:22 Attack. I just go hit him with something probably like a big, like your sword or whatever. I don't know. I see. I don't know.
Kaladen Shash 02:17:45 That's at my turn, T-R-X, T-R-X-Go. It says T-R-X at 19, and then Cretus. I've got Cyrus at 18.
Dungeon Master 02:17:49 Okay. Well, actually, after that is Cyrus. Why is... It says you're above. Hold on. That's weird. I'm going to take you out of combat and put it back in.
Cyrus Schwert 02:17:53 What? I rolled an eight total. It should be me. It should be the T-Rex next. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:18:16 Is everybody else where they should be? I've got Caledon at 22. T.Rex at 19. Leopold, you're at 15, right? So that was just weird that that one was off. Okay. There it is. Okay. So then it's the T-Rex. It is gonna... Make a...
Leopold Magnus 02:18:25 Yep.
Cyrus Schwert 02:18:27 And Cretus has.
Dungeon Master 02:18:46 Tail it's going to run up straight ahead because it's not smart and take a tail attack against Pleetus here. Cletus dirty, 20 to hit. This thing kind of hits hard. 24 points of damage.
Cyrus Schwert 02:18:56 Oh, fuck. Yeah. I've got that 4010. Yep. It's a board being. Why am I in the wrong? 24. All right. Oh. Whoa.
Kaladen Shash 02:19:10 48. You are prone. Clayton going down quick you guys.
Dungeon Master 02:19:20 and you are knocked prone. It'll then take a bite attack at a advantage against you because you are prone. That is a 23 to hit.
Leopold Magnus 02:19:22 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:19:40 Yo. I think I'm dead. Ford? Caled, I'm never trusting you for survival ever again. My God. I'm still up, barely. Oh my God.
Kaladen Shash 02:19:44 I mean, this could be, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Whoa, he's still up. It's okay. It's his turn next. He'll be okay.
Dungeon Master 02:19:52 That is 31 points of damage. But you are grappled in its mouth. But you are grappled in its mouth. And while grappled, you...
Leopold Magnus 02:19:54 Jesus, Christ.
Dungeon Master 02:20:09 You cannot be targeted by the tail attack. So it bites down and scoops you off the ground and you're sort of in the air hanging from its mouth as it's trying to bite down. You like fit in between individual teeth. So like it's not getting you every single time of a junior in a bad place. After that, though, it is your turn.
Cyrus Schwert 02:20:13 Oh, good. Awesome. Awesome. Do I have to do a strength check to get ungrappled? Can I do anything while grappled?
Dungeon Master 02:20:40 You can do anything normal when grappled except not moving. So you can attack it normal, attacking other creatures at disadvantaged. You can use your action, try to break the grapple if you'd like.
Cyrus Schwert 02:20:46 All right. Absolutely fuck this thing, since we don't know what it is. I want to fucking, I'm going to cast fourth level moon beam on this bitch, but in a straight line to hit the Velociraptors.
Kaladen Shash 02:21:13 Hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 02:21:17 as well. Is it possible? Because I usually do a top down, but this time I'm doing a line just threw it into the other Velocerafter. Yeah, I want to save. I can't like to get on.
Dungeon Master 02:21:27 Yeah. I like that. Let's take con-save. Okay, T-Rax. Con-save is a 16. Veloceraptor gets a 7.
Cyrus Schwert 02:21:49 He makes it for him. Are they all within five feet of each other? No. No. I was just doing the line. Let's do the one on the left. Just align. Just align.
Dungeon Master 02:22:00 15. Oh, no, they're pretty far apart. Okay, well, they both, I believe they both fail anyway.
Kaladen Shash 02:22:09 They're just the one, just the T-Rex and the one.
Cyrus Schwert 02:22:20 Okay, so T-Rex takes half, Velocer takes full. 18 damage? Oh, one. Which one is that?
Dungeon Master 02:22:31 18 damage. And we'll just call that one B. How much damage total was it?
Cyrus Schwert 02:22:51 18, so 9 to the T-Rex, 18 to the Velociraptor. Nice. That works. Bonus action. Let's see. As a bonus action...
Dungeon Master 02:22:58 You kill one of the Vlosh, the Vlostructure. You fry it. Okay. Anything else?
Cyrus Schwert 02:23:24 I feel like it won't do anything. I think... I'll just bonus action shalele my staff. This goes. I'm just dangling from this fucking mouth. Crazy.
Kaladen Shash 02:23:34 Wow.
Dungeon Master 02:23:35 Bonus actions to Laley. Okay. After that, it is Zario your turn. Tell that you disappeared. I did figure that that's what happened, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:23:47 Hello. I don't know if you guys missed me or not, but the power went out again for like 30 seconds. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if anybody thanked you or not for bringing up the T-Rex, but I'm going to go ahead and do it now. Thank you. I would like to...
Cyrus Schwert 02:23:56 All right. All right.
Kaladen Shash 02:24:05 You look.
Dungeon Master 02:24:05 You're welcome. There's two block tractors too there too, so those will now be accessible for your summon stuff. That goes for both of you.
Zariel Torgan 02:24:15 I would like to take one look at this T-Rex, and I would like you guys to watch me as I morph and change into the exact same T-Rex. But with like pink stripes, pink and green stripes. And then very...
Cyrus Schwert 02:24:38 for giving fuel space. Let's see.
Zariel Torgan 02:24:44 Jurassic Park-esque. I'm just going to let out a big roar. And let's see what I want to do here. I like to do two things. I like to make my attacks. Well, here, actually, first I'll roll around here so that I go a little long way. Just so that I can get advantage. And then... Did I?
Dungeon Master 02:25:11 You had advantage where you were? What are you doing? Oh, well, Cyrus technically hasn't gone into melee with it yet. And Cletus is guffled by it, so yeah, he couldn't, he's not conservative.
Cyrus Schwert 02:25:23 group.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:23 Oh, okay. Oh, so I wouldn't get advantage regardless. Gotcha. Okay, well, I'll go around here anyway just in preparation, but I want to try something. But first, I'll attack. So that's going to be plus 10 to hit on both, first the bite, then the tail. So each of these plus 10. So first, 26.
Dungeon Master 02:25:53 26 hits. Hits.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:54 Okay, and then natural 20 on the tail. And so 4D12 plus 7 for the bite, so I'll do that real quick. So this plus 7. 24 on the bite. And then let's see, 3D8 plus 7.
Cyrus Schwert 02:26:00 It feels like.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:25 for the crit. So this plus seven. So 16 doubled. So 32 on the tail attack. And I'd like to turn to this velociraptor and try to get him to think of me as the alpha and attack the other one.
Cyrus Schwert 02:26:31 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 02:26:34 32. 32. Um, no.
Zariel Torgan 02:27:04 No. Okay, that's fair. Oh. That's fair. That's fair. That's it. That's my turn.
Dungeon Master 02:27:05 The other Velocrupter is already dead for one. And also, I would never make you roll for something that I wouldn't let happen. You're not going to swing it to attack the one. It doesn't know you. Okay. Turn into a T.R.X. I didn't know you could do that. Leopold. It is your turn.
Leopold Magnus 02:27:33 Oh dear, some vicious raptors here. I will cast blur on myself, which will give anyone attempting to hit me disadvantage on attack roles. Immune if they perceive you with blind sight or true sight.
Dungeon Master 02:27:43 Okay. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:27:59 And then with a bonus action, I will hurdle a stone. Get a little damage going. 12 to hit. Damn. Stone goes wide. And then bone crusher.
Dungeon Master 02:28:15 A 12 misses. Okay, I'm getting that token again, I've got to go find it, copy every time. Misses.
Leopold Magnus 02:28:25 will launch a volley of fire bolts just from the ranged location. Oh, sorry, natural one, so misses. That is my, well, let's see if I want to move. Yeah, I will.
Leopold Magnus 02:28:54 Which one of these is Jesse and which one is the? Okay, so this one is the fighting, the one we're fighting? Okay. Yep, I'll just close the distance and get in there in a flanking position with Cletus.
Dungeon Master 02:28:58 Just he's on the left. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:59 All right, I'm sorry.
Kaladen Shash 02:29:08 Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:29:19 Don't go right there. I have moonbeam right there. It's just in line with the... It's just dead with the... in line with the dead velociraptor. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:29:24 Oh, shit. Hard to see where the moon beam is, but didn't you cast it straight through? All right. So if I maybe just, I won't have flanking, but I'll just take that position there. All right.
Dungeon Master 02:29:30 Because it's not down. Oh, what the hell? Why? Why is the whole map moon beam? Jesus.
Kaladen Shash 02:29:41 Oh, it's awesome. The whole map's moonbeam. Someone dropped a huge AOE. There it goes.
Cyrus Schwert 02:29:49 I nuked everyone. It's a five-foot. It's a five-foot diameter. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:29:54 That is my turn.
Dungeon Master 02:30:03 Is Moonbeam 10 foot radius or diameter? Five foot and we're doing a line. Okay. Oh, I guess we should pick a range for it. We'll say it's 30 feet tall. Because that would have worked.
Kaladen Shash 02:30:21 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 02:30:37 I think it's technically like 60 feet, but it really doesn't need to be that right now. 40 foot. Like the...
Dungeon Master 02:30:42 No, it just needs to be that for that. Okay. After that is the Velociraptor's turn. It jumps onto Jesse's back like the movie. It makes two attacks, one with claws and one with bite.
Zariel Torgan 02:31:11 Probably got advantage because I'm hairy, another one. Oh, yeah. Does that's it. Yeah. That's it, beats it, beats it.
Dungeon Master 02:31:13 It does. First one is a 21 to hit. And second one is a 21 and 13, right?
Cyrus Schwert 02:31:39 It's pizza.
Dungeon Master 02:31:44 You take six and six. You take 12 points of damage total. Up next is, he should go at your turn actually. 14. Steel defenders, not up next is Cyrus. Up next is Cyrus.
Zariel Torgan 02:31:50 Nice. Alright, sounds good.
Cyrus Schwert 02:32:11 I'm next to Cyrus. I go up to this motherfucking T-Rex. Is he, get him out of your mouth? Swing. My sword at him. Oh! Of, 16. Oh, really? Wait, it's worth your mouth. So...
Kaladen Shash 02:32:14 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:22 Nice. Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:32:32 16 hits. We weren't through Jesse that 13 is AC. 16.
Cyrus Schwert 02:32:40 Got it, thank you. So total, because it doesn't roll the 2D6s, it's 16 damage on the first one? And then the next one is 11 to hit, and I rolled it 21 to hit on the second attack. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:32:52 about it.
Dungeon Master 02:33:03 Oh, so second one hits and then 11 damage. Uh, looking pretty hurt, but not dead. It is at... Bagby. Okay. That one...
Cyrus Schwert 02:33:13 Okay. And that will do it for me. So just dangling. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:33:33 And Calden, you're at the top. 26 hits.
Kaladen Shash 02:33:38 I'm going to go ahead and cast one esoptic blast at it, and then close the distance by running. Get my backup to the can troops. Uh, 26 to hit. Excellent.
Cyrus Schwert 02:33:44 I just turn it on. I just... Super quiet.
Kaladen Shash 02:34:08 right up to the moon beam, but not in it so I can attack. 14 hits, right? And then 22 hits, sweet. So both of these will go. That's going to be 2G10.
Dungeon Master 02:34:15 Go for it. 14 hits. And 22 hits.
Cyrus Schwert 02:34:15 It shakes through all this for that. Yes. I'll take the end and it start of his turn. It takes them. I will. If you have something that's like grapple do that's why it's so good against the brain.
Kaladen Shash 02:34:41 2D6. 31. 31 points. 31 points.
Cyrus Schwert 02:34:44 The chain of boys from that. That wasn't been. There was a great challenge in like two pillars, people are still in all. I just kept it all in the pillar and that power. It's permanent. Damn.
Dungeon Master 02:34:56 Oh. Incredibly hurt, but still standing. You take a chunk out of it. Slice one of its legs, it hobbles down for a second, almost falling before it rises back up. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:35:15 But having me for dinner. I know.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:19 All right. All right. Sounds good.
Cyrus Schwert 02:35:19 Oh, accent change. Constitution. Yeah, he's starting. Yeah, he's starting his turn in the moon. Yeah, he's starting his turn in the moon being.
Dungeon Master 02:35:26 Cool. It's going to take a tail attack against you, Jesse. What's, uh, is in concept? This bitch might do it? It's 16.
Cyrus Schwert 02:35:48 Come on. Lower than 15. No. Okay. Okay. Still half. Still half. It's pretty good. Eleven down. No. Vertal. Tragedy. I'm still. Oh. Tragedy. I'm still. Oh. Oh.
Kaladen Shash 02:35:52 Oh, he snuck through. It's a half damage? Oh, yeah. Here we go. Where is he at?
Dungeon Master 02:36:08 said 4 HP. Uh, damn. So close. You can tell it's working. He, like, the moon being, like, carves through part of its chest. Its tail attack is so desperate. It still gets advantage because of the velociraptor that's not dead yet. It can't use the tail attack on you.
Zariel Torgan 02:36:18 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 02:36:19 about it? Wait, I thought you said it can't use its tail because I'm grappled in it. Oh, fair, valid. If you attack someone else, so I'm dying in its mouth.
Kaladen Shash 02:36:40 It's
Dungeon Master 02:36:48 Dirty 20 to hit the Jesse wreck. And you take 26 points of legend and damage to you, Jesse, and then it's going to bite down on Cletus, who's in its mouth.
Zariel Torgan 02:36:52 Absolutely.
Cyrus Schwert 02:36:57 Well, that hits me now, right? Because you have it stopped. No. Please be low. Oh, that's a concept. No. No. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:37:11 Ooh. Cool. And makes no sense.
Dungeon Master 02:37:17 Because you were grappled at hits advantage. That is 25 hit. And that is 34 points of piercing damage.
Zariel Torgan 02:37:32 Oh. Oh.
Cyrus Schwert 02:37:36 Jesus. I'm alive. I'm so dead at the moment. I'm so dead at the moment. Oh, jeez.
Leopold Magnus 02:37:48 Off to see the hag.
Dungeon Master 02:37:49 You guys see like... One of Cleetus's arm is hanging from like this sinew. It's not off, but it's like barely attached as he goes unconscious. I mean, it's not realistically going to live through a round. It is going to try to bolt this way. Everybody can take an attack of opportunity.
Kaladen Shash 02:37:52 Mm-mm-hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 02:38:13 Opportunity attack. Even me? Am I still in its mouth? I sure. Oh shit. Chip does one damage, I think. Yeah. Plus five to hit one piercing damage. I hit him.
Dungeon Master 02:38:21 You could have, you could have Chiff make an attack. Yeah, that's all I was going to give him anyway. Right, I think anybody. Right, I think anybody's minimum would do it. We're just doing a group thing here.
Cyrus Schwert 02:38:42 My minimum damage would. Oh, roll it. I rolled almost 19 damage from Cyrus.
Dungeon Master 02:38:58 Jesse, did you just thorn whip as a T-Rex? Oh, shit. I did not know that. Let me get the Jesse back in there.
Zariel Torgan 02:39:01 Yeah, well, I was going to mention it, but I didn't want to ruin the flow. I failed my con save to maintain, and so I've revert back. But it just happened, and so I didn't want to, you know, roll big damage when I didn't have it.
Leopold Magnus 02:39:02 You know.
Kaladen Shash 02:39:17 16. I got to see.
Dungeon Master 02:39:21 I think everybody, it goes to runaway and you thorn whip its other leg, pull it out from it. It lays flat, hitting the ground, releasing Cletus, who is in its mouth. And then you guys just bear down, flashing it up until you, like, slash it at its spinal cord. It stops moving. And then one quick, like, stabbing shot from Cyrus into its lung. And it just sort of stops moving.
Leopold Magnus 02:39:49 It's like a gang beat down. Jesus. You should just let him die. I'm sure that teeth.
Zariel Torgan 02:39:49 What a feeling word, please. Just fast as I can. I learned my lesson from Leo, and it made me feel bad. You get 10 hit points. Damn, what did you roll that at?
Kaladen Shash 02:39:51 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 02:39:57 I also do it. I say, what you should have? As close to his ears as I can. 18.4. It's a fucking fourth level. It's been all day we've been walking around here. We're about to sleep again. Why not?
Dungeon Master 02:39:59 Well, Zario's turn after that, but he can do it before Cleus makes it out save.
Cyrus Schwert 02:40:27 Turn them. Hopefully we don't have another fight. Damn. That one was outy, yeah. That was crazy, dude.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:33 I don't know.
Dungeon Master 02:40:38 Yeah. Oh, I changed the music. There's still a Velocer after left. It only has 10 HP, so you guys would kill it by the end of the round. So anyway, you're out of combat. It's the end of the day. What do you guys want to do before you sort of bed down?
Leopold Magnus 02:40:58 Woo! What a day, huh fellas?
Kaladen Shash 02:41:03 of the day. Like me. I'm just, I'm just cutting peace.
Cyrus Schwert 02:41:03 I now have a real deep fear of whatever the fuck that was. It hated me real bad. What'd eat me. Caledon just walked through the woods today. He didn't take a single point of damage. My arm is slowly reattaching.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:03 Yeah, not bad.
Dungeon Master 02:41:10 It looks terrifying, right? Huge head, large thing.
Kaladen Shash 02:41:30 I'm just cutting very large piece of meat. I'm making campfire. I'm like, hey, that was fun adventure, you guys. I was really nice. I like the floorings a lot.
Leopold Magnus 02:41:30 I didn't either.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:34 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 02:41:38 You hear my quiet person eyes fall asleep. Chips go into town, sewing. He's going to town, sewing my arm back on. He's stuck sanitary, somehow.
Dungeon Master 02:41:39 Whistling? Do you guys want to... He's got his little gown on. He's got a lot of blood covering it. He's like wiping his face masks.
Kaladen Shash 02:42:03 We got tiny hot.
Dungeon Master 02:42:08 um yeah unless you guys have anything special before you go to sleep before you do that no this is sick as fuck let let trace cook
Cyrus Schwert 02:42:14 I cast Liam in's tiny hut. Don't do that. Okay. I would like to actually do... Okay. I pause it. I want... I stop you right there, Cyrus. I'm in pain. I want this to look cool.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:20 Not damn.
Leopold Magnus 02:42:23 Nice.
Kaladen Shash 02:42:42 I love that.
Cyrus Schwert 02:42:44 I brush my staff and I cast my willow tree form and I stick it into the ground and from it first a huge willow tree that in effect is Liam Munn's tiny hut. So for everything else it just looks like a tree but we're just under the branches under our fire. And then I pass the fuck out.
Zariel Torgan 02:43:14 It's
Cyrus Schwert 02:43:18 He just fell asleep after that. He stole my thunder and then he pulled away. That was way cool.
Dungeon Master 02:43:25 Yeah, it is, in effect, just a Liam and tiny hat that doesn't cost a spell level. He planes it into the ground and it turns to a 20 foot tall, five foot diameter willow tree. The bow sort of go all the way to the ground. So looking at it, it just looks like a willow tree.
Dungeon Master 02:43:42 Detect magic reviews just light transmutation magic. From the inside, it's ambiently lit and weather controlled. It's nice and warm. The lights are sort of these flickering fireflies that sort of turn on and off. Just sort of giving a low light throughout the whole thing. And Cleetus passes out leaning up against the three.
Cyrus Schwert 02:43:55 How did you know how did you know who did that? Tune. Did you just set that on the ground to turn into a tree?
Zariel Torgan 02:44:10 Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:44:17 Cyrus is always in disbelief.
Cyrus Schwert 02:44:25 You look at Chip. He's also slumped. It's literally a stick with an almond in it and it's just trying to do a tree. It's not an almond tree. Why would this not be an almond tree? Oh my God. It's so almond theme. Everyone's those. I was still asking some hysteria. Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. I just...
Kaladen Shash 02:44:37 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:44:40 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:44:43 Because this is, this is Cornelius' setup. He just, he made it an almond pet dispenser too, is what happened. He miders in his sleep talking to nobody.
Cyrus Schwert 02:44:53 Put almonds in the staff, but it is a willow stone. It's like a Pez dispenser, but almonds. I put Chip in the middle of it, and I just, like, pry his mouth or his head back, and a little almond pops out like a pez.
Zariel Torgan 02:45:10 Sure, sure, sir.
Dungeon Master 02:45:19 Everybody going to sleep. Everybody going to sleep? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.
Cyrus Schwert 02:45:22 It's so slobbered. It's so wet. I go to sleep. I need sleep bad. All right. Mm-hmm.
Kaladen Shash 02:45:39 Yeah, Jonathan, I was working on her, I was working on a ring. Can I keep working on that? Well, we have to meditate four hours. I can roll. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:45:39 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:45:40 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:45:46 We'll say you take like a first watch that effectively, even though you guys don't need a watch, but you spend some time. And you guys, yeah, and you guys have some funds now so you can fund your enchantment process. How much time do you want to spend on it?
Cyrus Schwert 02:46:07 Yes.
Kaladen Shash 02:46:12 I mean, if I only need to spend four hours, what time is it now? Is it like late late or is it like just evening? That's great. Yeah, I'll work until I work until like if we're going to get up at like 7 a.m. I'll work until like 3 a.m. and then do my four hour meditation for a bunch hours.
Dungeon Master 02:46:18 I would not say like if you guys are going, you're betting down at like six to eight o'clock at night. You're working to midnight at the latest. So no issue there. Okay. And then where are we in your progress? How much time have you put into this?
Cyrus Schwert 02:46:41 Oh, it's the shine.
Kaladen Shash 02:46:45 I was trying to look at my notes for that. I remember I got halfway. I was at like the halfway mark. I was trying to get shield into it. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:46:51 Okay, and then what are you trying to enchant into it? And Shield's first level spell? Okay, a total enchanting time of 32 hours. So you're halfway, so you're at 16. So you spend four more hours into it.
Kaladen Shash 02:47:16 another seven.
Cyrus Schwert 02:47:17 Thank you. Thank you very many.
Dungeon Master 02:47:20 Oh, you're spending a number seven. Oh, yeah, you're knocking some serious time. Okay. So that means you only have nine more hours. Go ahead and give me one DC-14, like, check, which is just your spellcasting modifier.
Kaladen Shash 02:47:52 Let's see, I think. No, it's a plus seven coming. It's just, it's like rattling really slowly. It's a roll to one.
Dungeon Master 02:47:58 Did you say you got a seven? It's not popping up on my screen. That's just one failure. So you have two successes, one failure. You just need three successes before you have the three failures.
Kaladen Shash 02:48:23 Okay, cool. Oh, man.
Dungeon Master 02:48:25 But if I remember right, and that one results in a mishap. Roll me a deep stick. Two.
Cyrus Schwert 02:48:26 What religious.
Leopold Magnus 02:48:50 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:48:51 You are sort of channeling the power into the ring, and for a brief second, the Arcana sort of slips, and one of your ruins turned out to not be perfectly etched like it needed to be, and the magic sort of backlashes and whips into your body, you are ejected like 10 feet, and you take 10 points of damage. A little bit of a setback. No damage to the product so far, though.
Cyrus Schwert 02:48:58 Thank you very compliment you might compliment you might fire
Kaladen Shash 02:49:22 Okay. That usually doesn't happen.
Leopold Magnus 02:49:26 Oh, careful, Caledon. Yeah. Well, you know, I'm in centuries rest, so I just wake up briefly, say that, go back to rest.
Dungeon Master 02:49:30 He says from his stasis. Yeah. Okay. And then Jesse and Bren pick higher or low. Justy picked low so you're high. 12. That's technically high.
Cyrus Schwert 02:49:33 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:50 Whoa.
Dungeon Master 02:50:01 So this will be Bren. Give me a momento. Yeah, I like that one. Okay. Calladin. It's been a while since anything has disturbed your sleep.
Dungeon Master 02:50:31 But as you have this sort of enchanting mishap, you also find your meditation a little bit troubled, a little bit hard to get into sleep at first. You have, would almost feel like first person visions almost follow like a description of what Cyrus and Cletus had told you about New New Arbor, the Southern Dome. You almost feel like you can experience it from somebody's perspective.
Dungeon Master 02:50:59 And the perspective you're seeing almost takes joy in it. There's like a deliciousness and watching all the destruction go down. And this is like the first couple hours as you're trying to go to sleep. You know, you're shaking your head, trying to get the thoughts to go away. And eventually they do. You find yourself...
Dungeon Master 02:51:18 in a meditative lull you start hearing the swaying of the grass and the boughs of the willow tree and you soon find yourself teleported to that same sort of
Dungeon Master 02:51:31 open golden field that you had found yourself in before and you see um like 200 feet away just like enough that you can see but far enough out that you can't like get too quickly seemed to be that woman that you haven't seen in a while but she's facing away from you what do you want to do
Cyrus Schwert 02:51:44 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:51:58 This is the one that told me I was like I was silly for not remembering everything or whatever. Right? Yeah. Okay. I try to, she's like 200 feet away. I think I would try to interact. I would run forward. Whoa.
Dungeon Master 02:52:08 You see this is the girl who turned a stone when they took the mask off her face, the one that you carry. Yeah. You move through the grass.
Dungeon Master 02:52:29 It takes you a long time. It almost feels like the closer you get is sort of stretches and she's just as far, but you keep pressing. And eventually you make your way and she's standing on the edge of a cliff almost. So you get up to her. She's still in front of you and facing away. But you see past her shoulder this huge domed city, enormous,
Dungeon Master 02:52:55 put in the center of this dense jungle, not even a forest, but like a full rainforest. It's got its own microbiome. There's a little clouds sort of accumulating on this outside of the dome. And on one huge face of the dome, you see the entire Arcona is split in crack, and it's this huge hole in the protective casing. You've realized pretty quickly that this is Moonhaven, and it's like,
Dungeon Master 02:53:24 you're seeing what was sort of shown to you through the scribe before that you had when you were sort of back at HQ. There is...
Dungeon Master 02:53:35 the water from like the surrounding area seems to be pulled up into the dome. So most of the dome is underwater. There's like parts of it. They're still out of the water. And again, so this is all down here. You are way back and up. You're looking down at it from a distance. So you see there's part of it that's
Dungeon Master 02:53:55 land and there's like these old buildings that are overrun with growth and stuff but it's so peculiar you are watching all of the water almost get sucked into it and you hear her in front of you again and not facing you just see the back of her head um just very quiet she goes you're so close can't you feel it
Leopold Magnus 02:54:16 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:54:19 Can't you smell it? And with that, you get a whiff of wildflowers again, the same thing you had sort of gotten before. And she's like, there. And she points at something nondescript, nothing specific, just towards the dome. She's like, there you'll find who you are.
Dungeon Master 02:54:39 And the wind blows, strong gust, all of the grass sort of blows to one side. And her form sort of explodes into flowers and just gets carried away by the wind. And you snap to it in like a cold sweat in like a cross-legged stance sitting underneath the willow tree. And you still smell wildflowers. And you all wake from your long rest.
Kaladen Shash 02:54:59 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:55:12 for day two of travel. How about this? How far were you guys? I'm going to say you guys were a week's travel away at good pace. You've gotten one full day down. If you have two of three checks during the day are successful, you can knock off an extra day, each sort of day that you travel distance-wise. A severe setback sets you back a day.
Cyrus Schwert 02:55:30 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:55:42 So you have tentatively six days left. But we're going to end there because it's 11. And then as you wake, you can tell them what you see. And just so Trace and Travis can see it because you guys have gotten a peek at it before your next location.
Zariel Torgan 02:55:54 All right.
Dungeon Master 02:56:12 it loads. We'll be that. And that's sort of what he describes to you in the morning.
Cyrus Schwert 02:56:18 It would be one.
Zariel Torgan 02:56:27 cool that's awesome
Dungeon Master 02:56:43 Nice, guys. Unfortunate encounter checks. I didn't expect. I don't like so many Nat 1s in the mix. I think this is only the second session at level 8. I think we'll have to do one more before I level you up again.
Kaladen Shash 02:56:48 Okay. So much XP, I'm not, we level up.
Leopold Magnus 02:56:57 Yeah, that was kind of wild. Making progress. What's that?
Cyrus Schwert 02:57:01 But I want to know what I wanted that. Yeah, really fucking sick. And I really wanted to...
Zariel Torgan 02:57:09 That's fair. Closer all the time.
Dungeon Master 02:57:22 Nice, nice thing. You're going to try a little bit.
Cyrus Schwert 02:57:32 We were trying to blow this stuff. I thought the T-Rex was super sick. I saw the Velociraptor, and I'm like, I really want to cast animal friendship on that. I want that. But then I... I chomp, so, yeah. And then I got munched, but that was okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:57:32 I can hear you now. That's funny. That's funny.
Zariel Torgan 02:57:48 Oh, this is.
Cyrus Schwert 02:58:01 It was cool, though. You know, it totally made sense. Yeah. It made sense for the, uh, making on their names, the hyena people. That was a lot.
Leopold Magnus 02:58:05 I generated a Leo Leo. Yeah. Yeah. What were you saying, Trace? Yeah, I thought it turned out pretty well. Yeah, definitely a little bit more adult.
Dungeon Master 02:58:06 Oh, sick. Oh, you did the... Oh, you did the... That's a sick. Yeah, there's like torture in his eyes.
Zariel Torgan 02:58:20 That's cool. Yeah, that was great. Yeah, that was great.
Dungeon Master 02:58:36 which is very fitting. Those are, that's cool. Cool. Oh, hell yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:58:40 wrapped in a basement, tortured.
Kaladen Shash 02:58:43 I do love the, I did like the T-Rexes that got posted in the chat.
Cyrus Schwert 02:58:51 Joe, Jesse, you're the shiny version, bro.
Zariel Torgan 02:58:55 Ha-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h.
Dungeon Master 02:59:00 Okay, so the next session will be not in person yet. That's still farther out, obviously, with all the bad weather. But it'll be like multiple travel days. So if you guys want to do anything specific,
Dungeon Master 02:59:16 Or if you're like, you want to do a certain amount of channing and you want to get ahead of it, we can speed up the whole travel thing. But if you get to me before that and you're like, hey, I would want to do this and this succession and we can like work it out through the week. Beyond that, I'll get, Rex, I'll get you a list of materials for the gun that you're building.
Leopold Magnus 02:59:40 Oh, yeah. Yeah, I actually was able to get that something glitched with the transcripts generation. But I got it working. So I'll be able to do all three pretty easily. Yeah, no worries.
Dungeon Master 02:59:40 And while you can, like, roll for it on your travel. And then if you wouldn't mind, could you get the session summaries up at some point? Okay. Okay, thank you. But beyond that, it's okay.
Cyrus Schwert 03:00:06 That's kind of growth. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 03:00:09 Isn't this that one fucking creepy, dude? It's like a... It's like a joker. Yeah. Yeah. Too evil. Yeah, too evil. Yeah. Maybe this one.
Zariel Torgan 03:00:10 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 03:00:13 Oh, that's, that's, that is a no thank you right there. That's true realistic.
Dungeon Master 03:00:16 It's like Pennywhite the clown. I like the first one. First one hits the mark.
Leopold Magnus 03:00:40 eyes aren't quite right though yeah thank you guys thank you guys appreciate it that was as always a lot of fun and i'll put the uh
Cyrus Schwert 03:00:46 Thanks for the game. All right. Thanks for the game. Combat's always.
Kaladen Shash 03:00:58 Yeah, good game. Yep, later guys.
Dungeon Master 03:00:59 You're welcome. Oh, well, actually, just real, really quick. On the downtime as you're going to bed that first night, would any of you have happened to have gone into the workshop at some point?
Zariel Torgan 03:00:59 Yeah, that was awesome. Yeah, I probably would have. Yeah, I probably would have, because I trained the duggies.
Leopold Magnus 03:01:26 Oh, what was I? Yeah. Hmm.
Dungeon Master 03:01:30 Cool. This works out perfect. As you go into the workshop to spend some more time with the wolves, you notice that the gold egg that you guys had placed in there is cracked at the top. Do you want to look at it?
Kaladen Shash 03:01:31 Yeah, it's Ariel. Let's go. Let's go. Next time, bum,
Cyrus Schwert 03:01:38 Oh, fuck. Bluff Hanger. Do you want to look at it? You want to look at it.
Zariel Torgan 03:01:49 Yeah, so I guess we'll, do you want to handle it now or do you want to deal with it next time? Um, yeah, I mean, it seems like you want me to. So yes, I will look at it.
Dungeon Master 03:02:05 I do want you to. You walk up and you look into there and you see it's not bad. In the base of the egg, it's hollowed out and it's metallic and it's textured, but there's no like amniotic fluid or anything and there's nothing crazy like that. But
Dungeon Master 03:02:21 sitting perfectly placed and fold at the bottom is that looks like a cloak, gold and brass trim around the neckline that disappears over the front of the chest and hanging in perfect layers coming off of it is a brilliant orange, black, and red, yellow sort of flaming feathers that come down in like a mantled cake.
Cyrus Schwert 03:02:44 Oh shit. Pick as far.
Kaladen Shash 03:02:46 Sweet.
Zariel Torgan 03:02:46 I'm going to pick that up and put it on so that I can see what it does. Okay.
Dungeon Master 03:02:55 Cool. I'll read it really quick. This is what we talked about before. We just, for some reason, you never checked on it. So I couldn't give it to you earlier. This is called embered main. It is an item that requires a tomb by a druid. While resistant from this cape, while wearing this cape, you were resistant to fire damage. It's got an ability called heat sensitivity. If you were subjected to a spell that inflicts fire damage, you had to have advantage on the save.
Kaladen Shash 03:03:17 What?
Dungeon Master 03:03:25 Enhanced fire aura. Once per day, when you wild shape into a beast, you can activate your enhanced fire aura as a free action. Your melee attacks gain 1D6 fire damage for the duration, and any creature that strikes you with a melee attack takes 1D6 fire damage. You decide which of these wild shape abilities this effect happens on. So it's not like Divide up, it's one or the other. You also can expend both of your wild shapes to transform into a fire elemental.
Dungeon Master 03:03:53 This ability is similar to the ability granted by the Circle of the Moon Druid, but more limited in that you can't change into multiple. And the description is, once the egg of the Great Fire Spirit has hatched, inside is the accumulation of its power and a part of the whole story can be understood.
Cyrus Schwert 03:03:58 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 03:04:11 the great fire spirit was presumably once a humanoid but whose true name had long since been lost to the winds of time originally hailing from the bounds of the west dome when the esoteric curse swept through the dome this being emerged as a powerful monstrosity who was later recruited into the ranks of the cursed king
Dungeon Master 03:04:31 By the time of Moonhaven had been sieged, the Great Fire Spirit was a gargantuan monster of immense power who had obtained the rank as one of the six great generals, working closely with the cursed king. When the war was eventually lost, the generals were scattered across the continent, and the Great Fire Spirit took roost on the western face of Drake's Roosz volcano, where it laid for over a century guarding its power.
Dungeon Master 03:04:59 So that'll be, I just wanted you to be able to read that before you guys got to the dome. So you kind of had a better understanding. And you guys can talk about that and ask questions next time. It's in the item. So in theory, you could go to Jesse's character page and look at that.
Leopold Magnus 03:05:10 Where is that description posted? Ah, okay. I will. That's awesome.
Dungeon Master 03:05:32 But other than that, that should get it. Thanks, Jesse. Thanks, Jesse. Have fun with your snow.
Leopold Magnus 03:05:35 Yeah, yeah. We killed some, uh, killed some things. Got some pretty good, uh, lore out there. Yeah. Thursday is the day. So. Yeah. Yeah. Good luck with the power outages.
Zariel Torgan 03:05:35 Awesome. Always fun. Oh, yeah. Yeah, next Thursday. Is that the plan? Sweet. All right. Sounds good. All right, guys. Have a good night. Thank you. I'll try. Yeah, hopefully that was the last one.
Kaladen Shash 03:05:39 Some things. Next Thursday. Yep. Later, guys.
Cyrus Schwert 03:05:49 Yep.
Leopold Magnus 03:06:04 Yeah. See you all later.
Dungeon Master 03:06:07 the uh,

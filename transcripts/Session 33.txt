Kaladen Shash 00:00:01 you
Leopold Magnus 00:00:01 Ha ha.
Dungeon Master 00:00:02 Great book. Absolutely gets stitches. You guys stand roughly at the entrance of the district where the ledge was. Looking in, the light is filtering in through the glass dome above you, so it's sort of distorted right away, but it filters through the multicolored trees, the pinks, the orange, the reds. It is very colorful and beautiful up here, and you know
Zariel Torgan 00:00:07 Yeah, he just got back to fucking... Who did?
Cyrus Schwert 00:00:07 I would fuck that video.
Dungeon Master 00:00:31 That in general, the Elarian District was sort of the governmental, more official section of Moonhaven. And so this was the location of the High Council Tower. Pardon me, I'm going to sneeze. The Core Tower and even like the teleportation in and out of the city. Oh, shoot.
Zariel Torgan 00:00:53 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 00:00:53 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 00:00:55 And so there's like a lot more there. There's like different businesses and things scattered about. Everything is very overgrown. You see bamboo shoots kind of springing up through everything. You don't have really clear sight of everything. It's so overgrown and jungly. But there's a couple of things you have to figure out. What happened? Why happened? What you're going to do next? So, oh, dears, what would you want to do to start your day?
Cletus Cobbington 00:01:24 This is a whimsical-ass jungle. Bamboo with pink trees next to it.
Leopold Magnus 00:01:35 Oh, Cyrus, that spider specimen you generated, that was some interesting material. Oh. Oh, I thought that was coming out of your ear. Oh, OK. I start crossing out the note that I took about the
Zariel Torgan 00:01:42 No. We're not giving him a second. Not right now.
Cyrus Schwert 00:01:44 I didn't really generate it. I feel like I kind of just scooped it up. Right? No, I don't have cum coming out of my ear, Leopold. No. I don't remember...
Cletus Cobbington 00:02:03 The cum was pretty good.
Dungeon Master 00:02:03 Cyrus Eaton. It's condensed unrefined weight fighter software.
Leopold Magnus 00:02:04 What did you say that stood for? I don't have a name in my journal to reference. I think it was, I think, yeah, something like that. C-U-M, what does that stand for? Condensed? Unrefer, ah.
Kaladen Shash 00:02:04 source of the comms. Yes. Moist spider silk, of course.
Cyrus Schwert 00:02:14 It's C-U-M-S-S. Condensed and unrefined. Right. Fucking no shit. It does.
Zariel Torgan 00:02:26 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:02:32 All right, I'm gonna update my inventory, because I do think I had a small sample of that. Yeah, to comes. Now, okay.
Dungeon Master 00:02:36 You did take like a vial of that, yeah. A little perfect.
Kaladen Shash 00:02:41 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:02:43 no you are not the father you
Cyrus Schwert 00:02:44 coming is what happens when a lady and a man love each other very much. And then they have a baby. There's like some on your hand from earlier.
Leopold Magnus 00:02:58 That seems quite inappropriate now that I think about it. I'm starting to scratch things out of my journal.
Zariel Torgan 00:03:13 So are we looting? I mean, we're looting, right? Yeah, I mean, I'm going to start, I mean, unless somebody else wants to do something else, like, as we're walking towards our destination, maybe kick open a door, take a peek inside, get a feel for whether or not this place was left, you know, like the purge and everything's gone, or left like it filled up suddenly and killed everybody. Do I need to make a roll or something for that?
Cyrus Schwert 00:03:16 We look around for carcasses.
Kaladen Shash 00:03:17 Anything that's left? Yeah. Right, right.
Dungeon Master 00:03:44 Yeah, we'll do all of it at once. So everybody just give me a general stealth check. We're going to do a group average. And then in addition, you can do a perception check or investigation checks. This will be a group average for anybody who's doing it. And then I've just got like a master list of things that you can find in this area. And you'll just pull, it's like a bunch of random shit. So it's not even guaranteed to be good.
Cyrus Schwert 00:03:45 I like that.
Kaladen Shash 00:03:47 I will...
Zariel Torgan 00:03:52 Nice stealth.
Cletus Cobbington 00:04:14 Nice. I just rolled a real dice and got a 20. I'm still laughing really loud after talking about ..
Cyrus Schwert 00:04:15 Cyrus is... Yeah, sure. What a crazy...
Kaladen Shash 00:04:22 Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:04:29 21, 25, 22. Great average. 26, 10, 19. Go ahead and one person roll 2d20s. Odd is bad. Even is good, but it's like with advantage. So if one of them is even, that's good. But if they're both odd, that's bad.
Cletus Cobbington 00:04:53 Cyrus got the 20.
Zariel Torgan 00:04:54 Not me. How'd you get a 2.6?
Leopold Magnus 00:04:55 Like a recessive dominant gene. Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:04:59 Yeah. Okay, so you guys are moving through. You seem unnoticed, and as you're moving about, it's eerie and kind of a little horrid in a beautiful way. As you're moving through buildings, everything is almost stuck in time, untouched.
Cyrus Schwert 00:05:04 Because college is harder than math.
Kaladen Shash 00:05:08 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:05:28 No sort of rotting or anything took place after like the war had ceased in the area, but everything is like destroyed, blown over.
Cletus Cobbington 00:05:30 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:05:37 fully abandoned, you walk past the skeletons of what look like people fleeing, except they're half burned into the ground, so it's like the top half of the torso is the only thing sticking out of the ground, and it's just bones. And you see skulls of their places, and tattered robes and stuff, and
Dungeon Master 00:06:00 all of it's overgrown with brush and foliage and flowers and stuff sticking out of the skull, things like that. And you are moving through this space and you don't find a whole lot, but with those checks, you would see... Let me get to my...
Dungeon Master 00:06:29 Good list. Somebody roll me two people can roll a d10, and you'll get two items on the list. Yeah, so two people roll a d10.
Cyrus Schwert 00:06:40 I did the 20s. I did the 20s.
Kaladen Shash 00:06:44 Or one of them. A 10, you said?
Leopold Magnus 00:06:44 How many do we need? Two people can roll a d10. I can roll another one. Oh, eight.
Cletus Cobbington 00:06:58 And.
Dungeon Master 00:06:59 care. Five. Eight. Okay. As you guys are going through these places, you find what looks to be like an old maybe magic shop. Most of it's gone. No inventory left, but you do see hanging on a coat wrap. There seems to be this like red hooded cloak that
Zariel Torgan 00:07:00 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:07:26 that at the base of it kind of billows, even though there's no wind in the shop, just kind of gently kind of flows and moves in place. The only thing sticking out in the room. And then in a different area, this like overgrown little alcove, there's like an abandoned messenger bag looking
Cyrus Schwert 00:07:41 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:45 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 00:07:49 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:07:56 um bag like that's like the best way to describe it but it's elven it's kind of druidic it seems to almost be like out of a very fine weave of like some sort of grass but you find this like little satchel sitting next to a bench and in it is a partially burned piece of paper and it has these like incomplete rune sequences and you stare at it for a while um
Dungeon Master 00:08:21 And it feels like it goes to something, but without the something, you don't think you'd figure it out. Like you instantly, like after looking at it, you're like, this isn't, I'm not going to sit here and try to decode this yet. I'm missing a huge piece of it. But like somebody was trying to get rid of it in a rush kind of deal. And that's kind of all you guys find as you move of importance. There are like clothing pots, pans, like,
Dungeon Master 00:08:47 like regular clothes, you find various coins, nothing worth more than like 10 gold total, but like various coppers and brass and things like that. Everybody seems to be running. That is like dead. All of the bodies are facing further down the path as if they were running for a certain thing. But what you guys continue and kind of go is up to you.
Zariel Torgan 00:09:11 you you
Leopold Magnus 00:09:15 Hey, Jonathan, would we have seen any libraries or books or any bits of papers gathered about while we were looking? OK.
Dungeon Master 00:09:23 Nothing that you found that seems like of important or has lasted. You see like a shop that looked like a bookshop, but it's completely incinerated. There's nothing of use. And so you're moving through and you're like, I can't seem to find the area that I'm looking for.
Kaladen Shash 00:09:38 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:09:40 And it kind of occurs to you with how good your checks were before. I'll just kind of let it keep rolling. In New New Arbor, the legionnaire at the core, the center building of the city, there was a library in there. So you might find something similar if you head to like the central tower of the city, which is in this district. It's like where the high council was based.
Zariel Torgan 00:09:43 Is there a haberdashery?
Leopold Magnus 00:10:09 And for hats.
Dungeon Master 00:10:12 Is that herbs and stuff? Perhaps. Roll me a d20. 11 or higher, yes. 10 or lower, no. Don't matter. You know, you're looking around and
Cyrus Schwert 00:10:14 Same question. Noah's hat. Those odds are incredible. Much better. That is so...
Kaladen Shash 00:10:19 You must wear it. Oh.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:20 We're in the fancy part of town, right?
Cletus Cobbington 00:10:28 Wow. That's a good odd. No.
Dungeon Master 00:10:41 Despite all of the death around you, you're just kind of, like, stepping over bodies looking for this hatchet. And you don't see anything here, but it kind of occurs to you that maybe when the water levels fully recede, you could go to, like, the Market District, which is, like, I believe it's the Tulip District, like, down in the base of the city, if you wanted to. But nothing up here.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:06 All right. I'll just... Are you guys thinking that we want to just find this thing first thing and then look around a little bit, do what we want to do, and then take off? Or do you want to just...
Kaladen Shash 00:11:09 Jonathan, is this where we think, or do we know exactly where the teleportation circle is? Yeah. OK. All right.
Dungeon Master 00:11:17 You don't know exactly, but you know it's in this district. You guys would find it eventually if you went looking for it.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:35 look around and then, you know, I don't know, what do you guys want to do?
Leopold Magnus 00:11:40 yeah i guess my thought is is if we locate it and then we get in trouble later we know how to get back pretty easily um and then also i kind of had a passing thought that maybe we could modify where that circle lands us is that possible at all like is that something that you can change like if i for instance found some materials could we enchant that circle to direct it somewhere near where it's at but in a slight like a different location
Kaladen Shash 00:11:59 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:12:03 Leopold, you found that piece of paper. Give me an intelligence check with advantage.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:18 Condensed unrefined spider silk? Or moist spider silk? Okay. Just a straight intelligence check. Natural 20 and a 19. Damn.
Cyrus Schwert 00:12:18 If you get certain materials like, I don't know, almonds or spider silk cum pillows, like who knows? Maybe you can do anything. Yeah. That's nuts.
Cletus Cobbington 00:12:24 Is there a dream where you could do anything?
Kaladen Shash 00:12:30 My service.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:41 Ah, damn.
Dungeon Master 00:12:44 I love this this is so great what a great moment you have this thought like can we alter a teleportation circle destination and then you look and you like go to scratch your head and you like do this and you look down you still have the parchment in your hand and you kind of hold it back and it looks like
Leopold Magnus 00:13:06 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:13:06 in a circular distribution changed runes along a circle to an established circle somewhere and you put it together with a natural me dc was 25 i didn't realize you only had a five um so you only hit it with that um not only
Dungeon Master 00:13:27 Can you do that with enough pass checks? A very talented wizard could probably do something like that. This thing that you found seems to be some sort of work in progress alteration. And you don't know where yet.
Dungeon Master 00:13:45 But you have like the means to make that possible. If you hadn't found that and put it together, you guys, if you had thought of this before, I'd already kind of planned this out. It would have taken you a couple days of like constant work on Kaladin's end to like figure out how to change the circle for this. And you've made it possible in like a couple checks.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:09 Cool. Badass. Yeah, so I guess maybe I'll just pretend it was stuck to my hand and I'm kind of trying to flutter it off.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:10 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:18 As we're walking along, I'm just trying, what the hell is this thing stuck in it? That piece of paper flips up in the wind and then just gets caught straight on my visor. And I really can't see. And I'm trying to still. And I bend over to Zario. And I'm like, Zario, I seem to be occluded here. Would you mind helping me out? And I bend down, asking him to get that piece of paper out of my visor.
Cyrus Schwert 00:14:18 Good work.
Dungeon Master 00:14:38 I'm good for you. This is going to be so engraved into the summary.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:42 Yeah, I'll grab it and it'll just pull and be a big, long, stretchy line of nasty. And I'll just. Yeah. So just real quick. We're making a lot of cum jokes. Your character is a child, right?
Leopold Magnus 00:14:50 Yeah, it was this condensed, unrefined, moistened spider silk got stuck to that piece of parchment. It's now, yeah. And I'll kind of bend down, yeah. Like a young adult, I think young adult, like adolescent teen,
Cyrus Schwert 00:14:54 I didn't know that adventuring was going to be so nasty.
Kaladen Shash 00:14:58 You can say the character's been changing. I think at one point he said like 17, 18.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:10 Like, we established that you have to look at small child. Oh, okay. That's better. All right. That makes me feel... Yeah. Yeah. This campaign's been, like, a month. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:15:11 No, no.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:23 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I still don't know if I put that. I just learned what come was, you know, so it's not like I was late. Yes, that's how I've been playing. I'm a late bloomer because I think that would be funny.
Cyrus Schwert 00:15:25 Yeah, it's been like three weeks. He's probably 19 by now. You don't have a dick. How are you supposed to know?
Kaladen Shash 00:15:29 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:15:30 I think it's been over a month in-game now. You guys took some time off. This is a late blooval.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:42 Well, you gotta be younger than 19. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Whales.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:54 Yeah. But anyways, I kind of bend down and I'm like, oh, Zario, this here seems actually pretty interesting. I can't believe I missed it. And then I'll describe to the group that we might have a shot. Oh, what would you go for if you're looking for something?
Zariel Torgan 00:16:10 Fortuitous. Too bad there wasn't a hat. Well, when I'm a bear, I have this sweet, like, round hat, but in my normal self, I got no hat. I've become very self-conscious about the shape of my head now that I have no hair or skin. So...
Cletus Cobbington 00:16:34 Sounds good.
Kaladen Shash 00:16:36 Yeah. Awesome.
Leopold Magnus 00:16:39 Yes. Oh, indeed. He's just smooth like metal, right? You're like the Terminator after the skin gets melted off. Yeah. Oh, geez.
Cyrus Schwert 00:16:39 He's balding, a balding robot. But the skin's only melted off in, like, the horseshoe. Exactly.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:49 Yeah. Yeah. A guy can dream. If a male pattern baldness. Oh, that's somehow way worse. Well.
Dungeon Master 00:16:51 it would just take like
Cletus Cobbington 00:17:05 Oh.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:12 So should we take a look at the circle to see if we need any supplies or would that be known what we're looking for, Jonathan? Okay. Got it.
Dungeon Master 00:17:21 stuff that you could make with your artificing and your magical tinkering so like paladin is a wizard and you as a wizard could work together to change the runes needed when you found the right circle it is created for a specific one you would know that much every teleportation circle is set to like certain locations when they're set in stone like that and they can be received to and you can go to different ones but you have to find the one that this is like adjusted for
Dungeon Master 00:17:51 if you're looking for a specific one. But you guys, if you kept going, eventually would find the Teleportation Tower. It is, if you're looking at the map, this one right here. That is the Core Tower, yes.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:51 Cool.
Kaladen Shash 00:18:09 And then Jonathan Wichita was the one that might have a library in it. Is it this large one over here? Wait. We should poke around in there.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:23 Yeah, absolutely. Do we get the impression that there's anything else alive in here? Have we heard anything? I can make a perception check or something, or...
Leopold Magnus 00:18:25 Oh, indeed. Knowledge is power.
Dungeon Master 00:18:29 Okay, everybody, give me another round of stealth checks. Like, there's... No, you guys' perception check earlier was really great. So it's got to count for all the passive stuff. You distinctly didn't hear anything. Like...
Cyrus Schwert 00:18:34 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:18:40 Yeah, we're really long.
Dungeon Master 00:18:53 In the other areas, when you're out in the wild, even when you didn't see anything, there's constant bird sounds and insect chirping and things like that. In this area, there's the rustle of the wind moving between buildings. Sometimes you get a slight whistle out of a bamboo reed split when it goes through, but there is no real other sound other than your footsteps echoing in the large, empty space. Eerily quiet here.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:11 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:19:28 18, 24, 14, 4, 26. What does that average at? Like 16-ish? Yeah, at some point you long rested.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:45 Oh, do we long rest, Jonathan? Okay, I think... Yeah, I'm full health. Well, if it comes down... Oh, go ahead. I was just going to say, if it comes down to it, I was going to change items.
Kaladen Shash 00:19:48 Yes. I've got all my spell slots right now, just like Jonathan said in the story.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:52 Oh, did we? Oh, no, I'm not. No, I'll do it right now.
Cletus Cobbington 00:19:57 That was the end of the last discussion, I think.
Leopold Magnus 00:20:14 infused items and then I would have I think advantage or I would be flat on disadvantage for stealth cool
Dungeon Master 00:20:22 You would have had a chance to do that. Yeah, that was why you guys all took a long rest with your prep. You guys had a good average. Go ahead and give me the same two D20 rolls where you're hoping for an even.
Cletus Cobbington 00:20:39 Cowan is highest. Mm-hmm.
Kaladen Shash 00:21:01 2D20s, is that what I'm doing? Yeah, check that.
Dungeon Master 00:21:03 Just 2d20s. Hoping one of them isn't even. Nice, 12. Great. You guys, it is about something like close to midday. You've been walking around towers, going through buildings, doing all these little side things. Sort of hitting the midday. Which direction did you guys want to head in? But nothing hinders your way.
Cletus Cobbington 00:21:10 you
Zariel Torgan 00:21:13 This.
Kaladen Shash 00:21:38 I mean, do we think there's anything? I mean, let's go check the building, right? Everything else has been pretty decayed or probably lost the time, but there's something of importance and there's not at all. Okay. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:21:45 Yeah. Heading towards the core town. Nice. As you guys are walking up, it's like more of a
Zariel Torgan 00:21:50 Well, magic stuff doesn't decay. So if there was anything, it'd be there. So yeah, let's take a look.
Leopold Magnus 00:21:50 I was thinking, yeah, take a look.
Cletus Cobbington 00:21:57 And.
Dungeon Master 00:22:12 like overgrown grove type area like the trees cover most of the light you go into this dark space um i have this is a multi-leveled map so i have general floor plans that are just like a bunch of different generic levels so
Dungeon Master 00:22:28 You can ask if the stuff on the map is really there or not, but in general, it's not. Each room is like a different theme. I'll describe it, and if you want clarification, I will. But as you walk into the main entrance, you notice that the high tower...
Kaladen Shash 00:22:38 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:22:44 core building doesn't have like doors properly it's like archways that are overgrown with like ivy and vines and different like foliage to kind of make it difficult but after you chop your way in and you sort of step into the the low lit open space a recording kicks on um like an automated message and what it says is welcome
Dungeon Master 00:23:12 Failsafe, unfortunately, still in place. To continue, please speak truth and pass. Fail and be held as authorities are called. There's a long pause. And then it says, I have cities but no houses, forests but no trees, rivers but no water. What am I?
Dungeon Master 00:23:35 And you see lining the whole room on the ceiling, down certain cracks on the side and the floor. There's like a thrumming blue arcana waiting for an audible answer. Rivers, but no water. Yes, I can. I can copy and paste.
Cyrus Schwert 00:23:48 What was the third thing?
Leopold Magnus 00:23:49 yeah I was just wondering if you could type it in the chat that way that'd be awesome
Kaladen Shash 00:23:52 No rivers, but I've had rivers, but no water.
Cletus Cobbington 00:23:59 Look now what?
Zariel Torgan 00:24:03 I think... Yeah. I think we're looking at one, aren't we? Right? Like it's a map, isn't it? Because it depicts them...
Leopold Magnus 00:24:24 um oh yeah cities but no houses forests but no trees yeah a map yeah that's a good one
Kaladen Shash 00:24:30 You think it's a map? It's loud enough so it just registers. What did you say? What are you saying?
Dungeon Master 00:24:33 Do you say map? The blue glowing line switches to green and you feel like a magic presence that had kind of been welling up dulls and subsides.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:34 But it's not, yeah. I don't. I'll nudge somebody and say, I think it might be on my app.
Cletus Cobbington 00:24:47 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:24:51 Matthew definitely got it.
Dungeon Master 00:25:05 And you hear another little automated message that says, welcome to Core Tower. Please be advised individual levels of high council still armed, but permission to tunnels between granted. Enjoy your stay. And then it like signs off with a little beep.
Dungeon Master 00:25:27 And you guys are left. The entryway doesn't actually look like this, but you see at the far end of the circular room, which is like 40 feet edge to edge on all sort of round. It's pretty round in general. There are like some tables and chairs that like mark an entryway. There is like, you can tell like where posts were. There's like,
Dungeon Master 00:25:48 Little counters that have nobody behind in the rooms. A singular door on the back and a broken chandelier hangs in the center of the room. The few windows there are are mostly overgrown with foliage. There's only a little bit of light that kind of filters in, but pretty empty room as far as you can tell.
Leopold Magnus 00:26:14 Jonathan, did that give us... Yeah. I was just curious, did that give us the understanding, the overview of the whole place? Did it serve as a map? Or did it just unlock? Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:26:14 What does she mean by armed?
Dungeon Master 00:26:26 No. It was just, it just lets you pass through the room.
Leopold Magnus 00:26:33 Right. I was just wondering, I mean, this thing seems like it's an enchantment of some kind. Could I do an Arcana check on it and see if maybe I could extract some information from it?
Cletus Cobbington 00:26:38 And.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:44 Jack that security system.
Dungeon Master 00:26:48 An arcana check wouldn't do it. There is, if you had to deck magic, you could cast that. There's some other things you can do, but it is a magical tower. The space on the inside is, like, slightly bigger than the space on the outside. You have, there's obviously, like, arcana wired through the whole thing with, like, the blue glow that you saw. And, like, it had said fail safe was active, meaning, like, the building was trapped.
Dungeon Master 00:27:17 And you have granted yourself access to the center, but like, there's nothing to sort of ascertain by just looking around. So like a pretty straightforward room that is enchanted.
Leopold Magnus 00:27:29 OK. Oh, Kaladin, what do you think about this place?
Cyrus Schwert 00:27:34 There's an ADT sign in the lawn out front.
Cletus Cobbington 00:27:40 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:27:46 Can I perform tech magic?
Dungeon Master 00:27:51 Yeah, detect magic reveals kind of what was not just under suspicion, but kind of confirmed. There is heavy abjuration magic in the area, which would be like protection spells. So you had a feeling that if you had answered incorrectly, you're looking at the floor, and it maps out in square sections on the floor that you can't be seen with the naked eye.
Dungeon Master 00:28:19 And like in detecting the magic and everything you can tell it's not like an identifier doesn't tell you exactly what it is, but this is like held in place. If you answered wrong, a tile would probably drop, but you don't know what's below.
Kaladen Shash 00:28:39 would convey all of that to the group just be careful there seems to still be very much active um she mentioned in the message that certain levels are still armed or active right like she said okay oh yeah i think where there might be some goodies stored or like where they perform a business
Zariel Torgan 00:28:39 Council levels. Yeah, it said the tunnels were open, right?
Dungeon Master 00:28:54 Yeah. There is a exit on the other side of the room. It's the only exit is like a stairwell going up.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:11 They were not armed anymore. Now do we see any any exits here? Well, what do you guys think? Yeah, let's go. Cyrus says tired almonds.
Kaladen Shash 00:29:26 Yes, let us climb.
Cyrus Schwert 00:29:26 I'd like to walk up it. I look for snacks left behind. Box of Cheez-Its. I don't know. A Ziploc and a Top Ramen bag. Yeah. That would be nice.
Dungeon Master 00:29:32 as you hit the nothing on the first floor but as you hit the second floor everybody sort of give me you give me a perception
Zariel Torgan 00:29:43 Yeah, anything processed. And he's
Cletus Cobbington 00:29:46 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:29:53 Everybody else just sees this as you walk into the room. The second floor, as you walk in, is floor-to-ceiling scrolls. Fill the walls, the entire thing sectioned off different areas. And in front of you, a magic plaque that is sort of being projected from unseen sources to kind of fill out something floating in space is this little thing that says, knowledge has a price.
Kaladen Shash 00:30:03 Oof.
Dungeon Master 00:30:20 And you get, once you read it, you recognize that in the room you feel different thrums and hums and like auras from different scrolls and different areas. And the whole area seems like there's something you can't tell is going on, but a lot of magic presence. Cyrus, did you give me a check?
Cyrus Schwert 00:30:45 No. Like perception or something? Insight? I'm looking for my favorite comics. Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:30:49 Just a perception check.
Dungeon Master 00:31:02 You're sort of looking through and you don't find any food. You find like what the elven equivalent of a Ziploc baggie that had food at one time just on a desk. Like it's been empty for so long it's just not there. Like a little woven leaf that has like a slipping thing.
Leopold Magnus 00:31:03 No.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:15 or where it's
Cyrus Schwert 00:31:19 I don't think I like anything anymore. Sounds cunty.
Dungeon Master 00:31:21 But in the process, you're looking around for some comics and stuff, and you see a little name plaque on a very modest-looking desk towards the entrance of the room, looking into the whole space. And it says, Muriel Miststroud, Lord High Healer.
Leopold Magnus 00:31:46 Hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 00:31:49 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:31:50 You know Lord High Healer is a position on the High Council. There are five lords and then the High Council.
Cyrus Schwert 00:31:51 Lord High Healer. Yes. For sure. She's a queen. Okay. There's probably some healing stuff here. There's either high heals here or there's pretty powerful spells somewhere in here. One of the two.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:56 Yeah, it's spelled with two E's. Both equally good.
Kaladen Shash 00:32:09 This is this. And this is her office. Jonathan's. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:32:20 I could fuck up a pair of red bottoms, to be honest. It would look sick. Does anyone have a detect magic or something like that? If we touch a scroll, are we going to be fucked?
Cletus Cobbington 00:32:28 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:32 Do we see anything around that that would seem relevant? Is there a desk? A drawer? Can I just...
Dungeon Master 00:32:38 You see a fuck ton of unmarked scrolls. Nothing is labeled. There's nothing like that. This seems like a private little area. So there's nothing like you could read. Maybe. What's that to do with the war? There's a desk. That's what Cyrus found.
Kaladen Shash 00:32:49 This is her office. Yeah. Can I walk up to some of the bookshelves? I don't want to touch anything yet, but can I, is there any labeling system? Is there any organization to it that we can see?
Dungeon Master 00:33:12 No, but it seems almost intentional that way. And you know that from what the message said, that this is probably what it means by, like, armed. Like, this seems like a test to be given access to the inventory.
Dungeon Master 00:33:33 Very kind of like Fae bullshit-esque, because Moonhaven is very based in its roots in Fae culture, and the High Council is like the foremost of those. So you wouldn't even necessarily need to know, but you could probably make a pretty good guess that this person was Elven, just from the name and the fact that it's Moonhaven.
Kaladen Shash 00:33:35 Mm hmm.
Zariel Torgan 00:34:01 I'm going to try to open the desk.
Dungeon Master 00:34:03 Who wants to do what? No, but you can give me an Arcana check if you want.
Kaladen Shash 00:34:05 I don't think so. Jonathan, do I feel anything like before, like the pulse? Yes, I will.
Leopold Magnus 00:34:07 Gallatin, do you have any connection here? Do you feel any draw to these papers? I'd assist with that. I was just wondering, is there any rhyme or reason to the frequency hums? Like, can you discern a pattern? Or are they all just kind of random?
Cletus Cobbington 00:34:17 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:34:36 No, it seems intentionally random. Guessing at random would be the most probable that you could equally pick something good and bad without assistance. Picking at random is not good. Okay. DC goes from 14 to 12 with the aid of Leopold.
Leopold Magnus 00:34:39 Okay. Okay. Yeah, I guess I'll just help Kaladin out. I'll try to stick my antenna in the air and pick up a frequency. See if I can catch something.
Cletus Cobbington 00:35:03 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:35:05 Caleb, give me that Arcana check. Ooh. On the money. It wasn't an incredibly hard thing. Everybody being cautious not to touch something was sort of the key there. You're sort of like...
Kaladen Shash 00:35:10 Oh my God. Needed it. Jeez.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:12 wow.
Leopold Magnus 00:35:14 Damn. Oh yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:35:28 you were doing the thing where you expected to feel the draw, but by like closing your eyes and shutting everything out and you kind of focus on the magic present, you feel like a, like an invisible guitar string plucking continuous, like the sound waves in a very melodic way, pull you up.
Dungeon Master 00:35:46 like silently to, as you get up to it, you see a old sort of decrepit skull that seems to be giving off in like a very light humming sound. It gives off like a harmless divination magic and you feel as though you have found the scroll that you're supposed to grab.
Kaladen Shash 00:36:06 I will reach out and grab the one that I am drawn to.
Dungeon Master 00:36:12 You grab it. I didn't pick a specific word out, but you just read something in Elven and you feel the whole room kind of calm down. Like if anxiety was something that you could feel, the whole room had an anxious state before you say that. And then everything sort of just relaxes. And you guys have sort of free roam of the room if you're looking for anything sort of specific.
Kaladen Shash 00:36:36 Okay, I think that did it. Yes. Can I just pull out random scrolls and get a feel for, are these all going to be like restoration healing?
Zariel Torgan 00:36:39 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:36:54 They seem to be random. Some of it's just general recounts and billing logs. Some of them are truly useless. But in looking for stuff, your DC-12 doesn't get you all of the good stuff. But you do see that there is another scroll that seems to be not affected by...
Kaladen Shash 00:37:10 Yeah, can I reach that one?
Dungeon Master 00:37:20 the passage of time. Like most of the things in here aren't magical and they're sort of deteriorating on the edges and splitting and browning. You see a scroll that looks almost perfect tucked below like a staff. Yeah, you grab that and this is the second part to the room puzzle. You grab this scroll and you feel
Dungeon Master 00:37:50 as like the reward for the room, like your little, the puzzle solution reward, is this scroll can be turned into one time only, and you have to decide now. To take it out is to decide what the scroll becomes. You have the choice between a scroll of teleportation,
Zariel Torgan 00:38:11 Yeah, we don't have teleport. We should definitely. It's even better.
Dungeon Master 00:38:12 You can get it to turn into four scrolls of Healing Word at base level. It'll be like four uses. Or you can get two scrolls of Scrying. Not even Teleportation Circle. This is Teleport.
Leopold Magnus 00:38:30 Yeah, what do you... What are the requirements for that spell? What level do you have to be? Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:38:31 Oh, teleportation circle. It's a spell. I don't think we even have. Oh, teleport. Yeah. It's a role for how well you know the area.
Zariel Torgan 00:38:42 100%. I think I can screw it. And I still don't check on him.
Cyrus Schwert 00:38:42 With Scrying, we could check on the dogs.
Dungeon Master 00:38:49 Yeah, it's a higher chance of getting there. And I believe Teleport is an 8th level spell. So the fact that you can't cast it yet would require some Arcana checks. But somebody who has access to that spell in their class can try to cast it through a scroll by doing extra to do it. It is possible.
Leopold Magnus 00:39:01 Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That spell would be pricey.
Dungeon Master 00:39:16 He could do that, but then there's also the draw in that wizards can copy spells for just the cost of gold equivalent. So you could, in theory, hold on to this. You could take every spell.
Kaladen Shash 00:39:22 Yeah. It would just take some time. That's an eighth level. That's not terrible. It's a, that's like two days, but it would be, I would just need to put it in my spell book and then it might just have like a higher role for success.
Leopold Magnus 00:39:34 Are you going all in on enough wizard to learn that? Oh, seriously? OK.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:35 Yeah, and I've got the other words of this.
Dungeon Master 00:39:47 You would learn the spell. And if you put it in your spell book, you couldn't cast it. You'd have to wait until you have access to 8th level spells. But if you, as a wizard, tried to cast it off of the scroll, you would make the equivalent of a controlled arcana. When you do counter spell or dispel magic, there's the DC 10 plus the spell level to cast it. It would be a DC 18 spell.
Kaladen Shash 00:40:09 yeah yeah that's great i mean just having that having having that as an option just to get us back if we can't manipulate the circle like you think or out or out or out quick if we need
Cyrus Schwert 00:40:09 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:40:16 like Arcana modifier check to do it.
Leopold Magnus 00:40:22 Nice. Yeah, do it, man. Yeah. That's like in a case of emergency. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:40:32 You see, as you make that decision, a little blue ribbon forms around the scroll. And clouds sort of decorate the outside. And you see the scroll has taken its final shape. And you can add a teleportation scroll or a scroll of teleportation into your inventory, however you want to word it. And with that, you kind of feel that that's all that there is in the room, unless you want to meticulously look for something very specific.
Dungeon Master 00:41:01 Or if you want to make a general check and hope for a wild success. Otherwise, you guys see that the stairs on the other side of the room sort of is guiding you up to the next level. Yeah, like just random paperwork.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:12 Jonathan, I had one thing I wanted to ask you about. You said there were some kind of trivial pieces of paper flying around. One was about accounts and one billing, something like that. Would any of those scrolls with accounts or billables, like, is that pertaining to local businesses in the town? Like, what were they keeping track of?
Dungeon Master 00:41:35 nothing that I'd planned but yes like it would just be general like tax revenue accounting things like that just like intentionally placed in here as like fodder just random shit to distract you if you had a specific question of like
Dungeon Master 00:41:55 Is there a store of money somewhere in the town? You could probably try to roll for something like that, knowing that. But I just have basically that there is a ton of stuff in here. And if you want to look for something very specific, it just needs to be like a pretty high roll.
Leopold Magnus 00:42:10 Okay, yeah, I'm going to try and pull one from the archive. I think there's a Pat's Hats in Moonhaven, if I remember. And I'm going to look for Pat's Haberdashery. It was a what check? A history check. Yeah. Oh, baby. 23.
Kaladen Shash 00:42:12 Take a chance.
Dungeon Master 00:42:24 Give me a history check. That'll be intelligence, right? You might be proficient in that.
Dungeon Master 00:42:39 Yeah, 23. You are going through the billing and you find transactional receipts on a return for something that somebody didn't like that had to be documented between a patron and Pat's Haberdashery, which is in the Tulip District.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:39 nice franchise
Leopold Magnus 00:43:02 Nice. And I'll kind of have my magnifying glass out and turn around as the paper turns to dust. And I'll say, Azariel, oh, there is a Pat's Hats here. Weren't you looking for something? Or maybe you too, Cyrus. Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:43:09 I was just going to turn to show people what it disintegrates as you move.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:22 Yeah, I'm pretty excited about that. He just... That's a Zapaterian.
Cyrus Schwert 00:43:24 Maybe you have to have high heels. I don't actually wear high heels. That was a joke. Then no. Then I'm fine.
Kaladen Shash 00:43:28 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:43:31 Well, I don't remember Spats Hats selling anything else but hat wear. Headgear. The low-end... Okay, cool. Excellent.
Dungeon Master 00:43:40 That would be in the Larendel district. That's the technical name. L-I-R-E-N-D-E-L. Larendel.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:54 Cyrus, do you want to take a field trip where you and I go get hats while these guys look for stuff? Yeah. A good hat store has snacks.
Cyrus Schwert 00:44:00 Yeah, probably. That feels like more my... Like, all this adventuring and, like, no snacks has really been getting to me. For sure. That's true. Yeah. What'd you say? I opened the door again.
Kaladen Shash 00:44:00 yes and just look at them you both look like you could really use a break like please go go do what you need
Cletus Cobbington 00:44:10 I shed a tear after he says there's been no snacks I have a bag of trail mix in my hand
Leopold Magnus 00:44:19 Just all almond. They always settle to the bottom.
Dungeon Master 00:44:20 They're already sort of on their way out when you say this. Anybody who wants to go with me... We'll do... We'll do...
Zariel Torgan 00:44:24 doors swinging. Sweet. It's just all almond, like one M&M. Sweet.
Cyrus Schwert 00:44:35 your trail mix is mostly almonds I don't want that there's like no M&M's
Kaladen Shash 00:44:35 it's only on it's just regular toasted boiled
Cletus Cobbington 00:44:39 and in fact it's all in the almonds trail mix
Dungeon Master 00:44:45 We'll do level three, and then we'll get to you guys on your little side mission. As the rest of the party travels up to the next level, this doesn't seem to be like you're looking around. The first thing you notice as you walk in is the spell that's trapping this room seems to be there are six glass cubicle sort of cages stacked together.
Dungeon Master 00:45:11 in front of you with like the rest of the room is behind it so it's a circular room a glass set of cages in the center and it's like projections of different creatures portrayed in them really fuzzy you can't super tell um and that's it in this room that you can see
Kaladen Shash 00:45:28 You said they were projections inside the glass cages, not actual features? Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:45:32 Yeah, it's like a little image of a creature you can't super make out. It just kind of hovers in place. And in the center, sorry, two more things. In the very center of the whole setup is an empty one. And on the far corner is a empty one that is broken, like something had shattered the glass to get into it or to get out of it. But nothing else that you can see.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:58 And that still looks like that glass shattering happened forever ago. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:46:03 Yeah. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:46:08 I have a question, but I'm not there. I'm not looking for a hat.
Leopold Magnus 00:46:12 What? Oh, Cletus, you suppose you recognize any of these animals?
Cletus Cobbington 00:46:21 I look real hard at these animals. Do I recognize any?
Dungeon Master 00:46:30 Let me get to the right thing. You would, without having to make a check, be very familiar with the forms of a couple of them, just with your connection to nature. One of the creatures is large, serpent-like, with some humanoid features, and you would know this to be a creature called a naga.
Kaladen Shash 00:46:31 you
Dungeon Master 00:46:51 And another one that you would see that you would recognize is a large like falcon mixed with vulture kind of anatomy, but like a huge bird form. And it's something that you've fought a version of before, but this is a rock, an ROC, like a large bird. And those are the two that you just know off the top of your head.
Cyrus Schwert 00:47:08 Break him out. Who?
Leopold Magnus 00:47:08 You know, in a past life, I knew a pretty funny Naga.
Kaladen Shash 00:47:12 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:47:12 A bird man and a snake man. How many were there? Not good.
Dungeon Master 00:47:39 It's a callback to the other campaign. What the fuck was his name? Does anybody remember off the top of their head? No. What would somebody like to do?
Leopold Magnus 00:47:41 Zander, yeah, maybe something. I don't remember. Oh.
Kaladen Shash 00:47:42 no I don't you
Cyrus Schwert 00:47:44 We'll see.
Zariel Torgan 00:47:53 Isn't it Xanaror? I should remember, but I don't.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:06 Can I take a pass of that broken glass, the kind of broken component of the teleporter? Intelligence saving throw.
Cletus Cobbington 00:48:13 you
Dungeon Master 00:48:14 Yeah, as you walk up to it to go check that one spot, you give me a DC 16 intelligence saving throw.
Cyrus Schwert 00:48:29 Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:48:31 Activated the defenses.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:35 Oh, gee, how do I get to my... Oh, there it is. Oh, damn, dude. That's tough. You said 16, didn't you?
Dungeon Master 00:48:46 um leopold in an instant you are yeah it is a 16 you are swapped and the whole party sees this but you don't because you go into a state of stasis you are put into the free cube as go ahead and roll me a d6
Leopold Magnus 00:49:05 OK. I'm going to turn into a low one.
Cyrus Schwert 00:49:08 Uh-oh.
Dungeon Master 00:49:17 one the rest of the party and we'll have to get to this in a second you see one of the images that's like in one of the cage spaces flickers out as he goes in and trading places with him is a large snake-like monster that hits in the room um you can tell it's like
Cletus Cobbington 00:49:36 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:49:37 magically put there. It's like technically it is a Naga, but you can tell it's part of the defense system. It's part of this trap. And I'll need you all to roll initiative to go into this fight. But elsewhere, we had which figure is going to look for a hat? Okay. You do have a slight...
Kaladen Shash 00:49:48 All day.
Leopold Magnus 00:49:54 It's a 2v1 on that.
Cyrus Schwert 00:49:55 Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:59 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:50:06 um obstacle in your way you don't know how long you've been here but as you were making your way to sort of the ledge the water is much farther down but you can tell that the larendell district is still submerged
Dungeon Master 00:50:19 But, like, you could swim. But, like, as you guys are walking out to there, because you're leaving the tower, I need the group average stealth checks. And then depending on those, we'll do the even versus odd check.
Zariel Torgan 00:50:39 Yeah, Cyrus.
Leopold Magnus 00:50:40 stuff.
Kaladen Shash 00:50:44 Sorry, I'm strong sleep. Move. Move.
Dungeon Master 00:50:49 Okay. Go ahead and give me one D20 roll. Alrighty. We will
Cyrus Schwert 00:50:54 Okay. I'm so nervous. Never split the party, they say.
Leopold Magnus 00:51:13 Damn.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:15 This is gonna be great. No!
Kaladen Shash 00:51:15 Y'all are going to see some action. They kind of have a healer with them.
Dungeon Master 00:51:19 Come back to this in a second. But the only thing that's going to happen is as you guys are walking out, you're going to catch just this faintest bit of something. It almost feels like
Cyrus Schwert 00:51:24 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:51:26 The dogs broke out.
Dungeon Master 00:51:37 as your ears go into tinnitus and you have the onset of the high pitch ringing, but like before you actually hear it, you can feel that you hear it. You guys get that sort of pressure in your ears and then you are going to wake up at a much later time as you guys are going to lose the rest of your day. Um, back to the tower, uh, unless something happens, like somebody comes and gets you or something like that, it'll change, but they don't know what's going on. Um,
Leopold Magnus 00:51:53 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:55 Hot damn. They'll probably walk right by us.
Cyrus Schwert 00:52:04 All I want is a fucking hat and a t-shirt. Oh my god. Yeah, you can move me.
Kaladen Shash 00:52:13 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:52:16 As you guys are in this room, what was the initiative count on that? Yeah, you do not. I'll find the token.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:21 So Jonathan, should I roll initiative? I'm like in stasis, aren't I? Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 00:52:53 What the hell is this thing? I suppose they're to roast the fucker.
Cletus Cobbington 00:52:56 Just a large guy.
Dungeon Master 00:52:56 There's that, there's that, and we'll spend it to game block so you can see it. Let's get his character sheet. He is a large monstrosity, not a huge monstrosity. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:52:57 Some sort of serpent? Is this a huge creature? OK.
Leopold Magnus 00:53:02 Oh, a little face.
Dungeon Master 00:53:27 Reset that. We have 19, 9. I'll delete that. Delete that. OK, Kaladin, you were up first.
Kaladen Shash 00:53:32 I think I'm going to cast I'll do a Nisoptric Blast and then I'll move in close so that I can take two attacks with
Kaladen Shash 00:54:02 Light Splitter, it's the Soft Trick Blast, 22. I'll move forward and take an attack with... Light Splitter, 23 to hit, and then second attack. Wow, 27 to hit.
Dungeon Master 00:54:05 Okay, go ahead and roll the hit on those as I set this up. Both hit.
Kaladen Shash 00:54:46 Good roll on the damage. Hot dog. That was maxes on every dice. That was ridiculous. Two swings. Yeah, that was the max roll. That was the perfect roll. 2d6s, 2d10s. And then the bonus. Whew.
Cletus Cobbington 00:54:49 She's.
Dungeon Master 00:54:50 46, damn. That's insane. Okay, FD hit.
Cyrus Schwert 00:54:51 Holy hell. That's a lot. Is it really? That's awesome. I've never seen that.
Zariel Torgan 00:55:03 That's fantastic. Wow.
Dungeon Master 00:55:15 Yeah, that's good. After that, it'll be this Guardian Naga's turn. It will bite and spit poison at you. So the first one is a 21 to hit.
Kaladen Shash 00:55:19 52 regular round Certainly I will shield
Dungeon Master 00:55:40 And then the spit will be 19, which misses. So both miss. And then that will be, who is next? Cletus.
Kaladen Shash 00:55:59 Let's go.
Cletus Cobbington 00:55:59 Right. I'm just going to... I'll cast Guide and Bolt at it. Try to heal with that. 22. 29.
Dungeon Master 00:56:17 28 hit. 29 damage. Jesus, guys. Okay. Starting to look pretty hurt.
Cletus Cobbington 00:56:29 Shoot a little energy almond at it.
Cyrus Schwert 00:56:30 I don't know.
Leopold Magnus 00:56:30 Come on up.
Dungeon Master 00:56:44 After that, back at the top calc, and you go again. OK. All right.
Kaladen Shash 00:56:48 I will use my action to cast Fireball. And I'll sculpt it for the one ally in the room. How dexterous is this large creature monstrosity? Yeah. It's OK. 16's a DC.
Dungeon Master 00:57:06 Honestly, pretty dexterous. With a six, it's a 14, so it fails. Sorry. Pretty much on death's door. Good hit. After that, it'll be its turn.
Kaladen Shash 00:57:21 No, pretty mid. That's it.
Dungeon Master 00:57:38 Can it do anything? It can cast spells, actually. It's going to use...
Kaladen Shash 00:57:55 through hypnosis. Wow.
Dungeon Master 00:57:58 No. You see, right? Because you guys are both right next to each other. Oh, you're up front. It'll do this to Cletus because he's not in range with him. You see, it calls down a column of fire on you. Give me a dexterity saving throw. As it casts a fifth level flame strike on you.
Cletus Cobbington 00:58:20 OK. Does the embered mane give me anything against fire? I'm resistant to fire. Wait, I have advantage on the save. If you're subjected to a spell that inflicts fire damage, you have advantage on the save. One more. Ooh.
Leopold Magnus 00:58:29 Wow. Ooh.
Dungeon Master 00:58:32 I think it makes you resistance to fire damage. So you will take half of the fire damage. Yes, you do. Good job reading that. I'm going to give that with advantage. 17. Its spell save DC is 16, so you will take half damage and quarter damage on the fire.
Kaladen Shash 00:58:50 Yeah, it's better. We're good.
Cletus Cobbington 00:58:50 Maybe? Let's go.
Cyrus Schwert 00:58:57 Let's go.
Dungeon Master 00:59:00 um it is 46 of each the first one will be the fire damage that is nine half to four half to two so you take two points of fire damage
Zariel Torgan 00:59:18 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:59:19 And you take half damage on the radiant damage. I rolled super soft. Another nine, half to four. That is an awful, awful roll. Okay. And that's it. After that, it is your turn. This thing's looking desperate and hurt.
Cletus Cobbington 00:59:28 Thanks for roasting some almonds. What is my name? I don't know that so much. Okay. I will
Cletus Cobbington 00:59:54 Got him bolted again, this time on the first level. I accidentally did a fourth level on the other one. 15 to beat it. Oh. Might as well try. Nope. Just hits a little bit better.
Dungeon Master 01:00:00 Yeah, that was a heavy hit. 15 hits, and you do have advantage because you're the first one to attack it with an actual attack. But 15 still hits, but maybe you crit. 16 still hits, though. It gets guided a little bit closer to center mass. 14 points of damage. It is so hurt.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:03 We should have advantage now, right?
Kaladen Shash 01:00:03 That makes sense.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:11 Oh, damn.
Cletus Cobbington 01:00:29 No.
Dungeon Master 01:00:30 But it is not dead yet. Aphrodite is cowed in. You don't need to roll the rest because it has two hit points left. So no matter what, you end it to start with.
Kaladen Shash 01:00:35 Yes, I see how hard it is, and I take two large swings. The first one hits 18, 19, so 19 points.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:41 advantage.
Dungeon Master 01:00:55 And then you'll see that since this is the end of that round, Leopold, you actually pop out once he kind of cuts this thing down. But Kaladin, how do you finish it? Biceps right below the head level.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:04 Just slice right through light splitters, like getting like hot and all the glass kind of like comes a little bit more because none of it's really touching. And it just right through the snake, just right in half.
Dungeon Master 01:01:20 It kind of falls off on the floor and the body thuds the other way going limp. And it's at that point that you see Leopold is ejected from the glass cage right back to where he's standing. And you see now that you didn't see before, there is a almost completely invisible trap door.
Cletus Cobbington 01:01:24 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:01:39 um pressure plate on the floor as you get within a certain range in the room um can't see it so once you just got close to the glass cages it automatically switches you and teleports out the monster randomly
Leopold Magnus 01:01:52 Holy smokes. What did I miss? Where did this guy come from? Oh dear. Well, thank goodness I have my pals. You really chopped them up.
Cletus Cobbington 01:02:00 You went in and he came out, buddy. Now it's dead and you're alive.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:00 You got sucked into his. Yes. He was no challenge.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:07 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:02:17 Okay. So you guys are out of combat. Everything is good to go. You see that like once Leopold is shunted out, the back of the glass case that he's in sort of dissolves and you have a way through to the other side of the room to the staircase. You could take a look at the other sort of holograms if you want. There is the broken one on the side that looks empty. And as a reminder, your friends only just left.
Cyrus Schwert 01:02:17 What?
Kaladen Shash 01:02:46 Yeah, can I look at the one just to make sure it is empty? Is that out of the corridor that's already been triggered or does it look like it's safe to approach that one?
Dungeon Master 01:02:58 Yeah, you see you walk up, and the cage itself is empty, but you see as you get really close, all of the little cages, very faintly and almost invisible, like you'd have to know it's there to know, do have little indicators for what's in it. And this one that's broken and empty does say, Project Armored Immortality. And it looks like something was broken in and taken out.
Kaladen Shash 01:03:23 That sounds like a problem. I point out the labels to everybody else in the group that's still here. Let us go upstairs, last floor. Right, you said there's three floors, John? Roseth.
Dungeon Master 01:03:42 you're on the third floor. So this would just be next level. I'll say to throw it a little bit of a bone so that they can play. It's about at this time that through your mental telepathic bond that you have, you guys...
Dungeon Master 01:03:58 get that sort of ringing sensation that's almost like if you put on headphones that are on the wrong radio channel, just like high-pitched screams sort of forces you to shake that connection close on your head. And you can tell that the other two people just experienced something like horrifying, like that sound was insane. But something about being a far enough away distance or indoors or something has made it so that you weren't affected.
Kaladen Shash 01:04:28 Yeah, we would sense that they sort of passed out or aren't communicating on the link. Did you find your head store? What was that noise? Is it still ringing?
Dungeon Master 01:04:32 You could tell from their end of the connection that they experienced that sound. And if you tried to reach out, they would be unresponsive.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:39 To the
Cletus Cobbington 01:04:46 Oh boy, no.
Cyrus Schwert 01:04:53 I mean, I feel like I can't answer, right? I'm definitely in a coma. My away message on AOL Instant Messenger plays.
Kaladen Shash 01:04:58 Oh, we should let this go outside. Something's happened. Yeah, well, that's the whole point. He's silent. That's the no response.
Zariel Torgan 01:05:07 You should hear the Skype loading the boom, boom, boom. Boom, boom, boom.
Cletus Cobbington 01:05:19 Alright. Didn't even listen to you, my bad. Yeah, this thing just seems to be hella booby-trapped. Probably should go healed.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:24 That's great. Well, I'm not getting much from them. Should we go take a look, see if they're doing all right?
Cyrus Schwert 01:05:26 That's for the old heads in the room. That's not for Trace.
Dungeon Master 01:05:35 He's not here right now. As you guys leave the tower, what you're going to first see is that
Kaladen Shash 01:05:42 Yes, let us go. Don't think there's much to grab.
Dungeon Master 01:05:58 You're going to see them sort of standing perfectly still on the center of the path sort of towards the ledge, like limp, like zombie level of like muscle relaxation, just standing there. And go ahead and both anybody who's present and moving and give me a perception check.
Kaladen Shash 01:06:18 There we go.
Cletus Cobbington 01:06:21 Oh, so close to 25.
Zariel Torgan 01:06:21 said.
Dungeon Master 01:06:28 19 is pretty good. OK. Very good. Leopold, as you guys exit this tower, you don't see anything itself.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:36 Yeah, I'll make a perception check. Oh, nice.
Dungeon Master 01:06:52 But you do see like like you just miss something like you see the bamboo and the foliage like finishes rustling as something disappears out of view. No footsteps, no noise, just like something disappearing in your companions like 50 feet down the road.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:19 I was just going to point out that you guys should take a look at the picture I put in the chat. But anyways, I'll pass that along to the group. What I spotted.
Kaladen Shash 01:07:23 I did. I was dying.
Cyrus Schwert 01:07:24 Yeah, I wouldn't call it amazing. This is blasphemy.
Dungeon Master 01:07:31 It's so perfect. How much did you type? It's going to see you in D&D court.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:32 That's pretty amazing. I mean, that's pretty. That's pretty fantastic.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:52 probably about like four or five lines of text not much yeah yeah and then I said this is the character I want a four panel scene sleeping on a spidery pillow
Cyrus Schwert 01:07:54 I'll see you in court. 100%.
Dungeon Master 01:08:04 Goddamn. This is getting saved forever. It's...
Kaladen Shash 01:08:05 It's just so good that you fed him the other image from the chat. Like, hey, this is the character. Fantastic, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:06 What image generator? Oh. That's awesome. Oh, that's great.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:20 And then I wanted to say condensed and refined moist spider silk in the last one.
Cyrus Schwert 01:08:28 it's like when crayons fuck the frog this is going to stay with me
Dungeon Master 01:08:33 What are you guys doing? Do you see this? You can relay it. How do you want to approach this?
Zariel Torgan 01:08:37 Hello, man. Hello, man.
Cletus Cobbington 01:08:46 It's over bro.
Kaladen Shash 01:09:01 Do we feel like there's any imminent danger if we step out there? We can just see him down the road? So I'm kind of looking straight at him again, and I'm like, Zariel, what are you two doing? Don't know. Answer on the comms.
Dungeon Master 01:09:08 Yeah, they are unmoving, standing. It looks like they're looking out over the city, but not moving at all. Nope.
Kaladen Shash 01:09:35 OK, should we go out there and look at them? Should we check on them? Why are they just standing there? Yeah, can I head towards them?
Cletus Cobbington 01:09:48 Yeah, we might wanna help.
Dungeon Master 01:09:52 Yeah. As you walk up to them, doesn't seem to be like they seem to be some sort of effect, obviously being unresponsive, but like they're injured.
Dungeon Master 01:10:05 Their eyes are just kind of like they're like lenses and irises and pupils are like just kind of super dilated, like they're not focusing on anything specifically. But as you walk up and you sort of shake their shoulder after a second, you see that they kind of come to not realizing that they've sort of lost as much time. Same sort of confusion is found to be that happened to you all before.
Cyrus Schwert 01:10:35 I was having a crazy dream. It was about a Cheez-It. Yeah. All I wanted was one. Holy...
Zariel Torgan 01:10:36 Pretty weird. Just singular.
Cletus Cobbington 01:10:36 Interesting. What hats did you find? About a cheezer.
Kaladen Shash 01:10:45 okay okay
Dungeon Master 01:10:48 Jesus. He's got it on like an airplane travel pillow, like it's just around his neck. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:54 You are getting good use out of that pillow, Cyrus. That's great.
Cyrus Schwert 01:11:02 Once we go in the fucking tree again, I'll be able to get my real pillow. I left it in there.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:13 Oh, shit. Yeah. Before...
Kaladen Shash 01:11:14 A pearl of sorts? A string of
Dungeon Master 01:11:18 Down a cliff in the water.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:24 What do you suppose you're doing down there anyways? Weren't you looking for hats? Hats Sebastianery is just down the way. Oh. Well, it has been some time, but I thought it was a bit closer. Sorry.
Cyrus Schwert 01:11:32 I feel like it's way more than just down the way. I feel like you were fibbing a little about how far it would be. It's okay. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. It's okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:11:33 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:11:48 You've never been here. What are you talking about?
Kaladen Shash 01:11:52 He's got a map. Oh, he's still on that. He just woke up. He's like, let's go. Where's the hats? You guys are just standing there like,
Zariel Torgan 01:11:57 They'll be just going to dive in, swim to get a hat. I mean, you want to jump? Yeah, for me, no time has passed. Yeah, I mean, as far as we know, we turned around and you guys just followed us because you also really want hats.
Cyrus Schwert 01:12:08 We got out here and then went into a coma. Do you still want to hear it? I know this is a theme.
Kaladen Shash 01:12:22 like zombies like doing nothing just like frozen let me tell you it's been like oh it's been like 15 minutes okay you guys are just standing there doing nothing yeah a little less for you though yeah is it
Cletus Cobbington 01:12:24 You.
Dungeon Master 01:12:24 I mean, yeah, that's true. There hasn't been a lot of passage of time, so to them it is the same moment, and you guys are just behind them now. There's only three rounds of combat, so that's pretty much everything.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:34 Because they're sneaky. Oh, shit. We need to like... Yeah. Yeah, you guys kicked ass on that. That was pretty impressive.
Leopold Magnus 01:12:41 hasn't it been only just a few minutes for me too because I was stuck in stasis okay yeah so that would only been 10 or 15 seconds yeah yeah damn you guys killed that thing fast yeah
Kaladen Shash 01:12:53 Yeah. 18 seconds. You were out. You're like, what happened? Sucker punched him. There'll be no hat.
Dungeon Master 01:13:01 10 rounds of combat is to one minute.
Cletus Cobbington 01:13:04 Well, you're already used to it. What's the big deal then? Even it out. Get a wet hat.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:06 Yeah. Gnarly. Well, do we need to like... A quality... A quality hat.
Cyrus Schwert 01:13:10 I just feel like the hats are gonna be wet. Just like the almonds, just like the pillow, just like everything that we've encountered in this friggin' event. I feel like it's just gonna be wet. Yeah, my head is wet, not only on one side. It's not, like, dripping. My hands are still pruney from when we were underwater for, like, a while. I want less water.
Kaladen Shash 01:13:25 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:13:32 you guys reckon if you waited a whole nother day you could probably the water would be like down enough that it'd only be in the lowest two districts
Cletus Cobbington 01:13:33 Get like a suede fedora. It'll soak up a lot of water. And then it'll keep everything wet. I just don't understand that. I'll start fishing. We'll just wait.
Cyrus Schwert 01:13:42 I don't want more. Guys, we only need to wait 24 more. No. No.
Leopold Magnus 01:14:00 Well, if we're waiting around, should we go investigate some of that other stuff? OK, we saw the light. There was only two wings that were armed. You said there's more levels in the tower?
Kaladen Shash 01:14:05 I think the circle is the only other thing we've got to investigate and avoid. There's more levels in the tower. There's cash and prizes in there. There's cash and prizes in there.
Cletus Cobbington 01:14:09 Let's go find them.
Dungeon Master 01:14:10 There was still, there was more tower. There's more buildings. If you want, there is the teleportation area. You haven't checked that out yet. Yeah. You didn't make it to the top. You just, you, you drew back right away because of the sound. Cause I wanted everybody to be able to be there.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:31 Well, do you guys want to... I guess we'll do the hat tomorrow. We'll all head back in. It's upsetting. Well, give me a good one. Alright. I don't... I'm self-conscious about it. I mean...
Leopold Magnus 01:14:33 We could go on. Yeah, check it out.
Kaladen Shash 01:14:37 Yes. Let the water go down. Be patient. You'll find a beautiful hat. Focus on the mission. Sariel, I never knew you liked hats so much. You never said anything.
Cletus Cobbington 01:14:48 Slightly less. It's not weird.
Cyrus Schwert 01:14:55 I mean, this bear has a hat. I don't know where that hat comes from. Ugh. The bear is a robot? Got it. I feel like I've missed that. You're like Five Nights at Freddy's. Got it.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:00 It's part of my body. I'm a robot. It's not weird. Yeah. Yeah, those aren't natural colors.
Kaladen Shash 01:15:09 All of his polymorphs are like animatronic versions of the animal. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:22 That's great.
Dungeon Master 01:15:23 That's what he turns other people to. You guys get back into the tower, you go up the three levels, and then as you advance to the fourth level, as it loads up, you see there is a
Cletus Cobbington 01:15:24 We're always so distracted by it being neon pink and green. It distracts from the actual metal aspect.
Cyrus Schwert 01:15:28 Yeah, exactly. It really does.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:32 Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:15:52 large cut tree stump on the ground so you walk into this almost completely empty room there's like a bedroll on the corner sort of by the side and this tree that is like rooted into the ground cut at the stump so it's dead and stays like that almost looks more like it's been turned into a table decoratively um little name plaque on the trees you walk up that says um
Dungeon Master 01:16:21 Lord Marshal Zarvin Vixwraith. Yeah, you know the Lord Marshal is one of the positions. Same as the Lord Marshal in New New Harbor. Yeah. Yeah, the head of what would have been Moonhaven's military.
Kaladen Shash 01:16:28 Was he a council member as well? Same as our Lord Mission. That's great. Yep.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:33 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:16:38 Sorry.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:40 So head of the legionnaires then, right? They're analog? Yep. Is there... Okay, so we're just at a tree stump, you said, and there was a bedroll?
Dungeon Master 01:16:52 Let me get you the spelling for the other one.
Kaladen Shash 01:17:02 Nothing else in the room.
Dungeon Master 01:17:02 Yeah, it's like a very basic room. Now there is some more stuff on the tree stump, but that's what you had seen so far. So as you look onto the tree stump, again, you know that there is going to be sort of the trap in the room. And so as you're looking it in, you see that there is a sort of short lectern sitting on the center of the stump and on it is a, a,
Zariel Torgan 01:17:04 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:17:27 Black grimoire bound in sort of some sort of dragon hide. It's like scaly, but finally works definitely just like a book. And you see that there is a glowing orange sort of like copper orange sigil that smells faintly of ozone and rich metal.
Zariel Torgan 01:17:39 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:17:53 She said, what metal? Wrench?
Cyrus Schwert 01:17:54 Smells like ozone. Smells like penis. Sorry. Didn't mean to answer this.
Leopold Magnus 01:17:56 Rich metal like gold. Any Yeah. Where is that that sigil? It's right on the stump as well.
Dungeon Master 01:17:57 Smells like ozone. And like, well, I think it's kind of like it is a heavy metallic scent. You wouldn't tell what kind of metals. Like, I guess unless it's iron, they don't have a distinct smell. Smells very metallic. Penny's is very good. It's directly below the book.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:26 below the book. On the stump.
Dungeon Master 01:18:30 Yep, there's the stump, a small lectern, a rune, the book. And that was the other guy's name. Would you like to cast something?
Cyrus Schwert 01:18:36 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:18:41 And we can't detect anything else, like as far as invisible force plates or... I only... I'm looking at my spells right now. Could identify, not. Where's my detector?
Zariel Torgan 01:18:41 Let's see what I got.
Kaladen Shash 01:19:10 Yeah, I just have identified. Could I do that to the book as it's an object? Yeah. Yes, I'll do this. I will begin this process.
Dungeon Master 01:19:16 You could absolutely identify. In fact, identify was the spell you would need because you would have found that the spell magic or detect magic, I mean, wouldn't have been powerful enough. So if you cast identify, you can even ritual cast it if you want. It'll reveal the nature of it. OK.
Cletus Cobbington 01:19:18 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:19:41 you are in the process of casting identify, everybody's sort of chilling out. As your identify spell sparks and goes off, the runes that you drew around it on the table flare, and you understand the arcane process enchanted into this. If you were to interact with the book
Dungeon Master 01:20:01 without disabling the runes somehow, you would be drained magically. Like mechanically speaking, touching the book would have you resulting in losing some sort of spell slots. If you wanted to disrupt the runes, it'll be a sleight of hand check or you could cast a spell magic.
Kaladen Shash 01:20:13 Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, can I disrupt the runes by cutting them, erasing them, hitting them with a firebolt? Yeah, I don't have the spell magic active, so I will do a sleight of hand check. You can do a spell. I will explain the situation.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:17 I could help him out with that.
Dungeon Master 01:20:30 Those would be the two options.
Cletus Cobbington 01:20:35 I could do the spell magic. Pass spell magic.
Kaladen Shash 01:20:44 We must get rid of the runes first. Who can do this?
Dungeon Master 01:20:52 you see the rune sort of sputters flares and then distinguishes extinguishes sorry it's very distinguished when it does it but then the book sort of dissolves away and the whole lectern kind of disappears and you see that the illusion it was hiding shows you that in fact on this table are
Dungeon Master 01:21:13 A bunch of different papers. And as you go through it, I'll kind of tell you what you find. But we're going to take a quick pause as Hannah just got home. So I'm going to say hi and I'll smoke again. So we'll take our quick little breather and let you guys know you have made it halfway through the tower. This is level four of nine. So you'll be hitting five next. Yeah, I can like five to ten.
Cletus Cobbington 01:21:28 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:34 Nice. Sweet.
Kaladen Shash 01:21:35 Excellent. We're going to get something good, and we really need some fucking cash. I can't do a lot with adding more spell books or finishing the enchantment stuff until we have some money. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:21:36 Cool. Gotta find some magic items in here. I feel like we haven't gotten one of those in a while. Yeah. Yeah. We're so broke, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:22:00 man. Travis, my rotator cuff was so tight after like three days of disc golf and like playing like two courses a day. Oh my gosh. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:22:08 Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah, when I did my long haul playing, it's just like my feet just from walking. I was like, ugh. A couple of weeks ago,
Leopold Magnus 01:22:08 Damn. Yeah, well, how many rounds did you play? Nice. Oh, yeah, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:22:27 uh friday night i played i played eight yeah i played 18 on friday and then saturday we played lost again i know that was sunday no that was saturday sunday holy high was we did horse butte one more time so and we played skyliner before that like one and a half times so solid solid solid golfing weekend
Leopold Magnus 01:22:44 Nice. Holy crap. That's, that's good, man. I, uh, yeah, that's too bad. I was out of town. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. I can be totally flexible.
Cyrus Schwert 01:22:44 And we played Skyline. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
Kaladen Shash 01:22:58 It's all right, man. Every weekend seems to be all right for a day. Hey, you should maybe next Wednesday. What time do you get off work? Are you pretty flexible with your hours? Because you should come by the clinic and we can set you up with some exercises. We just figure out some bands for you.
Leopold Magnus 01:23:18 Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That would be excellent. I was trying to do, eh, I guess I need to be more consistent, but I was doing some, some random ones I found online. So I'm sure what you set me up will be much, much better. And, uh, yeah, you know, I was, you know, I was like, try to do some random stuff, but it doesn't help because you know, I don't, I don't, not a professional. So yeah, no, absolutely. I'd be totally down for that.
Kaladen Shash 01:23:34 That's good. Yeah, we'll make it happen. It's OK. Just some good guidance will help you out. Yeah, that's good. Cool.
Cletus Cobbington 01:23:40 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:23:55 Yeah, geez, man, these images are getting good. Yeah. Yeah, dude, I...
Kaladen Shash 01:23:59 That four panel, I was giggling, man. I never even thought to give it more of a caricature, like a time-lapse approach to the picture. That's great. I always think one frame. Now...
Cyrus Schwert 01:24:01 yeah that's pretty wild yeah yeah
Leopold Magnus 01:24:14 One frame. No, yeah, you can do a lot. And I haven't used the chat GPT image gym much. That was where that one came from. But they really nailed character consistency. Because I just fed it that one that you shared, Travis. And the jeans are even ripped. The spider tattoos are perfect. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:24:30 No chat was that's really good. You'll just hit your daily limit so fast on like, like prompts for like image generation. I think it's like only like four or five of them. It's like really small. Yeah. That free one is great. Oh, okay. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:24:34 That's it.
Leopold Magnus 01:24:44 That's such a bummer. I'm hoping that Google catches up a little bit because they're generous with their stuff. You can use a ton for free. No, it's some cool shit, man. If you don't use more of the AI stuff, you should look into it. You can almost completely write
Cyrus Schwert 01:25:10 I use it for work. Yeah. I bet. Yeah, that's so crazy.
Leopold Magnus 01:25:12 Yeah, use it for work all the time. Writing code. Yeah. You could generate any kind of small script program you want these days. You just have to be able to describe what you want. It's not software engineering, but if you want to make a couple one-off things here and there, or even small tools to really help things, you could do it.
Kaladen Shash 01:25:28 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:25:44 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:25:57 So what do we feel like our goal is? Are we trying to sneak back over to Moonhaven or Nunu Arbor? Yeah, well, it's in the next day or two. We're going to poke around the castle and then
Leopold Magnus 01:26:03 Yeah, like long term? Yeah. Yeah. That was what I thought, was that maybe we try to position that rune so we can pop in. Maybe, how far was it from the chamber where the dragon was protecting the Wellspring? Somewhere like that. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:26:23 So I was going to say, if we try to teleport to somewhere we know, something that we're familiar with, so that chamber where we saw the wellspring would be easy to hit, or hopefully hit. That was the tunnels that we entered to keep moving further. That's when we fought the Reverend. Remember that had consumed enough esoteric power
Leopold Magnus 01:26:35 Yeah. Or wasn't there even further along, there was like an anti-chamber of an old church? Was that the same dungeon? Yeah. Yep. Right, that's right. We follow the reverend down there. That's how we got out of the city initially when we were looking down there. Yeah. So, you know, we could pop in pretty dang close to somewhere where that graveyard comes out. Like,
Kaladen Shash 01:26:55 Yeah, it could be good to see the wellspring. I don't think it was more than like a day or several hours
Leopold Magnus 01:27:04 and just sneak out undetected. Yeah, or I mean, honestly, if it's a short travel, we just travel that wellspring, then maybe there's something, yeah. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:27:23 tunnel back up to something Jonathan what's that distance can you remind us oh whenever how far how far through the tunnels like how long would we travel through the tunnels to go from where we entered in the cemetery um to get to the wellspring like how long was that travel for us
Dungeon Master 01:27:28 I think you guys long rifted twice in there. So it was three total days. But the first day was like you started in the middle of the night. So...
Leopold Magnus 01:27:41 Moving fast. Yeah, we were fighting the whole time, weren't we?
Dungeon Master 01:27:57 Two and some change, but you guys long rested because you were really hurt. So it's hard to tell, like you never really went through it like speed pace. Yeah. Fighting or you were being really cautious.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:16 Yeah. So no, I think that would be the good spot to land. But I mean, I guess if you guys had other things in mind too, if we're moving the circle, we can move it wherever we want. Yeah. So, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:28:28 No, I think that hit checks the box for a retrace for steps and a quiet entry into the city. Yes, we're back.
Dungeon Master 01:28:38 We all back? Mike, okay. You are in sort of the head general's personal room. He sleeps on a bedroll, very militaristic, and there's nothing personal effects-wise in the room other than this planning table, which you discover is sort of like a war table. You read there are a lot of reports and different correspondences between him and other people
Cyrus Schwert 01:28:42 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:29:05 Um, about just like the general timeline of what happened to the city. There was the cursed army after. Which is the West dome fell. It started sieging the outside of moon Haven. And it went on for months and months. And.
Dungeon Master 01:29:24 um but like once the dome broke and the city fell it was like moon haven was killed in like a day it was fast once it happened um the letters talk about like you find ones like almost seem like last moments kind of deal um where the inhabitants of moon haven were being mass being um teleported like similar to what was going to happen when your guys's city would happen but like a
Zariel Torgan 01:29:25 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:29:53 new new arbor those are the refugees that kind of escaped and teleported out towards the east dome as well um and then the last sort of correspondence um reports that once the cursed king had entered the the city like everything was over people were dying so fast but it said he was accompanied by huge monstrous creatures um described as being a large phoenix-like bird
Cletus Cobbington 01:30:10 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:30:23 a horrendous arachnoid arachnid monster uh an enormous mutated lupine monster and a large bull type beast of purple and black flame with smoke and so it's like these reports of these creatures that came in after him and then there's nothing else but you kind of get this
Dungeon Master 01:30:48 awful picture that like the last thing the city was doing was uh getting all the civilians out and they were just kind of like everybody was dying in the process and then that kind of tracks with history because you know that some people were infected um with the esopter curse before um
Cletus Cobbington 01:30:54 you
Dungeon Master 01:31:08 They had evacuated Moonhaven. That's how it kind of persisted. There are, as you guys thought about, a weirdly large number of people who have it right now. It seems like there's way too much of the population with it. But you guys all have special abilities because you have the curse. So it's like people got infected and then got away. And that's how it's still on the bloodline. And then that's like all you see in this room. It's like all this guy cared about was...
Dungeon Master 01:31:37 the war on his last days and then you guys keep moving on and as you hit the fifth floor this one has a much different look there is a door at the top of the stairs as you walk in yeah go ahead
Kaladen Shash 01:31:44 you
Leopold Magnus 01:31:52 John. Oh, I was just going to ask before we left that room, was there any correspondence between any of the other domes, like messages sent past between Nunu Arbor and Moonhaven? Because it seems like a pretty chaotic thing, but they might reach out about what was happening.
Dungeon Master 01:32:11 You see general letters, like nothing specific. That's a great question. So you'll get something as you guys keep progressing because I know your character is looking for it. You see that like there were plans set up
Cyrus Schwert 01:32:15 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:32:25 but they're just like general letters. So yeah, there is correspondence documented that, and it's well known that New New Arbor was the dome that helped out Moonhaven and everything kind of stopped there because the East Dome also fell, but that's because nobody could help them. So it was like New New Arbor picked Moonhaven, everything ended there, but the top three domes are sort of gone. That's why.
Leopold Magnus 01:32:38 Got it.
Dungeon Master 01:32:53 So you do see that like, yeah, they were working together. But like I said, because you asked that question, Leopold's going to find something later too.
Zariel Torgan 01:32:53 you you
Dungeon Master 01:33:05 But that's it. So as you guys make it to the next room, there's the door at the top of the stairs. And on the door, it says, like, all in glittered sort of jewels kind of, like, embedded into the door. It says, Lord Master of Currency, Anareth Illiren. I-L-I-R-E-N. And as you open the door, it is a...
Dungeon Master 01:33:33 room that is very elegant florida ceiling mirrors line in a winding hall um and you see um that it even kind of goes in front of you so the whole room is is mirror essentially but you guys haven't actually entered the space yet
Zariel Torgan 01:33:35 Excuse me.
Kaladen Shash 01:33:57 Do you see anything other than these mirrors and reflections? Do we see like furniture or shelving or is this just a corridor we can't see around because it's just mirrors?
Dungeon Master 01:34:05 Well, yeah. And you asked about the reflections, which is very key. As you're sort of looking for differences, looking for furniture, looking for defining features in the room, you notice first, because you're looking for it, the back mirror seems to be a doorway.
Zariel Torgan 01:34:07 you you
Dungeon Master 01:34:23 But it's like the door is a mirror itself, but you catch the lining of the frame. And the next thing you notice is that the reflections all seem to be that you can see. So everywhere you look, you see yourselves, right? It's all pointed at you, but that they're all directly pointed at you. Nothing is reflecting something else in that room. Like no matter what, when you walk in there, I'm going to be the center.
Kaladen Shash 01:34:51 strange somebody's very vain whoever on this office anyone have guessed what's wrong with this place do you feel anything strange like can i
Kaladen Shash 01:35:16 There's nothing, I don't have an object to try to identify. I'm not close enough to anything, but like, do we sense any other? What rides? What are you talking about?
Dungeon Master 01:35:21 Anybody who wants to can give me an Arcana check. 18, 19, there it is. You guys see...
Leopold Magnus 01:35:26 I'll do one. And I'll turn to Kaladin. And I'll say, oh, this does remind me of one of those rides that would come to town. Funhaus.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:39 you you
Dungeon Master 01:35:46 just beyond the mirror surface on every mirror, there is a, um, like ancient sigil inscribed into it. Um, and you get the sense that, um, as soon as you enter the space, they're going to go off. Like it is primed for like you to enter in, but that's all you get on just another comment check.
Zariel Torgan 01:36:12 We should throw a rock. Chip.
Kaladen Shash 01:36:19 Can I grab the bedroll from downstairs real quick and then throw it into the room and see what happens? The bedroll from the general's office. The one...
Dungeon Master 01:36:26 What do you throw in? Yeah. How do I want this to manifest? That's really funny. I don't think it's supposed to work like this, but you throw the bedroll in there, and you see that as it enters into the space, three bedrolls kind of come out of different mirrors. And bedrolls aren't technically sentient, but they...
Dungeon Master 01:36:54 automatically go towards the regular bedroll and they like hit in for like like bedrolls are like spinning around each other like they're like forced to and then the three mirror ones shatter and disappear and what you would have guessed was like three rounds
Zariel Torgan 01:36:58 Start shaking it.
Kaladen Shash 01:37:21 Okay. Leopold wants to try stepping in there. Leopold's our tank. He's got, what is this, AC? Isn't it something ridiculous?
Zariel Torgan 01:37:35 Yeah, I'll go in there.
Cletus Cobbington 01:37:40 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:37:47 Oh, um, you want me to go in there? Uh, oh, okay. And I'll take one very tentative footstep, kind of try to put my foot down as slowly as possible.
Kaladen Shash 01:38:03 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:38:05 Okay. As you step into this space, let me put you guys on the right floor. Even though it doesn't actually look like it. You see, this is 1D4 minus one. That is minimum of one. So one single mirror version of yourself popped out. And I need you to roll initiative as you face off against yourself.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:27 No.
Cletus Cobbington 01:38:36 Just like the blood. Do the robot, see if it dances back. I think we did that last time.
Leopold Magnus 01:38:37 Okay. Yeah, just like the blood. Well... We might have to find out.
Kaladen Shash 01:38:51 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:38:59 Okay, 11. And then roll initiative again for the mirror version of you. This is going to be you fighting yourself. The duplicate you has AC of 14 and half of your hit points. It goes and attacks you with everything it can for three rounds before shattering. So you go first.
Leopold Magnus 01:39:09 Okay. Okay. Well, it rolled an eight. AC 14. Got it. I will try to shift my weight back onto my left foot. See what it does.
Cletus Cobbington 01:39:10 Bye.
Cyrus Schwert 01:39:14 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:39:41 doesn't do the same thing. You get the sense that it's going to attack you. It's very hostile. It's coming at you. Nice. Go ahead and roll.
Leopold Magnus 01:39:48 Oh! Oh! Calm down there! Calm down there! And I'll unsheath my lightsaber very slowly. Everything's gonna be okay! And then I'm just gonna start hacking. And I'm gonna take a big swing. Oh yeah. That connects. 29 on the first strike. And then...
Kaladen Shash 01:40:04 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:40:19 You said AC 14? Nice. Two connections. First slice does 12 damage. Second slice does 9 damage.
Dungeon Master 01:40:22 Yeah, so definitely hits. He has 41 HP. 21 and a 20.
Leopold Magnus 01:40:43 So with that, you just kind of see Leopold lunge forward and start slicing. I think I maybe lop a corner of my shoulder off, like a little shoulder pad, with that bit of damage. Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:40:56 breaks off this glass you see as soon as you cut it it just turns into like a rough jagged glass shape of what it was before falling to the ground and shattering after your go i need you to attack yourself so roll your you're not going to do the elemental damage but roll an attack against yourself if you hit you're just doing your searing saber like slashing damage
Cletus Cobbington 01:41:03 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:41:14 Yeah. OK. But before I end my turn, I'll pull up the bonus action, and I'll do some stones. All right. And then same for myself. I'm rolling to hit AC 23. OK. With the same attack.
Dungeon Master 01:41:28 Perfect. Your normal AC. Meh. Can you hit yourself? Meh.
Leopold Magnus 01:41:43 Miss on one. Miss on two. Oh, dear. Sir, I think you better stand down there. And I'm kind of like hesitant with my saber. Does it look pretty aggressive still turning back towards me?
Dungeon Master 01:41:50 With Swift, that's round one. Up next is you. It has 20 HP. Last round you did 21, so there's a chance that you kill it. Yeah. You get this one. This is a very big trap.
Kaladen Shash 01:42:12 Yeah, still coming hard.
Leopold Magnus 01:42:12 Okay, well, and then I just run forward and attempt to spear it dead on. Just run my saber clear through its chest piece. And I will... 23, that one hits. 27, that one hits. Oh, okay.
Dungeon Master 01:42:29 23 hits. 27 hits. 16. 18. Nice. 24. You shatter.
Leopold Magnus 01:42:39 So that's 16, and then I get these two D6s. Oh, nice. So another eight points. 24, so that's enough, huh?
Dungeon Master 01:42:53 Yeah, one final pierce right through its torso, and it just turns to glass and explodes in the room. And you see, when you do that, that the runes fade out, and the space kind of loses the magical energy. Yep. Mirrors are still there, but all the runes are stable.
Leopold Magnus 01:43:12 Cool. Wait, so I was in like a hall of mirrors, right? All the mirrors are still there. I'll say, guys, I got them. And I'm going to take off at a full sprint, kind of like, yeah. And then just run clean into one of these mirrors thinking that I'm running towards the group and I'm just like really turned around and just clothesline myself. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:43:33 well it's just like little kids in glass houses yeah says it
Dungeon Master 01:43:36 It's funny that you say that. Give me a pure luck check. Just a d20 roll. 20. Leopold crashes into the hidden
Leopold Magnus 01:43:44 Okay, what would that be, like a D20? All right, D20, let's see. Oh, a natural 20. That's perfect.
Cletus Cobbington 01:43:53 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:58 Nice. Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:44:05 mirror room broken into a dark space where you crash into this old wooden box chest and your weight sort of crushes it and you hear this i heard you guys talking about this before um this chinking and chinkling sound of coins as they sort of spill onto the ground
Kaladen Shash 01:44:05 Yes. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:44:27 uh you've like broke it into this treasure chest containing a large sum of both gold and platinum bars you find
Leopold Magnus 01:44:36 nice i kind of turn around and i come come back out and i peek around the mirror so oh um gents and i kind of point and all these coins start falling out of my like cracks and crevices they're just kind of like jangling around ding ding ding ding ding ding i'm basically a walking jackpot right now
Zariel Torgan 01:44:36 Ooh.
Kaladen Shash 01:44:38 I like that answer. Platinum bars. Hundies.
Dungeon Master 01:44:58 all of the chain, and then whoever's keeping track, I think that's Jesse, you get 2,000 gold pieces and 50 platinum bars. At 10, it's always a 10 to 10 conversion. So 10 silvers is one gold, 10 gold is one platinum.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:07 Jesus. How many platinum is a platinum bar worth? Oh, yeah, yeah, I know, but you said there were 50 bars of platinum, or is it just 50 platinum worth of bars of platinum? Gotcha. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:45:11 Ah.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:11 Oh yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:45:12 one rich ass chest.
Dungeon Master 01:45:30 yeah 50 platinum is what it is
Zariel Torgan 01:45:40 You're up to a total in gold value, 4,600. So everybody knows. Sweet.
Kaladen Shash 01:45:52 That's great. I think I just need money to finish the Ring of Spellholding or Enchantment just for shield. The time's been invested. It's just money. A certain amount of money for crafting materials. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:59 Hell yeah. You finished that one, didn't you, Kaladin? Got it. Nice. You'll be able to finish it. Hell yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:46:05 Just needs the fun. No way. 14
Cletus Cobbington 01:46:17 You know what's sad is the mirror version of me would have had more AC than me. I'm still wearing measly leather. No one, we haven't fought anything that would possibly have armor on it or around. Everything is just like magical creatures. No.
Kaladen Shash 01:46:24 What? What? What can you wear?
Dungeon Master 01:46:37 Wait, okay. Doesn't the cloak give you a bonus to your AC too? Really? Hold on. Oh, okay. We'll work on that. You and I will talk. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:46:46 i don't think so well i haven't equipped and didn't do it now it doesn't have anything to do with ac but that's that's why i took cleric though so i could wear up to heavy armor eventually i will find good artwork
Leopold Magnus 01:46:56 Damn.
Zariel Torgan 01:47:01 That's wild. Hey, your mirror comes out. It's like, dude, I'm tougher than you. I'm made of glass.
Kaladen Shash 01:47:06 Oh, it's red. Get the man some armor. Just calling you out. Just calling you out. I only have the one medium set I've always had.
Dungeon Master 01:47:07 13 is crazy. I mean, does anybody else have something to get up this armor? Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:47:14 That's why I get hit by everything. Less HP, but...
Leopold Magnus 01:47:32 Uh, Hmm.
Zariel Torgan 01:47:37 I have the upgraded medium and the original leather is the only other one I have. I have a backup shield. You want my old shield? It'll give you a plus two.
Kaladen Shash 01:47:37 This is the first set I ever got from Hamhawk, and then she updated it.
Cletus Cobbington 01:47:48 I think staffs are two-handed, though. Oh, well, then I would be. Can I still cast spells, though, like with Staff Enhanced? No.
Dungeon Master 01:47:52 No, you can wield as one, as a d6 instead of a d8 or whatever. As a cleric, I think you have to be a war cleric to just get that. Otherwise, do you have war caster? Okay, so for the time being, you couldn't do it. If you... Well, what cleric class did you take? Because you get that at level one.
Cletus Cobbington 01:48:18 I did protectors so I could get the heavy armor. That was most of the reason why I picked cleric as a multi-class.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:23 Well, he's a...
Dungeon Master 01:48:27 If you read through it, you might have... I don't know if it's the Warcaster specifically one, but as a cleric, you might be able to cast with shields. Sometimes it specifies. Otherwise, you couldn't. Unless you took Warcaster as the feat, too.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:27 Nice.
Cletus Cobbington 01:48:54 I don't know if I had been able to pick a focus of cleric yet. I think it must be like a two or three. Because it was like I got to choose kind of like an order. But one was like something with spellcasting. And one was it's like martial weapons and heavy armor training.
Dungeon Master 01:49:04 Is that level two then? I thought it was level one. It says no sub glass. Can you pick one?
Leopold Magnus 01:49:33 Bye.
Cletus Cobbington 01:49:35 hello um
Dungeon Master 01:49:39 Oh, you do get it at third. That's my bad. Yeah, okay. You'll get it eventually. Anyway, not the point. As you guys go into the next room, this is the sixth floor. And as you go up the stairs, this door is like, it's opulent. It's gold and lapis and it's very posh. It's like very rich and snobby.
Dungeon Master 01:50:08 And there is a mouse-shaped carving over the name plaque on the door. And instead of saying the name, it says, speak my name to enter. You haven't gotten into the room yet. No, you're in the next room up.
Kaladen Shash 01:50:28 Do we see anything in the room that would give us? This is floor six. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:50:29 I push Chip into the outline of the rat, see if he fits, clicks in.
Zariel Torgan 01:50:29 Wouldn't this be the Lord Marshall? Oh, okay. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:50:43 Not quite. Close but just not there.
Cletus Cobbington 01:51:00 Speak my name. Rat shit.
Kaladen Shash 01:51:10 Do we see any clues in the room as to who this council member might have been? Is there any name on the piano or personal pieces still in the room?
Leopold Magnus 01:51:23 Yeah. Or we can maybe go back to the other desks.
Dungeon Master 01:51:29 Give me a perception check. Yeah, it'll be all a combined thing. So there is... You guys are asking all the right questions. So as you guys are moving, you're going to backtrack through the different offices, see if you can find something that would suggest the order and who's next and who you haven't seen and mentioned. So everybody give me... We'll do a combined...
Cletus Cobbington 01:51:30 you you
Zariel Torgan 01:51:32 Isn't there a hierarchy? Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:51:56 group perception or investigation check as you're like scouring through to try to figure out this name 25 god damn you're so good at those 13 23 28 uh it takes a little bit but you um
Zariel Torgan 01:52:06 receive a lot.
Leopold Magnus 01:52:08 Go. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:52:10 Oh, look at you guys.
Cletus Cobbington 01:52:13 you
Dungeon Master 01:52:22 Some of it is intuition using more wisdom based of your mental prowess. And some of it is like the detective work. You find some pictures of all of the Lords sort of standing side to side, like they took a group sort of painting portrayed and it's not named, but you have a sense of all the people. And then you start piecing things with like,
Cyrus Schwert 01:52:29 than your baby.
Dungeon Master 01:52:50 what the personality type was, and then the names that you know, and maybe you look for symbols on the robes, things like that, and you pin down who a couple of them are, and eventually, combined with some of the receipts that you had seen in the previous scroll room that didn't mean anything to you, you have a pretty good guess with that combined check that this next office is the Lord of Advancement, and that person's name is
Cletus Cobbington 01:53:17 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:53:18 Not a fan of Nunu Arbor's Lord of Advancement. As an aside. Well, shall we go back? Yeah, let's do it.
Dungeon Master 01:53:19 coronal sandoro okay
Zariel Torgan 01:53:29 Hey, while I'm thinking about it, because I mentioned it, or I thought about it when you mentioned it, I don't know if anybody else thought it was also relevant. So the guy mentions in the book,
Kaladen Shash 01:53:38 Speak that name. Yep. Yep.
Cletus Cobbington 01:53:54 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:58 the big animals that come in to help him take over the city. We've already killed the phoenix, and we've already killed the spider. Are we thinking that the big lupine dog thing is our homeboy from back at our dome? Because... Are you muted?
Kaladen Shash 01:54:14 He must be. He escaped with the refugees potentially. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:54:15 Yeah, that sounds like it.
Dungeon Master 01:54:17 I love thinking. I didn't come through. I think you said it too quick. No, now we just can't hear him. I think this is embarrassing for you, not for us. I'm kidding. I would like to hear your voice.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:28 Oh. Now he's muted. I think he was trying to say something about bringing up a spider pillow. Where is he? Is he gone? He's gone.
Cletus Cobbington 01:54:29 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:54:47 Yes. Hey, what'd you say? I really liked it.
Kaladen Shash 01:54:48 And east. That's betrothal.
Leopold Magnus 01:54:53 Yeah, that's insightful. That's a pretty good poll.
Cyrus Schwert 01:54:58 Hear me now? Okay. It just will keep going. All I said was Jonathan was smiling when you said that, so it must be true. Grinning. We're going to speak that name into the thing.
Cletus Cobbington 01:55:00 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:55:24 yes let's go
Dungeon Master 01:55:25 Yes, you guys do that. As you guys go into this room, it definitely has a shop feel, despite what the photo says. There is...
Dungeon Master 01:55:35 different like tables and workbenches and like armored frames and in this room you find a bowl of they're purely rubies some of them are finely cut some of them are still worked but you find 200 gold worth of rubies sitting on and you can tell that this person was using rubies to like
Cletus Cobbington 01:55:36 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:55:52 Oh yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:55:55 embed in this armor suit for something and leopold as you're looking around um you've been having an eye out for like specific correspondence with other people um you're looking for one between new new arbor but this one you find in this room is a correspondence with a high lord from the east dome which at this point would have fallen
Zariel Torgan 01:56:03 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:56:21 So this must have been a little bit older. But the correspondence is talking about how this person claimed to have created a new incantation that can transfer the essence of a creature into a soul gem without the loss of sentience. And in this correspondence, there is a proposal to...
Zariel Torgan 01:56:44 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:56:44 you you
Dungeon Master 01:56:46 secure criminals and prisoners prisoners from moon havens like barracks and send them to this person for like testing audits because he wasn't allowed to do it in the east dome so he's sort of reaching out to this person being like will you send me your criminals um no answer or anything and there's no like other names mentioned but um that's what you find specifically when you're looking at
Leopold Magnus 01:57:10 Was this in the office of the Lord of Advancement? I see. Okay. Does their office have any workbench or any lab space? It seems like this person's role, they'd be actively crafting. Everything's kind of scattered.
Dungeon Master 01:57:15 This is in the Lord of Advancements office, yes.
Kaladen Shash 01:57:17 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:57:17 you
Dungeon Master 01:57:28 Yeah, there's a bunch in the room, just various tables. This is a long time ago, so even though it's kind of advanced, very druidic, and it's not as advanced as some of the stuff. But like you've seen, there was armor pieces being enchanted with ruby as part of the engraving process. So there is some partially old enchanted armor stuff.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:41 you
Dungeon Master 01:57:51 There's like some other tools, but it's, you're looking at it. It's nothing that you don't like already utilize. They're like enchanting tools, alchemy stuff, all this stuff that you already have is just sort of what you see around the area.
Cletus Cobbington 01:58:04 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:58:06 Is there anything that was left in progress or near completion or just like left hastily that looks like they would have been working on? Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:58:15 I mean, interestingly enough, nothing that is, like, close. Like, nothing had been enchanted. There's no magic in here, if that's what you're looking for. But with beyond the rubies that you found, there is a suit of plate armor sitting on the table. Somebody else makes it.
Kaladen Shash 01:58:29 So it sounds like, yeah. How about that?
Leopold Magnus 01:58:33 Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm going to come up to that plate armor and see if I can tune it up and give it to Cletus. I'll tune it up. Might be able to enchant it with some extra protection or something.
Cletus Cobbington 01:58:34 30 AC, here we come. I ascend.
Cyrus Schwert 01:58:37 I want that.
Zariel Torgan 01:58:42 Yeah, let's roll for it, guys. He jumps from 13 to like 40 AC. Oh, that's great.
Dungeon Master 01:58:57 I think that puts a minimum 18. Yeah. Would you like her flavor? You fuck with the rubies.
Leopold Magnus 01:59:07 I'll tell you what, can I try something to give it just a little buff? Whatever you decide, if it seems reasonable. So I've got a lot of souls. Yeah, yeah. Exactly, yeah. So I've got these souls that I've absorbed into Light Splitter. Not Light Splitter, sorry. The Searing Saber, right? I've killed the Lithid guy. I killed one of the Gnoll Leader dude. Did I kill a spider with this sword?
Dungeon Master 01:59:33 What are you trying to do?
Leopold Magnus 01:59:39 I have to double check. I got some pretty powerful souls in there. Can I try to transmute one of those into a small buff into the armor? Let's see. I'll do the gnoll. Or no, I'll do the lithid. Yeah, go ahead.
Cletus Cobbington 01:59:45 you you
Kaladen Shash 02:00:04 Can we say for flavor? Can we say for flavor? I'm just helping out. And the ring that I've been enchanting to hold those few shield castings is what Rex is also utilizing on the armor, just to one shot that off. Mechanically, it can just be the suit that does it. Sweet.
Dungeon Master 02:00:22 Okay. Yeah, 100%. So that would work. But what kind of buff are you trying to put on there, Leopold? Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 02:00:31 Yeah. So I was going to use the lithid elder brain that we killed, which I think the sword absorbed. Cletus, you don't have any psychic resistance or psychic protection, right? Because that's only Cyrus with a choker.
Cletus Cobbington 02:00:32 Yeah, correct.
Leopold Magnus 02:00:51 uh i'll i'll try to impart some kind of resistance to psychic damage or some ability to withhold like basically uh like gain advantage on a check that has to do with like some mind control or some kind of domination you know something along those lines that an illithid would be powerful and
Kaladen Shash 02:01:03 The.
Dungeon Master 02:01:10 Yeah. I think that's perfectly fair. Go ahead and give me like a combined Arcana check as you sort of like spot weld this ring into the chest piece, like right in the center, very Iron Man-esque, and put this buff into it as you do it.
Cletus Cobbington 02:01:23 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:01:37 22. Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:01:39 And 19. Yeah, that's great. You have successfully done it. It'll just be we can create the item later than a plate armor with the ability of a ring of stealth stealth during with psychic resistance.
Cyrus Schwert 02:01:55 Right. Sick.
Zariel Torgan 02:01:55 That's for me. Nice.
Kaladen Shash 02:01:59 Excellent. I don't know what the gold cost was on that, Jonathan.
Cletus Cobbington 02:02:01 Damn.
Leopold Magnus 02:02:07 That was Ariel. I could think of something for you later. Maybe once we get back to the workshop.
Dungeon Master 02:02:10 Just swiped it. And Kaladin, you are now free for another project if you want it.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:28 I think we had initially put maybe like a quarter of the funds towards it. And that might've been like two or 300 gold. Like you had like a price workout for like a, an uncommon magical item. So that's the only thing I would just pull that off. Some there's REO.
Dungeon Master 02:02:41 Yeah, let me pull up the thing. Uncommon is 2,000 gold. And you put down a quarter of it, so... Or did you put down half of what you did? Okay, so 1,500. It'd be like the investment left.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:47 Yeah, I can. I can distract just take that off. 1500 Alright, take it off. Good.
Leopold Magnus 02:02:52 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:02:57 Tim.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:59 I think we put a quarter, and then we put 500. That might have been all the gold I had at the time. Yeah, cool. I'll go ahead and use...
Dungeon Master 02:03:10 So a penny for a powerful item.
Kaladen Shash 02:03:28 uh level one shield and a level three fireball that's four so that should be the two spells we can hold for now
Dungeon Master 02:03:40 Okay. You have a shield and a fireball in your armor. As you guys yeah you
Zariel Torgan 02:03:41 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:03:48 Nice.
Cyrus Schwert 02:03:49 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:03:53 Me? Or him? What the fuck?
Dungeon Master 02:03:56 I'll have to make it. It's going to be a cool Iron Man armor thing. As you guys ascend to the next floor, it becomes very nature-y and druidic, and there are vines growing out the doorway as you see a hanging sign that says, Lord Guardian of the Land, Salathia Moonglade.
Kaladen Shash 02:04:00 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:04:20 And you walk in, and it is this beautiful, lush greenhouse with a bunch of flower beds and everything. And it's just very pretty and gardening. All of these beautiful orchids. And you see some of them have these little spots on the petals to give them this really unique look. They're like a vibrant blue.
Dungeon Master 02:04:48 And as you guys walk in, there's almost like a magically induced breeze that kind of blows some leaves off the ground. What do you want to do? This is Lord Guardian of the Land.
Cletus Cobbington 02:04:54 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:05:00 Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 02:05:12 What is this the council member of? Guardian of the land. OK. Yeah. Do we see anything of note on tables or other surfaces, scrolls, letters?
Dungeon Master 02:05:19 It's like the druid in power. You'd have to sort of move through the garden space. You see there's a desk slash table on the back corner. But you guys haven't entered the room yet. So far, everything has been trapped.
Dungeon Master 02:05:48 There's no obvious stuff yet, but this is before you enter the room to get to there. What do you want to do?
Kaladen Shash 02:06:04 Can anyone detect anything? Blush.
Cletus Cobbington 02:06:08 You said there's a bunch of ivy and it's just like there's a garden in here. It's not just ivy.
Dungeon Master 02:06:13 Yeah, the whole thing is very garden-esque space, but the main things that you see are amongst all of the various foliage and flowers, there are these...
Dungeon Master 02:06:26 like larger than they should be orchids that have these blue spots on their petals that are very alluring and pretty to look at. And they seem to be like equally spread out. And the rest is just general green crawling foliage, large-leaved plants that kind of take up the most sunlight on the ground.
Cyrus Schwert 02:06:50 Do I touch the flower? I'll touch a flower. I try to pick a flower. That makes sense. One I'm really good at. Ooh. Doesn't matter if you're rolling it.
Zariel Torgan 02:06:53 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:06:55 Take a look.
Cletus Cobbington 02:07:00 Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:07:03 Give me a constitution saving throw.
Kaladen Shash 02:07:06 Sounds about right. Let's go.
Dungeon Master 02:07:17 why um you see as you walk up to pick the flower as you like touch the flower and disrupt it the little blue dots on it explode and you see like clouds of spores hit your face um and you avoid being poisoned and having like your like nothing happens doesn't take effect in your brain um
Cletus Cobbington 02:07:30 is insulin curbing.
Kaladen Shash 02:07:40 He just sneezes. Is there no clear path through the area?
Zariel Torgan 02:07:42 Maybe we
Dungeon Master 02:07:43 He just kind of sneezed. And that's like the first part of it. So that happens and you kind of brush it away and then you look for it and you know, it's like, there are a lot of these orchids in there and you'd have to deal with all of them somehow seem to go off when you touch it. There's an obvious path, but the orchids definitely line it.
Cyrus Schwert 02:08:09 Is there like a jug of Raid or something?
Kaladen Shash 02:08:12 Can I just use burning hands and just blast a...
Zariel Torgan 02:08:18 Yeah. Can we...
Dungeon Master 02:08:18 Yeah. You ignite this area. You're sculpting it to not burn everything else, but you go scorched earth, you know, like Vietnam napalm drop kind of burn everything in this room. And as it dies down and everything's just charred and black, you burn the air too so the spores get singed and are just dust on the ground. You guys walk to the other side of the room. Only thing of note as you search through everything is a...
Dungeon Master 02:08:47 bound black journal and the black bounding seems to be like it almost looks like worked bark like somehow they like made the bark leathery and then bound it into a book um and it's just it's just like tied together but that's the only thing that is slightly interesting in here
Zariel Torgan 02:09:08 Does anybody have Mage Hand? Gotcha. I was just thinking it would be handy. You do? I mean, that's always super handy for seeing if something's trapped when you move it.
Leopold Magnus 02:09:11 I have a spell that I can summon a familiar. Not Bone Crusher, but like a smaller.
Cletus Cobbington 02:09:12 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 02:09:13 I do have Mage Hand. I do, for some reason. Yeah, I'm going to jiggle that thing.
Kaladen Shash 02:09:31 Great.
Dungeon Master 02:09:35 all right got it uh you open it and you see a lot of it is just um like drawings of plants and like like almost like um i like how mendel would do like p diagram like it's just dissecting the plant anatomy and
Zariel Torgan 02:09:41 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:10:00 labeling and it's just very naturey and hippie and you're flipping through the pages with your mage hand it doesn't seem to be trapped so you could take over and do it yourself if you wanted but eventually you get to a spot where you see there is like a physical entry like a lot of words had been written and it's not just pictures do you want to read it
Cyrus Schwert 02:10:21 Is this also about plants, this text section? I would like to read it, I think, yes. I would like to read it out loud, if possible. I'm like 95% sure. It's going to take way too long. I'm pretty sure.
Dungeon Master 02:10:33 And you read Elven, right? Yeah, I think you're half Elven. Does that make sense? Yeah. Anyway, this is an entry from the Lord Guardian of the High Council. And it's just this...
Kaladen Shash 02:10:37 We love you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:10:39 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 02:10:41 Mm-hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 02:10:53 Yes.
Dungeon Master 02:10:58 she is talking about um how she feels like there is this sensation in the land like a horrible power had been created um and a mutation of the natural order was taking place um and it is being amplified closer to the arcane well springs that the dome surrounds so it's
Cletus Cobbington 02:11:15 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:11:20 affecting the inhabitants differently than it otherwise should. And then you see there is this note
Dungeon Master 02:11:29 like as you're flipping through on one of the pages that says meet at blank park at this time and as like the map location dictates like a little drawing on it it is approximately where Leopold found that bag that had that arcane drawing on it
Cletus Cobbington 02:11:50 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:11:57 I read that message a lot. City clear.
Leopold Magnus 02:12:00 We never quite investigated, right? Yeah, did we look at that in that bag? Didn't I just pick it up as we're moving? Do we come back to it? Ah, right. Got it.
Dungeon Master 02:12:16 That is that teleportation circle alteration thing you found. That was that area. So you think that what you found was from that. Not a lot of context for what it means yet.
Cyrus Schwert 02:12:31 Got it.
Leopold Magnus 02:12:34 Was that the scroll that I found when we were in the water? Got it. Right. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:12:41 No, that was the thing that you found in this session earlier that is like to a specific teleportation circle alters the destination with like the specific changes that would make it a feasible check. Like it was, I think it was in that 20 or 25 or something. I don't even remember what
Leopold Magnus 02:13:03 Did I ever look into that scroll that I found underwater? OK, well, we don't have to. Let's look back. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:13:11 You're talking about, I think you found a map, but I don't remember anything beyond that. And the map was the district map, but we could find it for sure in some way. What would you guys like to do?
Zariel Torgan 02:13:39 Well, I think we got everything out of this room, right? Yeah, it's set up.
Kaladen Shash 02:13:41 Last, yeah, last floor. Second to last.
Cyrus Schwert 02:13:45 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:13:48 Second to last four. There are nine fours. This is now eight fours.
Dungeon Master 02:13:51 This one seems to be not like an actual room that you would pass through. So it doesn't belong to any sort of high official. You know, you're going through these tunnels, constantly ascending big rooms in between passageways. And this is just sort of like a foyer to the next room. But in the center, there is a sort of lightly thrumming and brightening and dimming crystal that starts to be floating in space, kind of blocking the main path.
Cletus Cobbington 02:14:16 Bye.
Cyrus Schwert 02:14:29 Hmm.
Zariel Torgan 02:14:35 Anything jumping out at us as relevant or does it seem...
Kaladen Shash 02:14:41 Do we see anything beyond this floating crystal? Is the crystal in the room or right in the threshold?
Dungeon Master 02:14:45 There's a pretty elegant and very intricately carved wooden door beyond it that seems to be some much more grand space and office.
Dungeon Master 02:15:05 It's like, yeah, you guys are standing in the entryway. Halfway down the room, in the center of the room, is this floating crystal. And then other end of the room is the doorway, just right in the middle. Yes, you can. This gives off magic from the school of evocation.
Kaladen Shash 02:15:14 Okay. Can I test identify on this crystal?
Dungeon Master 02:15:35 And you learn that if you were to touch the crystal or cast a spell within 15 feet of it, that it would detonate. And it redirects and changes the damage type randomly. So you don't know what you're going to get hit with. But that is all there is to it.
Cletus Cobbington 02:15:40 I saw some of the Rizzlers.
Kaladen Shash 02:16:01 They convey this to everybody. Don't cast anything. Fireball. What's this other spell? And there's nothing else in the room.
Zariel Torgan 02:16:08 fireball we get around it with with these
Cyrus Schwert 02:16:10 Yeah. Go around it to the next color.
Cletus Cobbington 02:16:14 It summons three dragons.
Dungeon Master 02:16:21 Yeah, if you don't touch it, you just walk right by it. This is just like a middle space. As you get to the final room, and at the very top of it, it says, First Council of Moonhaven, a Larian Duskblade. And as you walk into it, it's a very elegant room of fine wooden desks sort of carved out of the floor.
Kaladen Shash 02:16:32 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:16:51 big regal chair there's sort of an open glass that kind of overlooks the city as this is the top of it um what would you guys like to do yeah like like like as you would expect of like the top wizard or whatever of a city there's like a very
Zariel Torgan 02:17:06 So there was a wooden desk.
Dungeon Master 02:17:17 obvious like entry and then like the center of the room is this big
Dungeon Master 02:17:23 magnificent desk with a chair behind it and there's like a little you know private quarters to the side you see like a fountain and like a little water area some books on shelves that like are just like history and art just like a very nice office space but yes there is a desk this map it puts it on makes it look like a bedroom but that was just the top of the tower map so disregard the lush bed in the center
Cletus Cobbington 02:17:38 The lush bed.
Zariel Torgan 02:17:42 Yeah. Can I go through the desk? See if there's anything cool in there?
Kaladen Shash 02:17:54 large desk yes yeah he just starts to look very curious
Cyrus Schwert 02:18:07 Can I
Dungeon Master 02:18:09 So you enter the room. Yes, Zariel, time feels strange here. As you're walking in, you start hearing a weird ticking noise slowing through the air, kind of echoing, despite there's no visible source to it.
Zariel Torgan 02:18:11 Oh, I guess I'd have to to do that.
Dungeon Master 02:18:34 As you're stepping in, every step on your foot that kind of slows and hits the ground, you see resonates and there's this huge rune on the ground of the entire room that you've stepped onto. Everybody from the outside of the room watches as...
Dungeon Master 02:18:51 it almost looks like you reverse in time, even though time doesn't change for them. And you repeat the last actions for six seconds. So you reverse back to the beginning of the room and then walk back in to the center and go ahead and give me a wisdom saving throw as everybody watches you paralyzed. So you can't do something about it. Just sort of walk forward and then rewind and then walk forward and then rewind and then walk forward and rewind.
Cletus Cobbington 02:18:55 I'm not.
Kaladen Shash 02:19:18 Infinite Luke just stuck. He's glitching.
Zariel Torgan 02:19:22 24.
Cyrus Schwert 02:19:27 He's lagging super bad.
Dungeon Master 02:19:27 wisdom saving throw should be pretty good. Only four. After like three or four times as you hit like the, you're like backing up to the beginning of the room, you have just enough mental fortitude that you sort of push yourself on your back heel and you fall out of the space of the room and everything sort of resumes to normal for you.
Zariel Torgan 02:19:49 I don't know if you guys saw that, but don't just walk in there.
Kaladen Shash 02:19:51 You're not happy with your current pillow? You seem to enjoy it quite a bit. Your cum pillow? It's never looked so good. Look how cool your hairdo is.
Cyrus Schwert 02:19:56 I want one of those pillows on that bed so bad. Oh, my God. Do you see my hair, Alden? It looks crazy. Like, stuffed up. I'm not in panic at the disco. I don't need to have hair like this.
Leopold Magnus 02:19:57 What are we doing over there? You know, I think there's some money in that.
Dungeon Master 02:20:00 It's so bad.
Cletus Cobbington 02:20:09 It's just so gelled.
Kaladen Shash 02:20:21 It's how all the heroes wear their today. Also, there's money in the come. How do you know this? It's like, I don't see any money.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:28 That condensed, unrefined, moist spider silk. Money in the Cubs.
Zariel Torgan 02:20:34 This is.
Cyrus Schwert 02:20:40 There's money in the cup. I changed my mind. Egg donor.
Dungeon Master 02:20:40 What do you guys want to do? You're at the beginning of the room.
Cletus Cobbington 02:20:48 That spider must have been a donor. He's getting paid for that. There's no way that much was left and they wasn't getting paid. Am I right?
Kaladen Shash 02:20:59 All right. Do we see anything? Do we sense anything? Or if I cast identify, it's going to have to be on an individual object to see if they're causing the effect. Can we see any runes or
Dungeon Master 02:21:23 If you cast, yeah, you spend 10 minutes, you cast identify, and then after your identify goes off, it reveals that the glyph at the bottom of the floor that you saw light up when Zariel walked in is the source, and its effect is exactly what you saw. When a creature enters the space, they are paralyzed, and they repeat their actions from the last six seconds over and over again in a loop.
Dungeon Master 02:21:51 Completing a wisdom saving throw lets them sort of eject themselves to gain composure. You also learn that the hidden effect is that repeat offenders going into this space risk getting exhaustion. So even if he succeeded and he pumped out first time, he still might completely drain himself crying.
Cletus Cobbington 02:21:59 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:15 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 02:22:15 Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 02:22:15 Can I hit that tile or the glyph with a firebolt? Quick blast.
Dungeon Master 02:22:24 Uh, you hit it with a quick fire bolt and it doesn't seem like it has the effect you want. Like it hits the floor and the floor is solid stone. So even though the glyph is there, it's gotta be a little bit more than that to disrupt it.
Kaladen Shash 02:22:43 Leopold, get your lightsaber over here. Fresh this up. Let's go.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:46 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:22:47 Yeah, take a swing. Yeah, once per day I can slice and dice any, I think pretty much any object or certain thickness.
Dungeon Master 02:22:56 Do you want to use your overcharge ability, the one that can destroy the objects? Yeah, it would work for this. A normal attack wouldn't be effective enough again, but you see Leopold, like,
Cyrus Schwert 02:22:56 There you go.
Kaladen Shash 02:23:19 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:23:19 expands like all of the battery in a quick mode as it like rapidly drains the source you see his like lightsaber flares up and it's like this ball of fire as he turns it down it embeds it and like a lightsaber it like melts through the floor and eventually he does enough damage deep enough that you see the faint rune flicker out and dispel as you retract your saber and there's like the melting stone dripping into the hole that you created
Leopold Magnus 02:23:48 Oh, well, that better do it. It's all free for you guys.
Kaladen Shash 02:23:55 Can we investigate the desk? Is there anything of note? Correspondence, scrolls, is there a magic book left behind? Is there a whole book?
Cletus Cobbington 02:23:57 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:23:59 Yes, you can. No magic book. But you would learn that through the general stuff, and I'll tell you why. So in this room, there is correspondence, and Leopold tags this as well, with the High Council of Nunu Arbor. And this is the new one. So she was incredibly young when she hit this role.
Dungeon Master 02:24:25 um the current high council of new new arbor is still fava storm singer so she is a near pure blood dragonborn who is incredibly old but when she has like been newly elected into the council this is like during that time and so through these letters they seem to be pretty close and you
Dungeon Master 02:24:49 learned that they had gone to like the same arcane school in moonhaven um when they were even younger because they're both sorcerers so they have a lot of innate magic but they aren't wizards
Dungeon Master 02:25:04 but they're just incredibly powerful sorcerers. And this all makes sense, learning that this is who this person is, because when you're reading all this stuff, it talks about how Stormsinger offers safe harbor for the inhabitants, offers aid and soldiers and even personal intervention. And then you have like the thought back to that security footage you kind of saw that had the
Dungeon Master 02:25:30 the very tall dark haired elven gentleman and the dragonborn stood up to that dark shadowy figure they were thrown apart but then that would just mean that she survived that whole thing um but as you continue to read this it just shows that like after enough of them go by uh the first council of new new arbor basically says that like hey if moon haven is breached we're cutting off
Dungeon Master 02:25:58 teleportation ability to new new arbor we can't risk the army getting through so you have that there and then it discusses this intricate plan for them to try to trap the cursed king by letting him get exactly to where they want him and then activating this multi-part trap
Dungeon Master 02:26:17 that flooded the city and then forced the water into a arcane circle. Uh, and because the spell targeted the water, he couldn't counter it because it wasn't against him. Uh, and like, it just was like really mapped out with subtle spell casting and extended distances and all these like very sorcerer specific things to fight this known wizard, this mage who'd gone crazy. And, uh,
Dungeon Master 02:26:44 Then it talks about how this was the last trap possible. And this is the only time you've ever seen this name written out. It says, To Stop Tentherian. And it's capitalized and it's spelled. I'll just copy that into the thing.
Leopold Magnus 02:27:03 Probably worth spelling just for the Craig. Yeah. That would be the crazy king. Got it.
Kaladen Shash 02:27:06 In theory, yeah. He was the nightmare sort of dude. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:27:10 It is Tentherian, T-E-N-T-H-Y-R-Y-E-N. No last name given, almost like on a first name basis. Send this figure into the astral sea. That would be the cursed king.
Dungeon Master 02:27:31 And then at the very last thing, you guys find like this thing tucked in one of the drawers in the bottom right as everybody's sort of looking at different stuff. It mentions that there's a failsafe plan to have the Lord Guardian develop a spell capable of sending an individual to a known tree in the far north outside of the anti-life field that is the Ashen Grove by the Tree of Death.
Leopold Magnus 02:27:31 Presumably the trap worked.
Dungeon Master 02:28:00 And it mentions possibility of forcing open Feywild Realm. And that's all the list of note in this room. No magical items. It's like... It's written that there is a failsafe to develop
Kaladen Shash 02:28:08 he said he had a way he just mentioned he knows how to do it or it's written in this letter scroll
Leopold Magnus 02:28:13 That was just like a separate...
Dungeon Master 02:28:25 a way to send people to the North instead of wherever else. And then like, just thinking about it, this is what Leopold has. Leopold has the alterations created by the Lord Guardian to change. So you could potentially teleport to like the Tree of Death in the North instead of New Harbor. But it would have to be from the tree in the city. So you couldn't do it later on.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:38 So we could potentially teleport to this other circle. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Love that. Yeah. No, circle. We just have the circle we're trying to activate.
Leopold Magnus 02:28:57 But could you come back from the tree? Or it's like a one-time use? Okay. So that could be a potential option.
Kaladen Shash 02:29:10 Right, Jonathan, it sounds like these are teleportation circles, or is this just like a teleporting through a tree stump type thing? Right.
Dungeon Master 02:29:18 unclear that's a great thing you said because you would know that historically druids can do transfer via plants and that the lord guardian of the land would likely be a druid so it's
Zariel Torgan 02:29:26 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:29:34 Probably like the same concept, though, like the druid cast that spell into a tree enough times that it had gone somewhere. And this is like the druidic version of altering that spell. So this is not...
Kaladen Shash 02:29:50 He's a wizard. That's why it's written that we could do it. Excellent.
Dungeon Master 02:29:52 Yeah, so this is a, you sort of found with that first initial nat 20, they had a way to get to the far north, and it's not by teleportation circle, it's by, like, travel via plants. So you have a druidic way to get to the north that you can do with wizard magic.
Leopold Magnus 02:30:16 So is that unrelated to the ability to use our transportation circle or is that the same thing? Right. Got it.
Dungeon Master 02:30:24 You did, it would be different. So you would know that this is not the teleportation circle you're looking for to get to new new artists. So you could in theory, activate that one if you wanted to do it. But this would be elsewhere, maybe in the same area, you're not totally sure.
Kaladen Shash 02:30:29 A side trip to open the Fae realm. Is that what the correspondent said?
Leopold Magnus 02:30:48 So I guess we could take a side trip then. Is that what it sounds like? Sounds like it, yeah. Interesting tidbit.
Dungeon Master 02:30:54 And I will say simultaneously, so as you guys read that aside, but right before that, when the name Tentherian had been said, Zariel, give me a constitution saving throw.
Cyrus Schwert 02:31:09 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:31:23 Interesting. Let's try in 3020.
Kaladen Shash 02:31:24 Good enough You are not here
Dungeon Master 02:31:37 Oney, nice. That is good enough. You are... Oh, did he just drop out? That's embarrassing. What you guys see is that Zariel starts almost going to seize. He starts shaking and he falls to one knee, but he manages to pull himself together. Welcome back.
Cyrus Schwert 02:31:53 Are you embarrassed?
Dungeon Master 02:32:09 You should be embarrassed. That was just incredibly cake on your face, egg on your eyebrows, you know, just so bad. That's true. You have C-U-M-S-S on your face. Zariel, when you hear that name,
Zariel Torgan 02:32:09 I'm here. I'm back. Yeah, at least it's food and not ejaculate. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:32:25 you
Cyrus Schwert 02:32:26 That's what I always say.
Dungeon Master 02:32:35 Everybody else sees you almost go into like a seizure. Your body starts to shake and you fall to one knee, but you pull yourself together and you have like a recurrence of a lost memory. But it's almost just like a bunch of memories flashing into you at the same time of how many times you've heard that name. Tentherian, Tentherian, Tentherian over and over and over again. And then you have like just an audio clip playing in your head of the
Dungeon Master 02:33:02 Like the name you've heard so much. This is First Council of the Western Dome, Tentherian Arc Soul, High Mage of the Four Domes. Esoptera. The West Dome is where the Esoptera first was born, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:16 Interesting. A big Eastie.
Cyrus Schwert 02:33:17 On name. East.
Leopold Magnus 02:33:18 Do we know the West Dome's name? That was the subject, yeah. North versus South. What's the East Dome's name? Can you remind me?
Dungeon Master 02:33:36 Great question. Oh, it would be in here. Hold on. I have to find my whole... I don't know what I'm doing. We have the whole map. East Dome was Phylantra.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:52 EZE. All.
Leopold Magnus 02:33:58 Violentra, okay.
Dungeon Master 02:34:08 This is a good touch base point. So you guys are here right now. You, in theory, were told that you have a way to get up there, which Kaladin has some sort of mission to get towards. Philantra is right there. You guys are from Nunu Arbor. And Esoptera is like in the swamplands of the west, way over there.
Leopold Magnus 02:34:39 Sorry, Kaladin's quest is at the Tree of Life? Right, from the well, yep. Oh, the Tree of Death. OK, which is where we can travel to using this magic, right? Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:34:43 It was part of the vision. Rick.
Dungeon Master 02:34:43 He had that whole vision about drinking from the Wellspring and then traveling to the Tree of Death for some sort of ritual that he has buried in his body. He has the sense that if he went there, he could complete it.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:06 That's big. Mm hmm. So.
Leopold Magnus 02:35:13 Right on. Got some good intel in this tower. Up to you.
Cyrus Schwert 02:35:24 Is the hat store open yet? So you see our dilemma.
Dungeon Master 02:35:24 But where would you guys like to go now? You guys want to go outside and check? Yeah, I mean, you might get stuck again.
Cletus Cobbington 02:35:32 teleportation.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:34 Yeah, it's gotta be below water by now. I don't wanna, I got stuck last time. Hmm. I say we just run really fast.
Kaladen Shash 02:35:37 Maybe you should retrieve. Are we seeing it? Are we seeing it's next day already?
Leopold Magnus 02:35:46 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:36:02 No, it's probably evening at this point. You guys have been in the tower for a long time. But looking through the windows at this level, you would see that it's getting dark outside. Everybody individually give me perception checks with disadvantage. DC 21.
Kaladen Shash 02:36:07 Oh gosh.
Zariel Torgan 02:36:29 Nice. You can see that hat that I'm after.
Leopold Magnus 02:36:30 Deception check with disadvantage. It's good for me. I rolled terribly.
Dungeon Master 02:36:33 disadvantage because it's dark outside and you're looking down into the city. I just want to see if you can see something. 21... Um... Uh...
Kaladen Shash 02:36:38 I have the base of darkvision. Yes, 21. Satish, you're a real adventurer now.
Cyrus Schwert 02:36:41 Let's fucking go. Come on. My eyes. I've been eating carrots.
Dungeon Master 02:37:01 you see um and i very picky about the words really far away it's dark and it's hard to make out because it's a pretty dark shape itself you're up way up in the ninth floor of this mage tower looking down at the illyrian district you see this like reptilian serpent like
Dungeon Master 02:37:24 creature like moving through the trees very slowly and you know like having a hard time looking at and it almost looks like it's got this crazy head of like different tentacles and stuff it's hard to make out from this distance but there is definitely something down there
Kaladen Shash 02:37:31 Is it slithering? Like actually like serpentine or is it like lizard crawling?
Cyrus Schwert 02:37:40 Appreciate it, guys. Guys, this is fucked. There's a Medusa-looking motherfucker over there.
Leopold Magnus 02:37:51 Oh dear.
Dungeon Master 02:37:54 It's kind of like crawling, but really... What's the word I'm looking for? It's stumbling around. It's not graceful at all in its movement. And so it looks like...
Zariel Torgan 02:37:58 uh,
Dungeon Master 02:38:13 almost like a snake that's kind of moving passively how they kind of like pearl and they'll kind of push and not get always all the way forward like it is kind of like just winding through all the brush yeah you're well over 100 feet in the air and like looking down into like basically a tree line because it's so much foliage
Cletus Cobbington 02:38:17 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:38:26 That's like way off in the distance. We're up in the top of the tower.
Dungeon Master 02:38:39 in this district at night so the fact that he got it with the 21 is because it's so hard but he like catches this creature that you had missed before that you had like seen that something was moving now he's got like eyes on it's huge and it's like hulking around kind of
Cyrus Schwert 02:39:02 That thing looks fucked. I pull Khalid on a sign. I'm just trying to be a supportive friend. I don't want that. Oh, but it's clear that he needs one. Okay, perfect.
Kaladen Shash 02:39:05 You sure you want to go GitHub now? Is it a good idea? Clearly very upset. Okay, I understand what you're saying. We'll see what we can do.
Leopold Magnus 02:39:09 Oh, Pat's hats had quite fine haberdasheries.
Zariel Torgan 02:39:18 He really needs this. I mean, if you guys want, we can go tonight. We can wait. It's whatever.
Cletus Cobbington 02:39:23 No.
Dungeon Master 02:39:31 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 02:39:34 all of us want mechanical bowler hats like your bear
Kaladen Shash 02:39:42 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:39:47 Well, I suppose we should probably wait for daylight if we're going to go down there with that critter.
Zariel Torgan 02:39:55 Alright, yeah, that's fair. Before we go to bed, can I try scrying on a couple people? Thank you. Uh, I'd like to scry on Wolf Daddy. Hmm?
Dungeon Master 02:40:07 Do you have scry? Hell yeah. Let's do this. Who do you want to scry on? On Lord Marshall. Okay. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:40:14 That's awesome.
Kaladen Shash 02:40:21 Yes, Marshall Thurber.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:26 So wisdom 17. Probably like really low wisdom. Negative.
Dungeon Master 02:40:36 Just give me one second. I might actually have a character sheet built for this guy. Otherwise, I'm just going to figure out what it would be. Doesn't have great wisdom. So you said wisdom saving throw?
Cyrus Schwert 02:41:00 Pretty good.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:04 Yeah, 17 is my DC.
Dungeon Master 02:41:11 It's not rolling on the thing, but let me... Oh, it did roll. That's cool. Not even the same campaign. With a natural one, he fails. So your little invisible strike orb kind of pops up on him.
Kaladen Shash 02:41:32 That's right.
Leopold Magnus 02:41:35 Christ.
Dungeon Master 02:41:41 And you're going to get a lot of information. So this will have to be where we end after this. But how long does Skry last for? It's like 10 minutes or something? Okay. You see, you're isolated on the Lord Marshal, but his positioning is so key.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:46 Yeah, I'm almost positive it's 10 minutes. I just closed it so I could see the map. 10 minutes. It's easier. Oh, go ahead. Sorry, go ahead.
Cyrus Schwert 02:41:54 It's a long time.
Dungeon Master 02:42:05 The fact that you picked him first. He is in a werewolf form. This large, monstrous creature is just curled up in this awkward-looking ball on this makeshift bed. There's this huge collar around his neck.
Dungeon Master 02:42:27 thick chains connect them to a wall you hear some muffled speaking in the background like a lot of different conversations from different spots in this room but you can't see it but because you're close enough you see the faint glow that you recognize to be from that being room that you were in in the tunnels beneath the city like he is in that room that you stayed in that night
Zariel Torgan 02:43:00 Interesting. I mean, I figure might as well go for the full 10. I just basically want to hear anything that's going to be relevant to the citizenry us, you know. Plans.
Dungeon Master 02:43:01 Are you listening for anything specific? Do you cut out early? Do you go to the full end? You hear a lot of like construction type sounds, like arcane welding sounds, like, you know, just spells cranking up real high heat to put things together.
Cletus Cobbington 02:43:10 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:43:29 distant chatter about spells and setting things up and you hear somebody directing people around and eventually you hear a voice just walk up and to like the lord marshal just um in sort of a southern-ish kind of twang just goes and here i thought
Cletus Cobbington 02:43:49 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:43:51 this old dog could learn new tricks, you know, like chuckles to himself and kicks at it before you recognize the voice of the captain, um, gunslinger from the Legionnaire, um, sort of turn heel and walk away before engaging in a conversation out of earshot. Uh, but in this space as well, um,
Dungeon Master 02:44:18 He looked a little bit different when he kind of stepped into your scry space. A little bit cleaned up, better uniform. You notice that when he before had arcane sort of frost bolts that were like really high tech as far as arcane frost bolts go. But now he has like the...
Zariel Torgan 02:44:31 you
Dungeon Master 02:44:41 metal, crossbow-looking things, you know, very similar to what would be a revolver in our world, but, like, you haven't really seen anything like that, really, because nothing was finished being built like that. He's got two, one on each hip.
Dungeon Master 02:45:01 kind of real cocky as he walks away. And you don't get a whole lot out from this scry other than that Lord Marshall seems like almost sedated. Like, for this large creature, he's just, like, slumped over in this bed. Yeah. Oh, jeez, I've got it down somewhere, but...
Leopold Magnus 02:45:15 So the other guy spotted was Captain Levi? What was his full name?
Zariel Torgan 02:45:16 Would I be able to switch over and try to get a scry on Levi real quick to see what the dealio is there?
Cyrus Schwert 02:45:24 First name, Captain. Last name, Levi.
Cletus Cobbington 02:45:38 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:45:46 Yeah, let me see. I don't think I have a character sheet, but I might. Is this still a wisdom saving throw?
Zariel Torgan 02:45:55 Regardless, I'll click off the spell for the attempt. He was real sus. Yeah, 17.
Cyrus Schwert 02:45:57 What?
Kaladen Shash 02:46:00 I think Levi participated when we shut down that first, like, dome splitter. Okay, oh. Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 02:46:06 yeah didn't he
Dungeon Master 02:46:23 That was a 19 on the dice plus 5. 19 plus 5. You said minus 3 out of nowhere. I think that still passes.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:26 Minus three. I never went to college, so does he fail? Damn it. All right. Well, we won't know. I'll let everybody else know that the situation dynamic has changed as far as what we think for the city looks like.
Cyrus Schwert 02:46:38 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:56 Our wolf friend is uh...
Dungeon Master 02:46:57 You know, and I'll give you one more thing, actually. You hear Captain Levi is talking with a different figure who's, like, out of earshot at first, and eventually the voice comes pretty clear, and you hear what you believe to be the voice of the Lord Marshal. Like, sounds exactly identical, like, talking to Captain Levi. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:47:27 And then you'd be current time when you're going to say something. Hell yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:47:28 interesting interesting yeah i will fill everybody in on that interesting
Leopold Magnus 02:47:43 I gotta source check this on the audio, but it looks like his full name is Captain Levi Sanchez. Because you drop a line that says when Captain Levi instructs the party to find the smithy, the last hamhawk, you said, tell her Captain Levi Sanchez will get you hooked up with standard gear, whatever weapons you feel like.
Kaladen Shash 02:47:51 Mmm. Whoa, that's good.
Cyrus Schwert 02:47:52 you
Zariel Torgan 02:48:03 Yeah, every fifth, like, NPC gets a random, like, normal dude name. Like, my name's Joe Smith.
Cletus Cobbington 02:48:09 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:48:10 Hell yeah. The answer. I think that is. I think I have that written somewhere else, too. It's just not in my obsidian vault where I do all my D&D notes. It's in my drive somewhere instead.
Leopold Magnus 02:48:11 I gotta pull the audio, make sure that transcription was correct, because that's ridiculous. Okay. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:48:35 Nice. And it's just thoroughly.
Cyrus Schwert 02:48:35 percent.
Leopold Magnus 02:48:35 No, I just love that. Levi Sanchez. That has a ring to it if he's a revolver-wielding guy. Hamhawk has been busy. So does that mean Hamhawk's in on this? Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:48:42 Now he's got guns. Hamhawk's been busy. Not necessarily. I guess you guys don't know for sure.
Cletus Cobbington 02:48:44 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:49:03 my mentor better not be evil oh and I did look up
Kaladen Shash 02:49:07 Mm hmm.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:08 Not with a name like Hamhock.
Dungeon Master 02:49:11 But then, yeah, we'll end it there. You guys are bedding down for the night. You got your scrys complete. Anybody else want to do anything as we wrap up?
Leopold Magnus 02:49:27 about the scroll so you described finding one while we were swimming it was in a submerged area it was underneath some other disintegrating ones and it was glimmering and untouched which was different from the gold case scroll which was the map so i don't know if i ever looked at the yeah so i never looked at that glimmering one okay cool yeah i was gonna say i should uh take a look at that investigate it
Cletus Cobbington 02:49:32 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:49:44 That was the map. Yeah. And I'll have it written down somewhere if it's a special thing. Ooh, thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:50:04 It was in session 29. Yeah. And then session 30 is when I found that other one, the map.
Dungeon Master 02:50:16 The source thing is great. Okay. Still give me a chance to figure it out. It was all I have are the notes that you were in a certain area. So I'll have to look at the loot table for the area. And sometimes it just says like glimmering scroll and it doesn't actually say what it is. So I might have to make it into something.
Leopold Magnus 02:50:44 Okay. Cool. Nice. And I did update the notebook LM with all the transcripts. So if you guys want to search up things, you can find it. I think you're all invited.
Dungeon Master 02:50:47 But we'll get that sorted for next time. Yeah, it doesn't say specifically. I didn't write it down. Okay. I'll figure that out. Nice. I also have been doing that.
Cyrus Schwert 02:51:19 Let me use that much yet. It looks cool. When you showed me
Dungeon Master 02:51:22 It's pretty cool. Oh, yeah. I use it all the time. And in fact, I've been uploading most of the summaries as individual sources up until in the mid-20s.
Cletus Cobbington 02:51:24 you you
Leopold Magnus 02:51:25 Yeah, you should definitely check it out. I think if you're not added, I will... I thought I did add you, though, Jonathan, didn't I? Maybe not. Hmm.
Zariel Torgan 02:51:40 if you don't feel
Dungeon Master 02:51:52 Just because I really like that you can do it. And in it, in the Notebook LM, is the enchanting guide. So if you guys ever want to know how long you have left, it's one of the sources. Right.
Leopold Magnus 02:51:59 Okay. I'm adding you to the direct like the pure just session transcript source. So this is like, if you need to find like the ground truth, because if those other ones are the summaries, they're probably mostly right, but they could be slightly off if the summary didn't work properly.
Dungeon Master 02:52:26 But I think I also have that one too. I think you've given me access to everything. But anyway, yeah, we'll call it there for the night. You guys get your long rest. I was thinking about leveling you up, but I think we'll do it after whatever encounter comes next.
Leopold Magnus 02:52:30 Nice. What? Yeah, let's do that. And then Travis and Trace, if you put your email in the chat, I'll add you to the notebook because I don't see you on there.
Cyrus Schwert 02:52:44 Okay. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:52:45 Sweet.
Cletus Cobbington 02:52:47 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:52:56 Rex, will you drop a link to that?
Dungeon Master 02:52:57 I'm

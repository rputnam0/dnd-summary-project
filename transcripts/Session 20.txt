Dungeon Master 00:00:00 region. Holy shit, Greg Bux. You guys are in this beautifully sunny amber fields, mostly wheat is grown, and so it's got a very golden sort of run of the whole thing. But in this very specific area, it is not wheat or grains that are grown, it is a different kind of farm.
Kaladen Shash 00:00:05 The break is late.
Cletus Cobbington 00:00:07 Silence. Silence.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:09 big dude on campus.
Dungeon Master 00:00:26 In the early morning hours, you hear a rooster crowing in the back, sort of breaking through the window. You stretch your big, lumbering arms, and what does Cletus do first thing each morning?
Cletus Cobbington 00:00:41 My little squirrel goes and gets me a big old mug of lukewarm almond milk.
Dungeon Master 00:00:59 And then Travis, if you wouldn't mind, how does Chip sound only to Cletus? I don't hear him at all. He's silent. Okay, he's back. Yeah, you might have stepped away when I said it, but I was like, no, fucking NADDPOD style. Travis is going to continue to voice Chip.
Cletus Cobbington 00:01:12 You're muted, Bird. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:01:13 Haha.
Cyrus Schwert 00:01:15 Okay, I can do that. I have to voice chip. I have to do actual words. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:01:39 He throws a little bit of a fit as he sort of campers out of the window down the tree branch to sort of cut back into the bottom level of your sort of windmill sort of farmhouse in the basement. You've got your stores of almond milk. And you go to work your fields as a almond farmer. Almond milk farmer, I should say very specifically.
Cletus Cobbington 00:01:59 Yes. Very respectful.
Dungeon Master 00:02:06 You drink your hot steaming cup of almond milk as you sort of go out the door. And already working hard as your sort of recent hire farmhand, there's another lanky, tall individual struggling to take a bucket of water, I guess is what you'd be feeding your crops. He's sort of loading it up onto a cart as they see this other figure.
Kaladen Shash 00:02:27 Really.
Dungeon Master 00:02:33 Travis, if you care to introduce what they see from the back.
Cyrus Schwert 00:02:38 From the back, big ol' juice on skin. You see a skinny little half-elf, lithe and gaunt, in too clean of clothes for working on a farm. And I'm really grunting and moaning as I'm trying to drag this bucket of water over to the field. It's, oh, please.
Cyrus Schwert 00:03:07 S-sir, cleaners, can I have a break? I've already been working for 15 minutes. Yes, we... I'm not made for this work. I'm trying my best.
Cletus Cobbington 00:03:16 Cyrus, don't you understand that Chip does more work than you in 15 minutes than you do in the whole day? Why the f*** did I hire you? What the f***? If I didn't owe your father a favor, I'd be in much better shape.
Dungeon Master 00:03:36 And as Cletus sort of rubs his brows, what does Cletus look like?
Cletus Cobbington 00:03:43 Oh, Cletus is, uh, let's see. He's a big hulking furbolg, kind of cow-like giant. He wears overalls that are way too dirty. He has for sure not cleaned them in a long time. Strong contrast to his employee Cyrus's clothes. Always got a piece of wheat, little straw coming out of the mouth.
Cletus Cobbington 00:04:09 Big old straw hat, and then I got a cute little rabid score along my shoulder named Chip. He's a cute guy.
Dungeon Master 00:04:19 An interesting point that you probably didn't even know is you weren't always sort of a cow-like looking creature. You were born with this inherent curse that eventually manifested with your affinity for animals. One day you started feeling like you had some drawn nature power, and you started to use it a little bit. And after you had sort of experimented with it too much, your whole body got covered with hair.
Dungeon Master 00:04:47 And you sort of grew a little bit of like a snouted face your hands got a little more like and it's weird but it's not uncommon that the curse that affects a large portion of this city. Is well known so event you occasionally you see people who are like.
Cletus Cobbington 00:04:47 or not.
Dungeon Master 00:05:05 totally disfigured and stuff. And it's, it's like, oh, shit, that's bad for them. But they're not dangerous, necessarily. And then sometimes they are dangerous. And like, people have to be taken out when they transform. But you're well known in your community as being just like a guy who got too close to nature, and your body transformed.
Cletus Cobbington 00:05:24 I remember just like it was yesterday, I was like, Chip, move! Right? Right? Jesus Christ. Gotta get used to that.
Cyrus Schwert 00:05:32 I'd like to see you carry this fuckin' water. Don't have fuckin' hooves for hands. Good luck!
Dungeon Master 00:05:41 In Morty vibes. Um, when you guys work through your morning and at lunch, you take a break and you head into you sell all of your
Dungeon Master 00:05:55 like goods in the market district, but you do it through Cyrus's father, who is a vendor, sort of like organizer in the Sweets District. So you have connections through three of the districts, which is the only reason you sort of travel to and from. It's not super common to do that. But it makes sense that you sell your goods at the market district.
Dungeon Master 00:06:15 Sort of late noon, you've got everything, you've traveled, it takes quite a bit of time to get from one end of the city to the other. So sort of like a couple hours walk with your cart, you make it to the market district.
Dungeon Master 00:06:28 And you see a lot of people are sort of like rustling and bustling past you, like rushing, shoulder checking, but they don't seem angry. They almost seem panicked, but nobody's like screaming. It's just like, if you watch a movie, you can tell something's about to happen kind of scene, where like the protagonist looks ahead where everybody's running from kind of deal. But as you guys are sort of wheeling your cart in, you notice a lot of people are sort of running the other direction.
Cletus Cobbington 00:06:54 Hmm. Notice I'm pushing the cart. Cyrus is on the cart.
Cyrus Schwert 00:06:55 Are you sure we should keep going? It looks like everyone else feels like I feel today. Everyone's nervous and jumpy. It's kind of nice. Thanks, Chip. Mr. Monk. Should we be going in here? What do you think's going on?
Dungeon Master 00:07:06 Chip lays a little paw on your thigh.
Cletus Cobbington 00:07:22 Well, we got bills to pay. I got almond wine to sell, almond milk to sell, almonds to sell. Like, what are we doing? We got to make ends meet here. No, up to it. Let's go. I continue on.
Cyrus Schwert 00:07:40 Hey.
Dungeon Master 00:07:43 You keep going in, you're sort of pushing back, and you notice that eventually you do hear a blood-curdling scream. It's jarring, it's so fast. You see people are sprinting at this point, running, and people are trampled and falling over, and people are ducking.
Dungeon Master 00:08:00 sideways and alleyways and you're like what the fuck just going on and you see this large woven creature bust through the side of the dome through what everybody knows is called like the arcane splitter it's if you have this solid wall of magic it was this device that was installed that can sort of split the wall open for people to go through and the first time it was opened there is this attack that happened and part of that was this large were and that's sort of what happened previously but you see
Dungeon Master 00:08:29 The wall sort of flickers and starts to break almost like glass going up about 10-15 feet. And you hear this large blood curdling howl as a bunch of wolves start swarming into the city. And it's like instant mayhem. It's like World War Z, you guys are Brad Pitt, sort of ducking and moving and hitting the side. And it goes crazy. And to sort of,
Dungeon Master 00:08:56 Give a little bit of a meta thing for a second. This is a few days prior to when Leo Deers had left. They're not anybody you know, but they, no, this is a few days after, sorry. This is, they have left and then something happened, but you guys then start to proceed for like the rest of the day, you hide out at the farm and then you hear like,
Cletus Cobbington 00:09:03 you.
Dungeon Master 00:09:20 sirens go off like nuclear holocaust kind of horns blaring. And then as you guys are looking through like your boarded up house, you see these soldiers you've never seen before in all black armor, totally emotionless sort of hurting people out.
Dungeon Master 00:09:36 and you guys make a run for the Emerald District because it's mostly forest, and you know that to be a safe place. But as you get there, you run into some people who say they work for the Corps, and they're trying to teleport out of the city. They know of something, this very lithe, half-orc-looking figure. He talks to you with sort of an Irish accent, and he's just getting people together to get them out of the city because shit's going down, but he doesn't really explain what's going on.
Dungeon Master 00:10:06 What you guys are all sort of hurting into this room and. You can look at you when he's any says very specifically he's like i need you to find my friends. And so he puts in these things specifically and you guys are teleport busy give you any contacts there's nothing else but.
Dungeon Master 00:10:23 The big thing is is you've never been out of the dome before that's that's like blasphemous it's like wasteland apocalyptic monsters you're safe in the dome kind of propaganda. So for him to just grab you throw you in this teleporter and teleport you away is like the most jarring shit that happened to your whole day you.
Cletus Cobbington 00:10:36 you
Dungeon Master 00:10:43 feel this sensation of your entire body stretching, and like a snap rubber band when your feet come up, you are instantaneously on this soft moss ground bed, deep in this forest. Sun sort of peeking through the canopy, you're looking around, you don't hear anything but like some birds in the distance sort of chirping back and forth to each other.
Dungeon Master 00:11:08 And you guys take a second, you have your freak out, and eventually you just start walking. You don't know where. You try to find water. You've got basic survival instincts. Derry being a farmer knows how to sort of work the land. He's like fashioning some sticks and some spits for cooking, and he's like planning on camping out the night. Cyrus is maybe not handling it as well. But...
Cletus Cobbington 00:11:32 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:11:34 No way. What?
Dungeon Master 00:11:34 on after your first night of sleeping and you guys are in your camp, you hear this voice sort of present itself in your head. This warm feeling kind of fills you and you get this imagery of this sort of worn down ruins, but the feeling you get from it is warm, comfort and safety. It feels like the place to go. And so you almost have an innate sense of direction as you were drawn to one central location.
Dungeon Master 00:12:03 And we'll pivot from there to the party of the Odirs, who have had this really atrocious dungeon crawl so far, and we ended it with you guys finishing this fight in this brine pool.
Dungeon Master 00:12:22 where you've just killed these alien brain tentacle creatures that you have no idea. You have Wesley, who is sort of the rabbit folk guy in your party, and you just saved his friend named Tucker, who is a sort of Kenku bird sorcerer, who sort of speaks in broken words that you can tell he's learned from other people. He's mostly vocal at this point, but some of his sentences are a little short, and
Dungeon Master 00:12:51 When you guys, the last thing we had happened with the party is you had decided that after this fight, you were going to leave. And that's right where we sort of cut it off right then. So when we pick it up right now, the first thing that's going to happen is Tucker sort of looks to you guys, and in his broken words, he's like, Wesley, don't abandon, and then in a different voice, he says, Herb and Darwin.
Dungeon Master 00:13:20 And he sort of stamps his little crow foot on the ground and points to, like, down the hallway you haven't explored yet, very frustratingly. And Wesley goes, well, no, don't don't think we're giving up on them yet. It's these these folks thinks there's another way. And.
Dungeon Master 00:13:40 He's gonna, you see Tucker's a little resistant to just leaving the friends just because it's not uncommon. And I believe it was Leopold who would uncover that Tucker has been infected with a mind flare parasite. You don't know what that means, but you were gonna kill him. And then Wesley kind of talked you out of it. So what would you guys like to do as you want to leave? Tucker has made it known that he wants to rescue the two other party members.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:11 Jonathan, are they all speaking common or are they speaking Sylvan? Okay. Yeah, I'm just, Leopold's just hanging out. Right, right. What were you saying, Brent?
Kaladen Shash 00:14:11 Did we see? Did we see the other two friends? Oh, I was asking if we saw the other two friends in the pods.
Dungeon Master 00:14:16 Remember, they're speaking Sylvan, so two of the people can understand it. But you guys do have your telepathic bond right now, so it gets sort of relayed to you through them. What was Kaladin's question? Not in this room. There was only one figure in this room, but
Zariel Torgan 00:14:30 Real quick, we weren't talking about leaving and leaving for good. We were talking about going and finding that helmet, right?
Kaladen Shash 00:14:40 Is that where we located them? And so there's still one friend on the counter for. OK. Artifact yeah. Right, but it's not a different part of the room. This ruined city.
Dungeon Master 00:14:48 There's two. Yeah. Yeah, that is correct. You know that this bird folk doesn't know that. You guys saw that through, like, an underwater mural kind of deal that was drawn in blood very hastily done. Like, that was secret knowledge you got from a perception check.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:06 So, do I know Sylvan? I think I do. Hang on. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:15:19 Right. I think you do. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:15:24 Yeah, it was you, I can understand.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:31 I guess I'll just, I'll just recap above table before I start just talking about stuff that we decided on. We decided as a group, the three of us, like we're going to go get this thing and come back, right? Like we already came to that conclusion. Okay. Then yeah, I'll just say, well, we not leaving for good, but.
Kaladen Shash 00:15:45 I think it's going to help us to defeat this little mind player group, we know that.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:49 Yeah, that was the idea. Circle back, check it out, see if we can get some benefit from it, and then keep going.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:01 I don't know if you noticed, probably none of you, because you were in a tune, but our friends here were affected. We think there might be something back the way we came that would help us out. Have our word. I'll give a little nod.
Dungeon Master 00:16:16 He sort of warbles a little bit under his breath and then in like his broken sylvan he goes, and you promise come back? He sticks out his little bird hand, sort of take it on you.
Kaladen Shash 00:16:22 No. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:36 I'll put my metal hand out and I'll shake it. We long rest. OK, that's what it was. So. I'll just I'll relate to Leo, what's what's going on that he's just, you know, resident reticent to leave this
Dungeon Master 00:16:43 Not yet. You short rested before, I believe, this fight. You had this fight. I don't think you've short rested after.
Leopold Magnus 00:16:51 Well, gents, what's this big bird squawking about, anyhow? Well, I do say he should just tag along. He doesn't have much for this world.
Kaladen Shash 00:17:13 Yep.
Dungeon Master 00:17:13 Okay, and then you guys turn around, you leave the dungeon, you don't get hassled at all on your way out, because you've cleared the path through here. And eventually you get to the spot that had like the water tunnel that you swam down and back up through the top and it was like a different building. And then you walk through there. And eventually, as you guys are approaching the door, I want somebody from Travis and traces group to roll a d 20. And somebody from the odiers to roll a d 20.
Kaladen Shash 00:17:46 Did you just create 20? Mine's falling, let's see. Create team.
Dungeon Master 00:17:47 Just a D20. 18.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:49 Yeah I get it Caledon.
Cyrus Schwert 00:17:53 We got an 11.
Dungeon Master 00:18:05 Cyrus and Cletus, you go to open this door and as you sort of put your hand on like the engraved outcrop that you can pull on it with, the door opens and you tumble back where it's asked for a tea kettle and you see stepping out of this supposedly abandoned building,
Dungeon Master 00:18:23 three omen nights which are like think of it as like the FBI sort of SWAT team that like comes in after the cops can't do something like their elite sort of level of policing force and next to them is a like rabbit sort of folk and a walking raven. They're like each four and a half feet tall. Never seen anything like that.
Cletus Cobbington 00:18:27 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:18:46 But you open the door and you're like, what the? Like it all happens at once and you guys are sitting, you on the ground on your butts looking up at these figures. And what do they see? We'll go Kaladin, Leopold, Zario in that order. What are the figures they see as they step out?
Kaladen Shash 00:19:06 Um, first you'll see very, very tall, 100% elf coming through with half plates of red dragon scale, looking magnificent. Yeah. I think right now I've got light splitter, my current, yeah, I've got a wooden arm from my prosthetic potion. It's, it was like a baby Groot arm, it's coming in now, so.
Dungeon Master 00:19:24 His arm is wooden. Yeah, you guys think enough Dave that it, remember he rolled like six natural ones in a row on how much it grew. So he like kept, it only kept growing by the smallest amount.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:35 Is it full-sized? Great, yeah. That's hilarious.
Kaladen Shash 00:19:37 It's full-sized. I want to get it stronger. Horrible. Horrible.
Cletus Cobbington 00:19:48 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:19:51 He's got this sword sort of in his hand or on his back that is the handle, and in the air floating are pieces of like stained glass that are separated but sort of fixed in place, all of different colors. Beautiful blade. And next to him is this tall, armored knight that looks to not be real. Leopold, what does you look like? What is your character?
Leopold Magnus 00:20:16 Yeah, so we came through the doorway, right? Leopold kind of comes through banging his head on the top of the doorframe, being quite tall and not necessarily well imposed in his movements, and kind of spins around
Dungeon Master 00:20:21 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:20:38 from from being banged, his head spins around and looks at you, too. And he goes, oh, oh, who are these two? And you see a large metal suit of armor with a helm behind it. You don't see any face or any any anything, really. You just see this violet light coming through.
Leopold Magnus 00:21:01 and a voice kind of echoing from the inside of the armor. You'll see gears and steam pistons are kind of keeping the arms and legs moving. And behind me comes a second set of armor, but more robotic and stiff in its movements. And it walks up and it goes, are these enemies of Leopold?
Leopold Magnus 00:21:30 And I kind of, Leopold holds up Bone Crusher, my armored suit back. That's what you see.
Dungeon Master 00:21:42 Yeah, a robot with a robot is the second character. Figured that out. And then the third person sort of filtering out, sort of with his hands up, sort of to catch Leopold if he fell after hitting his head, is another sort of metallic figure. What does Zario look like, Jesse?
Kaladen Shash 00:21:50 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:06 what everybody expects a third robot walks out and he's a little more humanoid looking rather than having like vacant spaces with like magical energy for the eyes and for the insides it's more of like an Ultron from like Age of Ultron style robot and a little more elegantly made doesn't look like he's quite as powerful as Leo but
Cyrus Schwert 00:22:11 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:22:27 you
Zariel Torgan 00:22:33 seems to be a little more, maybe a little more intricate in specific spots. It's got like this iridescent greenish purplish energy that kind of emanates from different seams and spots in the body. And yeah, just like a whale. Can I make a perception check to see if they seem harmful? All right, yeah, I just want to like,
Dungeon Master 00:22:58 Yeah, go ahead and give me a perception check. Clegis and Cyrus, give me either persuasion or deception checks. Yeah. Yeah, they're both wisdom-based, but you might be proficient in one and not the other.
Cletus Cobbington 00:23:07 From both of us. Got an 11.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:11 Should that have been insight instead of perception? All right. No, it's the same for both, so 15.
Dungeon Master 00:23:30 15 versus 11. Cletus, are you threatening? Are you dangerous to these people? His voice kind of vibrates a little bit.
Cletus Cobbington 00:23:39 I'm just an innocent almond milk farmer. I just see some folk, and I can always pitch some almond milk if all else fails. And I got Cyrus. He's shaking his boots. He's not intimidated. Tip growls really loud, though.
Cyrus Schwert 00:23:49 I would never be violent to the part of the Omen Knights. I'm quaking. I'm quivering.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:56 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:24:01 You see this little squirrel pops up onto Cleetus, I almost said Derry, onto Cleetus' shoulder and he's like... And he sort of holds up his fist and you see his little squirrel knuckle crack as he flexes it. He seems a little harmful. He sort of brushes the sweat off his forehead.
Cletus Cobbington 00:24:09 I gave him a little almond and he calmed down.
Kaladen Shash 00:24:21 You do that.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:27 Well, I'll put a hand on Leo's shoulder, just be like, oh, these guys are friends. Then kind of look at them, and based on how they notice us as some sort of authority, I would be like, well, you guys, you guys are a long way from home, aren't you? Well.
Cyrus Schwert 00:24:28 What are you doing here? Are you the nice voice in my head? Someone's been really nice to me and it's been the only thing getting me through the days.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:58 Unfortunately, I think that might be a big brain. Well, shit, sorry, it might be, it might be something, something, shit, right? I don't know what it is. Sorry, that might be something else. That might be something that we, it's a bad thing, but it's okay, because we're gonna be, we're gonna be taking care of it. Sorry about that.
Cletus Cobbington 00:24:58 Anybody want some almond milk?
Dungeon Master 00:25:04 You don't know what it is. He just has his hand down and put some almond milk in it.
Cyrus Schwert 00:25:11 Right. That's a fair question. That's a fair question.
Kaladen Shash 00:25:26 What are you doing here? You're from the dome, yes?
Zariel Torgan 00:25:32 Jesus.
Leopold Magnus 00:25:35 Well, I'll take some. Thank you very much. Leopold is 6'11". 450 pounds. You just see the... Oh, damn.
Cletus Cobbington 00:25:37 Take this. Here, one for everybody. I just have them way too fast and ready. I have to look so I can be accurate. I'm eight foot tall. I'm a little hunchback. I'm a little hunchback.
Dungeon Master 00:25:40 How tall is Cletus and how tall is Leopold? Cletus is eight feet tall.
Cyrus Schwert 00:25:41 It's really warm. They're really warm.
Cletus Cobbington 00:26:07 though, so I look 7-6.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:09 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:26:10 That's crazy. You just see Leopold's head slide back. That's right. But the almond milk starts going down. It just splashes into the chest cavity, and you kind of see it leaking out in between all the cracks of the armor.
Kaladen Shash 00:26:10 Oh, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:26:12 Here, this is the second person you've ever met that's taller than you. The first one is the Lord Marshal, who is like an enormous figure. Cleus is over a head taller than the Lord Marshal.
Cletus Cobbington 00:26:38 Oh shit, that can't be good. I offer some almond paste to seal the cracks. Oh, huh. See something new every day. Cyrus, you should learn from this guy.
Cyrus Schwert 00:26:38 That's gonna stink. That is gonna stink. To answer your question, if you'd like to know the answer,
Dungeon Master 00:26:41 You get a little whiff of rotisserie chicken, too, somehow. Doesn't apply specifically. Not specifically.
Leopold Magnus 00:26:44 Yeah. Oh, yes, of course. And I just throw that in my chest cavity as well.
Kaladen Shash 00:26:48 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:27:06 what we're doing out here we're outside of the city because we were going to sell the almonds at the market district and then they just the wall cracked open and a bunch of wolves came in and they were attacking people going crazy i don't know if you've read the play world war z with brad pitt but it was like that with wolves and we got the hell out of there we teleported and now we're just here and i heard a nice voice so i followed it because
Cyrus Schwert 00:27:35 I just needed something a little nice for the world to look forward to. I'm a little scared. What are you doing here? Did the same thing happen to you? Great adventures!
Zariel Torgan 00:27:44 Yeah, it's crucial.
Kaladen Shash 00:27:49 We're on a mission. No. We chose this. We're heroes. He heard a nice voice as well. It was dangerous. Don't listen to it.
Cletus Cobbington 00:27:54 Keep sitting her up to.
Leopold Magnus 00:28:00 Well, to be honest, maybe they are. I'm just here to have some company. And we came along and my friend Zariel started wandering off into this direction. And well, that's how we ended up here.
Dungeon Master 00:28:01 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:19 Yeah, we don't know what it is. Well, boys. You find yourselves out here. Are you proficient in anything other than slinging almonds? Because where we're going, it's going to be a bit dangerous.
Cyrus Schwert 00:28:22 Nothing in the world is good. Everything's falling apart. And I'm kinda nasty with a sword.
Cletus Cobbington 00:28:27 Cyrus's worst nightmare, another voice. I'm proficient in three things.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:48 You fend for yourselves or you can be a lot. It's inside check. Sex.
Cyrus Schwert 00:28:54 That is sick with it. More than that. 21,000.
Dungeon Master 00:29:00 Give me this I check to see if he is nasty with it and Travis don't tell them if you don't want to but deception or performance. 26. Oh, what do you get?
Cletus Cobbington 00:29:11 you
Kaladen Shash 00:29:19 You can now.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:24 Do I believe him?
Cyrus Schwert 00:29:28 Oh, I keep rolling real dice. Uh, 21.
Dungeon Master 00:29:34 Zaryl, you look at this, like, sort of, I mean, no offense, but wimpy, disheveled, extinguished form of a man, and you look and you're like, wait, hold on. And then he's just like, the way his hand goes and grabs his sword, you instantly feel like the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:56 All right. My little robot hair is laid back down. Interesting. All right. And what about you? Look at, go ahead.
Dungeon Master 00:30:00 and like in an anime moment you jump 60 feet backwards sweating as you can tell that he's dangerous
Kaladen Shash 00:30:07 Bye.
Cletus Cobbington 00:30:23 I put a handout, Cletus, Cletus Covington. And then, I'm interested in three things, almonds obviously, two, animals, and three, bossing this little shit Cyrus around, okay? But he is nasty with a sword, but miserable in baling hay.
Cyrus Schwert 00:30:25 Honestly, almonds. Not really hard, all that good.
Zariel Torgan 00:30:34 All right, well, you guys can not be a liability then suppose
Dungeon Master 00:30:39 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:03 Would you mind if the three of us were here, took a second and had a bit of a private conversation? Well, what do you guys think?
Cletus Cobbington 00:31:13 Tour. Bye.
Cyrus Schwert 00:31:14 Oh, that's fine. That's fine.
Dungeon Master 00:31:16 You guys go three feet away and somehow they can't hear you. What are you guys talking about?
Kaladen Shash 00:31:20 Sounds like the dome has been attacked. When did you show up here? Did someone send them to us?
Zariel Torgan 00:31:32 Yeah, it hurt though. It would seem to me that the odds of them just showing up here where we are would be astronomical. I am a bit skeptical. However, if they're lying, they're the best I've ever seen. They'd seem to not know why. What do you say?
Kaladen Shash 00:31:56 OK, I believe you, my friend. Let's look for the cap. I'm not babysitting, though. I'm just waiting for his turn, waiting to jump in.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:03 get a little more information while we're looking for that little cap. Absolutely. They end up. Rex, are you muted? Oh, OK. I just wanted to make sure I was. Yes. Oh, no. Well, what do you think, Leo?
Leopold Magnus 00:32:18 Oh, no, sorry. Yeah, I didn't want to interrupt anyone. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:32:29 Well, um, to be honest, these guys seem pretty young and strapping and, you know, I suppose we could use some help around here. Uh, but he said he's pretty bad at bailing hay. So I, you know, I mean, hopefully we don't come across much of that around here having so far. And he just keeps, you know, aimlessly muttering random stuff to himself.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:36 I think we can agree if they become a liability, we can always send them on packing. But in the meantime, maybe we'll see how they
Dungeon Master 00:32:40 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:33:00 I'm sorry, my friend, is this a euphemism for something else? What do you mean send him packing? A good solution for everything. Yes, you're right.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:11 Maybe. And yeah, we'll see how they do. All right. Well, Leo, do you want to welcome them to the group temporarily? You're very good with words.
Cletus Cobbington 00:33:28 Much obliged.
Leopold Magnus 00:33:32 Well, um, welcome to the Odears. Um, as long as you are staying behind Bone Crusher and these two strapping, uh, fellas here, there's nothing to worry about. Um, I wouldn't count on myself as a, you know, I'm not very good in combat, but I'm, I'm trying. So, uh, yes. Welcome. We're happy to have you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:33:56 I'm an adventurer now? I'm an adventurer! I'm brave! I'm brave and strong. This is the best day of my life. I start weeping. It's obviously tears of joy.
Dungeon Master 00:34:05 And we'll say important.
Cletus Cobbington 00:34:12 Wow, I've never seen him smile.
Zariel Torgan 00:34:15 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:34:15 How old does he look? How old does this little half-elf look? Okay. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:34:22 Oh god. What in half-elf years? If it was a human, he would be like 30. A young-ish adult.
Dungeon Master 00:34:35 of the lore also. The reason why he's asking is, in this world, you guys are like, again, all of these species were trapped under a dome for a thousand years or so, whatever. So everything is blended into one race called the Anduvan. Just basically think of it as like, everybody looks mostly human, and the subtle differences are what give you your uniqueness. So the fact that Kaladin looks like a full elf is mind boggling. He looks like the most pureblood elf in the entire city.
Dungeon Master 00:35:03 Cyrus has enough half-elf in him, Kaladin, that when you look at him, you're like, his family is probably of some sort of import to keep like a bloodline relatively purish. It's got a little muddled. He's not full elf, but like he's got point to his ears. He looks very fair in appearance. So the fact that you both in the same party is kind of odd. And then you guys, you see Cletus and it's like, this is a cow man. You can tell instantly that he's cursed.
Kaladen Shash 00:35:17 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:35:34 More of a blessing in my work, but whatever.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:42 So would we get the impression this is a guy that just likes, he likes cows so much he just turned into a cow?
Kaladen Shash 00:35:49 That's how his purse manifested. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:35:49 I mean, you need abilities, but you know that when you were at the combat trials to join the Legionnaire, that one guy who had a fire and affinity was using it so angrily that he turned into a fire elemental. When you look at him, I think it'd be like an easy A, B equals C logic stuff to be like, he uses nature based something and whatever he did enough of transformed him into this. The specifics would be up to trace of what happened to him, but.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:15 I think that's what it was. I'm a big Marvel fan.
Dungeon Master 00:36:19 He didn't have to think about that before. That's new.
Leopold Magnus 00:36:23 Well, by that logic, Zario, you must've just really liked toy soldiers.
Cyrus Schwert 00:36:31 Absolutely got him. Sick bird, sir.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:42 Jonathan, do we have like a pretty good idea of where to start looking for that cap, for that like helm?
Dungeon Master 00:36:51 Yeah, if you guys remember, this is what you guys had established. And this is not me giving anything. This is like your guys's discussion last time, as it comes back to me. You when you first got to this area, again, it's like this huge sort of abandoned village slash temple of like broken down stones. And it almost looks like there's a like fingers coming out of the ground of stone. There's like old broken down buildings, sort of the imagery of it. You had seen two separate doors that looked more functional than others.
Cletus Cobbington 00:37:11 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:37:20 You went in the one on the right. When you were down in the water and you saw that thing and then you guys had the conversation later, you're like, let's go to the other one and see what's in there.
Zariel Torgan 00:37:35 Yeah, so we got a pretty good idea of where to head. What do you guys think? Do you wanna just, I mean, do you just wanna start cooking or just jump into it? Oh, yeah. Let's see. I used very little, either that or at some point,
Kaladen Shash 00:37:39 Yeah. I'll be honest, I. My my spell slots might be OK, but. I'm hurt right now. I'm at 36.
Leopold Magnus 00:37:54 You dinged up.
Zariel Torgan 00:38:05 I did a simulation. Yeah, I've only used one first level, one second level, and one third level, and none of my fourth levels. And I'm at full health. But I mean, we can take a break if you want to take another short rest or something. All right.
Dungeon Master 00:38:05 You did your conjure animal thing or whatever it was and you relied mostly on the wolves.
Kaladen Shash 00:38:27 Yeah, I think that should be okay. I didn't use all my, I don't think I used all my dice. I should be okay with that.
Leopold Magnus 00:38:27 Yeah, we can take a short rest. Yeah, let's do it. I actually have hit Asus while I can pop up.
Zariel Torgan 00:38:35 Leo, you want to rest? All right, sweet. I think, well, we'll take a second here. I mean, maybe I'll take this time to talk to my shield and see if I can convince it about these weird things that we thought
Dungeon Master 00:38:40 Silence.
Cyrus Schwert 00:38:51 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:38:59 Mm-hmm. Tell it how glorious you were. Tell no lies. I don't know. I love this. I'll roll while I'm listening to you.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:09 All right, so it's a 10 persuasion if truthful. So I'm going to, unless somebody else has something they want to do for the short rest. All right, I'm going to pull out the shield and turn it around so it's facing me like a mirror. And I'm going to be like shield.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:32 We fought these scary tentacle monsters. And we actually kicked some pretty good ass. And it was pretty sweet. And we're probably going to have to do it again. So if you could just believe me and help me not get hit, that would be very helpful.
Dungeon Master 00:40:01 Hey, someone give me that roll. I have it slow. Is that fail number two or fail number one? OK.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:03 It's a minus one. God dammit. The shield's just like, bullshit. It's fail number two. God dammit. I don't have anything in it!
Leopold Magnus 00:40:10 Yikes.
Kaladen Shash 00:40:11 Yeah, it's gonna wipe. It's OK, you've got nothing to lose now, like just throw. Throw it well, as I'm saying, so if you if you I guess you only land one point, you just lie to it again so you can restart. Does it make it harder moving forward? OK, so right now he's got nothing on it.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:33 I don't think so. Yeah, the first time I tried it was fighting those werewolves. No. Yeah. Yeah, it's made for like a bard. Anyway, that's that's it. I'm good.
Dungeon Master 00:40:34 If he just gets a bunch of stuff on it and he gets a third fail, the whole thing wipes. And you failed then too. OK.
Kaladen Shash 00:40:47 Great work though. Oh, I thought I thought he got one of them to work. Also, it's just in a regular plus one shield this whole time.
Dungeon Master 00:41:05 It's a random item you pulled, you know. As you guys all rest, so Kaladin, Leopold, Zariel, rolling hit dice, trying to talk to their shield, anything from Cletus or Cyrus in this sort of half hour to an hour that you're sort of chilling?
Cyrus Schwert 00:41:27 Um, Cyrus just pulls out a book, starts reading, nothing crazy, just taking a moment to respite after running from wolves for days.
Dungeon Master 00:41:43 Yeah, so they explain what happened to you, they explain what happened to themselves to the party of the O'Dears in this downtime too. So you guys don't know sort of the details underneath it, but from what he explains, a few days after you guys finished in that werewolf den, and like must have been the morning after you left, like the city was sieged. Somehow, something happened, werewolves got in, you don't know the details because they didn't know the details.
Dungeon Master 00:42:13 But they describe this figure that sort of shepherded them into a safe area and then forced them to teleport away. And the figure they described sounds a lot like Ratchet.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:30 Did he mention anything about his soft tissue, this figure?
Cyrus Schwert 00:42:35 I'm gonna say mostly Soft Tissues. It was Soft Tissues, it was... He was very proud of being an Oven Knight, that was clear. Seemed like it was new, it didn't seem like he'd been one forever. Yeah, weird name. He was just, you know, being a helpful standby, stander, standerby guy, whatever you call that. Just helping us out, just trying to get people out of there, it seemed.
Kaladen Shash 00:42:38 They send you for a reason.
Dungeon Master 00:42:44 Can you guys see these two figures? As you guys are having this conversation, you notice they look a little underprepared.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:06 Did he say anything to you?
Dungeon Master 00:43:14 have a lot of magical items. If you have extra stuff, you might think about sharing a little bit. If not, that's fine.
Cyrus Schwert 00:43:23 I just have, obviously, basic scimitar at my hip and a shield on my back. I'm in farming clothes. Oh, I do have a... I don't go anywhere without my breastplate because I'm really scared. And it's under my clothes, but it's so clear that I'm wearing it. It does not fit. It's like, how should you reach football pads under a jersey?
Zariel Torgan 00:43:38 Hello.
Dungeon Master 00:43:41 He's got, like, a long, fat bead on the base of it, and just a metal plate underneath. Chip sort of waves you away like he's trying to nap. He doesn't want to be shown off right now.
Cletus Cobbington 00:43:51 I just got a quarter staff that's basically just a real long stick and where there would be a really cool orb is just a little squirrel curled up in a bushel of tail. That's why it's curled up. He's done talking. All right.
Cyrus Schwert 00:44:05 A real strong.
Cletus Cobbington 00:44:18 I just pull out a little bushel of hay and make myself a pillow. curl on it.
Zariel Torgan 00:44:19 So,
Dungeon Master 00:44:31 Okay. Um, you guys take that downtime. You don't do a whole lot. Um, and then you get your short rest and not interrupted. Nothing comes out of the first engine. It is daylight. You don't know if that makes a difference, but it seems as though you're safer in the day. Um, I'll say maybe it's like afternoon at this point, one, two o'clock. It's not sunset yet, but you know that you can't stay outside forever.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:05 Yeah, let's go in, but I was just curious, did we ever, I know us out of game,
Dungeon Master 00:45:07 Oh, there you go. I didn't know what I was looking at. Anyway, so you guys, where do you want to go next? Back in? Next door? Away?
Cyrus Schwert 00:45:13 Uh,
Kaladen Shash 00:45:17 the lip, the next step.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:29 Or to metagame, we heard Ratchet say, go find my friends. Did we ever hear that from them? Or do we need to keep? Did you guys mention that I know that in the explanation you gave it was pretty short, but would that would you have mentioned that or even thought to mention it? Because if not, it's OK. I'm just curious.
Dungeon Master 00:45:38 if they told you.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:48 Bye.
Cyrus Schwert 00:45:51 Ratchet told us to go find his friends. Got it. Missed that part. But definitely would have said that for sure. Right. I missed that line. Yeah, we would have said that as we just read it, for sure.
Dungeon Master 00:45:55 As he pushed you through the teleporter to a very specific destination, the only thing he said was, go find my friends. And you're like, when you got teleported, you didn't see anybody around you.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:59 Well, no matter what, we're going to go into this dungeon right now. But we can decide once we wrap it up.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:29 what we want to do if we need to go back and give some aid or something. I did forget about that. Yeah, thousands of miles. Yeah, you're right. I totally forgot.
Kaladen Shash 00:46:34 Can anyone teleport? I cannot teleport. You teleport? You just say, go back. I mean, turn around and walk a month back to home? You're getting very good, my friend. Maybe I thought you could. Yeah, yeah. It's in that.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:56 I think I'm like level 10 before I get something like that. All right. Let's get in there.
Dungeon Master 00:47:03 Uh, okay. You guys prepare to go to this other dungeon. You see that Wesley and Tucker sort of clear their throat and they go, Wesley goes, if you don't mind, I'm going to, we're going to stay outside and sort of keep an eye on the other door. We'll let you know if something's coming on through. Um, and then he goes, Oh, and also like, uh,
Cyrus Schwert 00:47:03 You guys have levels? Good.
Dungeon Master 00:47:28 It's important that I keep an eye on Tucker in case he changes. I wouldn't want that to happen around you guys. And it's just very obvious that they don't want to go into another unnecessary fight sequence if it happens. They're like tired of getting the shit kicked out of them. So they're like, good luck on your own there.
Cyrus Schwert 00:47:45 You guys aren't together? I thought this was one big group. You fought a troll. I've been practicing on hay bales and you fought a troll. Crazy.
Zariel Torgan 00:47:51 And.
Dungeon Master 00:47:51 No, Wesley is. No, I met these these fuckers just like a day or a day ago. They were at the river fighting this large tag trollish creature. It was pretty intense. And then. And then Tucker sort of piped up and Tucker goes, yeah, don't know them. We're from Cottonwood. And you don't even know where that is. That's not a name you've ever heard of.
Kaladen Shash 00:47:54 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:48:21 Oh yeah, I know that place. It's pretty nice, that's what I hear in the stories. It's just across the river, you know.
Kaladen Shash 00:48:25 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:48:28 That's really true. Then you guys. Just across the break you go to this other dungeon and what you see is.
Cletus Cobbington 00:48:30 Just crossed the river, so I heard. What age? Just crossed the creek, you know what I'm saying?
Dungeon Master 00:48:48 This as you crack the door it opens into complete darkness a large descending staircase has not been used in many many years. Cobwebs old skin no natural light those of you with dark vision you it sort of hits the cusp of your sixty feet and you kind of see there's like a little bit of floor at the bottom of the stairs but as you sort of descend down.
Kaladen Shash 00:49:10 I've got 90 feet. I just assume everyone else can see. What do we see at the bottom of the stairs? Just another large opening, is there anything else?
Dungeon Master 00:49:13 90 feet, you can see the full bottom as you get there. You end up in this new undiscovered place.
Dungeon Master 00:49:38 It's as you get up, it's just it's like not even a large room. It's like maybe a six foot wide room, maybe by like 10 or so feet old worked stone cobbled in some places where it's broken apart, but I'm very untouched. And as you descend, once you get to the bottom, you would see that there is sort of like an inscription on the front facing wall of the stairs, but nothing else.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:49 Thank you all.
Leopold Magnus 00:50:05 What does the inscription say? No, I just kind of rubbed my fingers across it and I turned to Kelly and I say, what does it say here?
Dungeon Master 00:50:08 Do you read Sylvan? It says, Vault of the Wildfolk, trial chamber sequence, collect 10 keys to get
Kaladen Shash 00:50:11 What does the inscription say? Let's see what it says for me.
Dungeon Master 00:50:38 The item. And when you inspect it, this also looks pretty hastily scribbled on. Like this roommate, this place wasn't maybe used for this like it was the vault and then like they underneath it scribbled in this new stuff. Uh, but it says gather the 10 keys and there is a door at the bottom that is closed.
Kaladen Shash 00:51:06 All right, go ahead and relay that to Leopold. Sounds like you have a challenge in front of you. Make keys. Perhaps your tinkering will be handy.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:13 Can I just take a glance around the room, see if there's anything I see that would be relevant?
Leopold Magnus 00:51:20 Hmm, I suppose so. I guess the key will be to make it.
Dungeon Master 00:51:38 In this room again, no. So this is a pretty small space. Some of you is still like on the stairs because you can't all fit in the room at the one time. There's the inscription on the plaque on the wall and a door to the left that's closed and that's all you see. You figure that this is the ante room.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:45 Was there an ante room before we got here, or did we walk in and it's just bam? So we haven't seen a lobby where we might be able to solve puzzles and find keys. It's just bam here, 10 keys.
Dungeon Master 00:52:11 Not that you see yet. Just a door. Yeah, it's not locked, so that would take you if you're on the map from this space to this space.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:15 All right. And it's just a door. Can I try opening it?
Dungeon Master 00:52:43 And then on this room, you see another plaque that says, once you walk in, you see there's another door on the right corner. But on the wall next to that, there is another plaque that says, once you enter, you must prove your skill before leaving.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:52 What do you guys think?
Kaladen Shash 00:53:15 Sounds like we need to commit to this if we're going to get the artifact. I think partly work is allowed. We've come in this far. It doesn't say travel forward alone, you know?
Zariel Torgan 00:53:21 You think there's more than one of us can go at a time, or do you think it's like a singular type of deal? Absolutely. All right, let's do it. I'll go to push through the second door. Travis, I thought I heard you. I thought I saw you talking, but I can't hear you. Yeah, I can't hear you.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:54 I just wanted to let you know I wasn't ignoring you. I saw your mouth move, but I couldn't hear you. Bring the rabbit guy back. We lost him.
Dungeon Master 00:54:02 Get some dungeon music. He's dead. From the very top of the stairs, you just hear him. No, I'm really quite all right up here.
Leopold Magnus 00:54:20 Wesley, get down here.
Dungeon Master 00:54:32 It's really nice weather. I think it's like 65 with a little bit of wind chill. Yes.
Cyrus Schwert 00:54:36 Is it good now? I was asking if Letus and Cyrus had been filled in on like why we're here. It's like Ratchet told us to go find his friends, which it seems like we have. But like we're just kind of following you down here. What are we doing?
Kaladen Shash 00:54:38 Yeah. Yes, so we were drawn, we were drawn here initially because of what Dariel was feeling, which turned out to be the same thing you were feeling.
Cletus Cobbington 00:54:38 There you go.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:38 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:55:07 Then we found this community of brain eaters. I don't know how to say it. First time I've ever seen this in my life. And now because we helped Wesley and his friends, we committed to doing this, now we have to do what we say.
Cyrus Schwert 00:55:13 What? Yeah. You don't know. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:55:25 Work, work, work. And more specifically, there was a helmet of some kind that seemed like it would help somehow against these things. There was a depiction on the wall. So we're here to get Kaladin or Leo some sort of helmet.
Kaladen Shash 00:55:53 Once we get past that, we have greater mission. We'll talk more about it if we make it out.
Zariel Torgan 00:56:00 Absolutely. I don't know if you've heard from Craig Avdad many times. All right, so are we good to go into that next room?
Cyrus Schwert 00:56:01 What are you making? Oh my god. Greg, is that? It sounds like you broke the fourth wall to me, but that's okay. I don't know what that means.
Leopold Magnus 00:56:02 that is a big if we've been in some pretty hairy situations so
Cletus Cobbington 00:56:11 Uh.
Dungeon Master 00:56:29 You see that it's a flat wall. There doesn't seem to be any sort of door handle or anything on it. There's like this little gray slate and at the top of the slate there's like this little tiny nail that sticks out of it. Just the tiniest amount, almost like smaller than a thumbtack. But nothing, no other features, no seam, no hinges, no lock.
Zariel Torgan 00:56:30 Well, you.
Leopold Magnus 00:56:57 So it was just a thumbtack. I'm just going to take that thumbtack off, and I'm going to sketch a little key.
Dungeon Master 00:57:00 basically like a half a thumbtack, like a very tiny small metal poking surface, and then a like five by three gray slate underneath it. And this is like to the right of the completely featureless doorway. It's a tap. It's not like a, not like an actual tactical, it's like,
Zariel Torgan 00:57:00 like small.
Dungeon Master 00:57:26 If you took a piece of metal from the back and you hammered a nail through it, like it would make a little point that comes out of it, but it's like part of the surface.
Leopold Magnus 00:57:34 Got it, OK. Well, I think we best read on this slate somehow. That might get us somewhere. I look around the room.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:38 Well, the other drawing we saw was in blood. Maybe somebody with blood needs to poke that and write something. You guys?
Cyrus Schwert 00:58:00 What are you? Oh. Got it. That sounds like it's that's you, bud. There's no way I poked at that first. No way.
Dungeon Master 00:58:03 You see, Chip sort of nudges Cletus on, like, what is his neck, because he's standing on his shoulder. Like, uh, now you fucking go. Poke it, you see a little point of blood comes to the top of your finger.
Kaladen Shash 00:58:04 Are you?
Cletus Cobbington 00:58:04 All right, all right a little shaky poke it Now fuck Cyrus
Zariel Torgan 00:58:07 Got blood, right? How many hit points?
Cletus Cobbington 00:58:35 Take care of this. I scribe open Cessna in perfect cursive.
Cyrus Schwert 00:58:35 Oh, that's what was supposed to happen. I have band-aids, but only after. Should we write, like, open the door or something? Oh. Very legible.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:40 Early 2000. I'll just. Why.
Dungeon Master 00:58:52 Perfect cursive. You see the door sort of was a little translucent, as far as you can tell, Cletus. Everybody else, you don't see a difference. Cletus, you notice the wall changes, and you see Chip sort of looks, he gasps in his little squirrel way, and he takes his little paw, he pricks it, he puts his little paw on the slate, and then he sees it change too. You think you could walk through this doorway if you wanted to.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:06 I'll give you that.
Cletus Cobbington 00:59:22 I take a little step forward. The trick is right open sesame.
Dungeon Master 00:59:26 You guys see Cletus and Chip walk perfectly through a solid wall. You poke your finger. Do you touch it to the slab? Do you draw anything or write anything or you just put it on? You hear from the other wall.
Cyrus Schwert 00:59:28 I was. Home.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:33 Oh dear, where'd those two go?
Zariel Torgan 00:59:35 Celebrity gossip.
Kaladen Shash 00:59:36 I put my good hand up to the thing, poke my finger. Yeah, touch it to the slab. Does it begin to change just with the touch of blood?
Dungeon Master 01:00:04 You don't see anything changed just by poking yourself. If you just touch it, yes, you notice that as soon as your finger with the blood makes contact with the slab, like a little rush of magic hits the door and it goes a little translucent and you think you could walk through that.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:07 You can
Kaladen Shash 01:00:07 Did I touch the slab with just the blood? And look back at Zaria and Leopold and say, perhaps whatever makes you go will work.
Cletus Cobbington 01:00:09 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:37 Well, I don't see any coffee around here.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:37 As I see, could I just put my hand out as Kaladin pushes through what seems like a solid wall and just see if my hand follows with him or if it just touches the wall?
Cyrus Schwert 01:00:37 I follow suit as well. America runs on Duncan. Cyrus pokes and touches and then walks through with.
Dungeon Master 01:00:55 at the flat surface, you feel the coldness of the wall. As you're sort of feeling this flat wall, Cyrus walks on your left just straight through the door.
Cletus Cobbington 01:01:10 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:01:11 I'll take one of the articulating finger joints where there's a little bit of that translucent energy and just smack it on that thing and then touch the slate.
Cyrus Schwert 01:01:11 Goodbye!
Dungeon Master 01:01:32 touch the slate you see you prick one of like the more exposed areas and this little bit of like iridescent oilish fluid drips to your finger point you touch it to the slate and the door changes for you.
Zariel Torgan 01:01:45 All right, I'm going to wait to make sure Leo can also get through, because I don't know if we can get back. So I'll let him know. Leo, it worked for me, so give it a shot. And if it's good, we'll both go.
Leopold Magnus 01:01:48 What? I'm going to. OK, that sounds wonderful. I'll reach out with my medley bit of of armor and maybe just kind of like mar dent this little thumbtack and then and then try to try to do the same thing. Imagining it's not going to work.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:16 The public system.
Dungeon Master 01:02:17 You see that just like trying to mart or dent doesn't do anything. It almost looks like you need to like prick a vulnerable area.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:27 Hmm, sorry, I'm not sure. And I crackle my saber out. Maybe we just cut our way in.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:36 I'm gonna grab Leo's hand. I was like, give me one second. And I'll just try to do the same thing I did. Find like an articulating joint where there's no shielding and just try to stab it on the thing. See if I can get some oil or some sort of grease or some sort of something. And then press it.
Dungeon Master 01:02:52 Mm hmm. You find more like a more vulnerable to being like for fluid transportation and this his carapace and you poke and unlike yours, it's not like magical and super iridescent. Like you poke this spot and straight up like oil sort of comes out like lubricant fills onto like the tip of his thumb.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:08 He wants to be vloggers.
Leopold Magnus 01:03:11 Oh, Zario, you really fucked me up. And all of my fingers are collapsed except for my middle finger, and it's just stuck open. All the rest are really, uh, I can't quite control my hands anymore. And I'm smearing oil all over the place and flicking oil in Zario's face while holding my middle finger up.
Cletus Cobbington 01:03:18 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:03:19 Come on.
Dungeon Master 01:03:29 You flip it off and you flick it and a little bit of the oil hits the slate and the view changes for you too and you think you could walk through that door.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:38 We'll go through. Yeah, I was worried about that.
Leopold Magnus 01:03:39 Well, you really did the trick. I guess let's go.
Dungeon Master 01:03:48 Okay, you guys step through and you go to this empty room that has two different doors on it. You turn around and you don't see any exits to the way that you just came in. It's a solid flat surface, not even an indication of a doorway.
Cletus Cobbington 01:03:51 Can I leave a little trail of almonds?
Cyrus Schwert 01:04:06 Can I, like, mark the door somehow? Like, is there anything on the ground that I can just, like, put where we came through just to, like, mark where the spot is? Scrape an almond on the wall. That's an obvious choice.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:08 justice. Tell her.
Dungeon Master 01:04:19 Yeah, I mean, as a bard and an almond farmer, as a bard and an almond milk farmer, you have ways of like, you've got ink, like pen and stuff, and you also have an almond that you could scrape on the wall, that would work too. Okay, you have marked your exit.
Kaladen Shash 01:04:21 Bye-bye.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:35 I'll look to Kaladin.
Cletus Cobbington 01:04:37 almonds are much more resilient than you might expect.
Cyrus Schwert 01:04:38 here I write in the almond bits.
Dungeon Master 01:04:47 Which doorway would you like to go through? They look exactly the same.
Kaladen Shash 01:04:57 Do I see anything that looks different between the two or any inscriptions? And do these appear as though they... Is there like a mechanical handle on them? Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:05:07 Can I just look to see if I see any traps? Just like anything that looks weird.
Dungeon Master 01:05:17 Yep, these look like normal reinforced wood, stone, wood metal doors. Give me a perception check. 18th, you don't notice anything.
Zariel Torgan 01:05:38 before we start willy-nilly. 18. Looks all right. All right, I'll follow him.
Kaladen Shash 01:05:40 Yes, I will just confidently walk up to this door and say, we're going to this one.
Dungeon Master 01:06:00 You go down this way, you find that this opens up into yet another room, but you don't notice anything in this room at this time. There is a doorway going up, a doorway going left, and a doorway going right.
Zariel Torgan 01:06:09 I think the fact that he has a mask, of course, myself, but what he had, and Twitter, a lot of us have really, you know, abolished drugs.
Kaladen Shash 01:06:23 Do we see anything that looks like dirt's been disturbed or creatures moving? Yes, what do you see?
Dungeon Master 01:06:32 Give me a perception check. Anybody who wants to can. Okay, one natural to me. Cyrus cletus.
Zariel Torgan 01:06:36 Can I, yeah, I was gonna ask if I could participate. Natural 20.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:42 Nice. You just click on it.
Cletus Cobbington 01:06:55 Oh, I'll do it. I got a good one. Oh, here I did it. How do I, I don't know how to use this thing. Roll. Hang on.
Cyrus Schwert 01:07:05 Funny.
Dungeon Master 01:07:09 What do you mean use this thing? Like use this? Well, that's a six. But also, if you are on the main page and you hit the space bar, it'll pull up your character sheet. And you can roll using your stats and stuff. Well, perfect.
Kaladen Shash 01:07:14 There you go, Cletus. You can click any of that stuff, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:17 There you go. And then let's have a little box next to it. Yeah. Nice perception bonus.
Cletus Cobbington 01:07:25 I see. There we go. Yeah. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:07:35 So you could roll all of your rolls from this, but also if you want to roll physical dice, that's fine. Just keep it consistent. The natural 20 is the highest thing.
Dungeon Master 01:07:48 Like, not a whole lot of, like, disturbance, but you notice Zara with, like, a very keen eye that almost at the seam of where, like, the floor meets the wall and the ceiling meets the wall, there is this thin black sort of, like, ichor, like this sludge that is ever so slightly leaking into the space, and it seems to get a little bit heavier this way opposed to this way.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:12 I'll indicate to Callahan and Leo, look at that sludge. See how it's thicker down there? Maybe we go that way.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:28 I take a little scoop of that with my finger, my extended middle finger, and maybe try and sample it on my palate and do an investigation check to see what that might be. Yeah, I'm just going to kind of dab it on my on my tongue and try and get a little taste. So what's going on there?
Dungeon Master 01:08:43 Uh, yeah. Do you like put it on your tongue or like scoop it up and put it in a controlled thing? Um.
Cyrus Schwert 01:09:01 You have the tongue.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:02 Ah, well, you know, the I don't have a tongue per se, but I do have a little tasty palate back there. Not super great. Probably going to have some ill effects from that.
Dungeon Master 01:09:12 I have to find. Yeah, we'll get to that in a second. You don't notice anything at first, but you like, it tastes bitter and sour. It's like a gross taste. You do get with just licking it and maybe not a best roll. You can tell this is like fungal in nature. Like it tastes very mushroomy, like just the,
Zariel Torgan 01:09:29 Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:09:40 the taste of it just reminds you of a mushroom, the best way to describe it? No. Doesn't seem the same. No, this tastes grossed.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:44 Okay. Does, uh, does it harken back to some of the mushroom creatures we faced, uh, early on? Kind of gives me that. Okay. It's a little, a little different than that, but. Oh dear. That was rancid. A little mushrooming too.
Kaladen Shash 01:10:09 You stop putting everything in your mouth. Not good for you. Yes, to the left, not to the right. The right, you see down here, was not so eager. Yes, through there.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:12 Should we go a little bit further? Yeah. So can I pass through this passageway?
Leopold Magnus 01:10:15 Well, that's some wise advice, I suppose. Maybe I should take it to heart.
Dungeon Master 01:10:34 Yeah. You go into. As you get into this room, you see at the top of the room, almost like where I'm pointing kind of deal, just like huddled into the corner of where the whole room comes together. You see like this black.
Kaladen Shash 01:10:42 Silence.
Dungeon Master 01:10:52 slimy looking cocoon. And as you step into the space, there's not like a tripwire or anything, but you see this bold thread goes around the entire room, almost like it was set off by your presence. And it goes up and it triggers and it hits this little cocoon thing. And it spits out this gross looking, like insectoid creature that starts this
Zariel Torgan 01:11:05 Ooh. Oh, nice.
Dungeon Master 01:11:21 disgusting, overstimulating, pissing, buzzing sound. I need everybody to roll initiative. Okay, you can start cheating.
Kaladen Shash 01:11:21 Okay. Get rid of those, stop doing them.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:34 Another natural 20. I know, this is where, these are the best spots for them.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:37 Oh man, you're gonna really land that natural one when you really need it the most. Ooh, that guy has a proboscis if I've ever seen one. Straight to jail.
Dungeon Master 01:11:54 You should put yourself in. In jail for that one. Great to go. OK, do we have everybody? Cyrus, what did you get? And.
Kaladen Shash 01:11:59 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:12:16 10.
Dungeon Master 01:12:20 I think that's everybody, okay. First up with a natural 20 is Zariel. If everybody wanted to be out of it. Nobody's moving their tokens, that's the only thing. So if you guys are all in the room, you're all in the room. If you're that far back, you're that far back.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:28 Glad the only one in the room. Yeah, if I'm the only one in there, I'm gonna cast Poison Spray. It's gonna be a con save 15.
Cletus Cobbington 01:12:31 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:13:02 Natural 2 for a 3.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:05 Alright, that'll be 10 poison damage. And, let's see... As a bonus action, I'm going to... I don't have any good bonus action economy. I'm just gonna... I'm the only one in here. I'll just stay where I am. I'm good. I'll just...
Cletus Cobbington 01:13:23 Silence.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:32 I'm not going to move. Actually, I'll get further away from the door. That way, more people can come in.
Dungeon Master 01:13:42 Okay, you get into the corner, this thing's looking at you very fittingly. Up next is this creature known as a chasme. You don't know that, this is just a large fry, a fly, a large fry. On its turn, I need everybody who is within 30 feet, which I believe is everybody. Just about, yeah, everybody fits right into the 30 foot space.
Kaladen Shash 01:14:05 Yeah. With advantage, of course. No, I didn't mean it. I was just joking. I mean, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:14:10 Give me a Constitution-saving throw. Another Nat 20, dude.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:18 Oh, okay. God damn you guys. That's the third Nat 20 in a row.
Cyrus Schwert 01:14:20 Yeah. You got it. That's crazy.
Kaladen Shash 01:14:33 Mine did roll too, though. That's funny. I did not. 11.
Leopold Magnus 01:14:37 Jeez.
Cletus Cobbington 01:14:40 you
Dungeon Master 01:14:40 That's three in a row. Did anybody not beat 12?
Zariel Torgan 01:14:48 Oh, no. Whoa.
Dungeon Master 01:14:51 Kaladin, you fall unconscious. As this noise hits your large, fey ears, it rings your head, and you almost feel like it shakes you out of presentness. You dissociate first, and then your vision goes tunnel, and you black out. You guys see that Kaladin falls to the ground. It will then...
Cyrus Schwert 01:14:56 Is this normal?
Cletus Cobbington 01:15:17 Well, that ain't good. Does he usually do this?
Zariel Torgan 01:15:19 Now, I'll put up my four chins.
Dungeon Master 01:15:24 Go in and it'll attack. Zario does a 16 hit. OK. That is it. After you, it is Leopold. Leopold, you see, to wrap it all up at this point,
Kaladen Shash 01:15:25 when.
Cletus Cobbington 01:15:49 you
Zariel Torgan 01:15:50 Uh,
Dungeon Master 01:15:51 Zarya went to this room, triggered it, this creature came out, it started making this loud ringing noise that knocked Kaladin unconscious, but nothing else has happened yet. Oh, it went to attack him, but it didn't hit.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:04 Okay. Let's see. I'll maybe just kind of bend down and shake Kaladin a little bit. Oh, oh, oh dear. Kind of panicking, shaking him, assuming he doesn't rouse.
Dungeon Master 01:16:24 Hold on. That does not help.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:33 Well, I guess him unconscious, I'll leave him at the floor. And I'll say, Bone Crusher, get in there! Xario needs some help! And then I will... From the rear, I will cast Firebolt. As an action.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:34 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:17:00 Roll to hit. 12 does not hit.
Leopold Magnus 01:17:03 Oh dear. 12. Okay. And then as a bonus action, I will pull up a set of Magic Stones. And then I guess there's no token out for Bone Crusher, but he will run in, and I guess, what do you have, flanking with Zariel?
Cyrus Schwert 01:17:05 That helps come in a room.
Dungeon Master 01:17:30 Well, no, this creature is in the corner, so he couldn't get on the other side of it. Give me a moment. I don't always have your robot. From your viewpoint, would you be able to see him? Because you're in the room.
Leopold Magnus 01:17:33 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:17:40 While we're doing that, just for posterity's sake, did I see Kaladin go down? Or was I in the room? Yeah, I don't know. That was my question. I think I was originally over here. OK. All right. So yeah, I don't know. OK. All right.
Cletus Cobbington 01:17:55 You You
Dungeon Master 01:17:59 Right, yeah, so if you are in the room and it happened on its turn, you were around the corner at that point? Yeah. Sorry, what was the question?
Kaladen Shash 01:18:06 Yeah. Brady just made a terrible noise.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:09 That's fine. I just wanted to. Yeah. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:18:11 Did that thing come in the room? Did that thing come in the room that we're in?
Leopold Magnus 01:18:25 No, I think it's... Blew out Kaladin's Eardrums. So yeah, anyways, he makes a Force-Empowered Rend attack and misses.
Dungeon Master 01:18:25 It's in the room that Jesse's in. I think everybody else is out of it at this point. It's just anybody that could hear it was affected. He does, yes. Here he, there he is.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:40 if raised.
Dungeon Master 01:19:01 This is his little robot guy. Up next would be Cowden.
Leopold Magnus 01:19:05 For folks who haven't seen it before, it kind of meshes with Leopold's body when not in use. And when deployed, it kind of comes out of Leopold from his shoulders.
Kaladen Shash 01:19:30 Is there a saving throw I can make? Okay, hanging out.
Zariel Torgan 01:19:32 Yeah, does he get to roll the save?
Dungeon Master 01:19:36 The effect on that creature ends if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to splash it with holy water. If a creature succeeds the saving throw, it is immune to it for the next 24 hours. So no, there is no save. Cyrus, your turn.
Cletus Cobbington 01:19:54 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:02 So,
Cyrus Schwert 01:20:04 I have to fight this thing. I run in there with it. I run into the next room. And I just run. Hold on. Oh my. Let's try it again.
Dungeon Master 01:20:27 Okay. He goes through a moment, yeah. 14 does not hit. You realize in this moment that you never gave him any gear. He's just got a regular sword at this point.
Cletus Cobbington 01:20:37 See lagging bad for everybody else.
Cyrus Schwert 01:20:38 Oh god. Well, I have two attacks, so I'll try again. Boom!
Zariel Torgan 01:20:39 Yeah. Hey.
Dungeon Master 01:21:01 20. Natural 20 obviously hits. Go ahead and this is. It's. 2D6 plus 12, so that's. An additional six damage on that, but 20 damage total.
Kaladen Shash 01:21:16 for me.
Cyrus Schwert 01:21:20 okay i just wail as i swing at this thing i told you i'm sick with it
Leopold Magnus 01:21:29 Cletus, is he always that good with a sword? Take your word for it.
Cletus Cobbington 01:21:37 He is indubitably sick with it.
Dungeon Master 01:21:45 Anything else on your turn, Travis? That was action, attack, attack. Anything for bonus action? Bards can inspire, if you've got a bonus action, spell.
Cyrus Schwert 01:21:53 in my journal. No. I'll give Leopold, who's in here, a bardic.
Dungeon Master 01:22:22 What do you say or do to Leopold that inspires him? He's looking you right in the eyes. But next up is actually Cletus.
Cyrus Schwert 01:22:28 Please save me. Please save me. I don't know what to do.
Cletus Cobbington 01:22:30 I guess I'll do the helping. Let's see. First, let's see. Quick question. So would lesser restoration be able to help?
Leopold Magnus 01:22:34 Me? Who? Are you sure? I don't know.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:40 Sure.
Cletus Cobbington 01:23:03 Or is that something I need to try? You touch one creature and can end either one. Blind, deaf, and paralyzed, poisoned. Does this count? All right. Well, then I will lesser restoration Mr. Kaladin.
Dungeon Master 01:23:03 Let me read it real quick. I'm going to say lesser restoration works in this scenario.
Kaladen Shash 01:23:06 It doesn't sound like it's damage or holy water. Right.
Cletus Cobbington 01:23:33 That's who's down, right? Little splash. Yeah, that's my action. I'm just gonna bonus action Shillelagh my quarterstaff.
Dungeon Master 01:23:33 You pour a little bit of almond milk on his face and give him a little bit of slap. Comes to out and you see this large cow man over you and this squirrel looks a little concerned on his shoulder. Just kind of giving you a reassuring look. Anything else on your turn Cletus? That's action I believe.
Dungeon Master 01:24:00 Bonus action, Shillelagh. Nice. At the top, Zahra, it is your turn again. It looks kind of hurt. Doesn't look like it's about to flee from being on its deathbed. But it's taken, you know, 30 points of damage.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:09 All right, based on the amount of damage I've seen this thing take, is it showing anywhere at all or is it still too early? All right, well, I'm not gonna burn a bunch of stuff on it then. I'm gonna hit it with another poison spray. So it's another con save 15.
Dungeon Master 01:24:39 What is the spray of cone? Can you avoid everybody else in the room? Cool. Natural 7 for a total of 8.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:43 Um, it just says a puff of noxious gas. So it's a range of 10 feet. It doesn't say, uh, all right. So yeah, so it takes seven poison damage. Um, and then, yeah, it doesn't say in the thing, it just says range slash area, 10 feet. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:24:50 or two.
Dungeon Master 01:25:11 I think you're good then. I think you just got your wild shapes. OK. It is the creature's turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:14 then yeah it takes another 7 poison damage and uh... see if I can do anything as a bonus action I don't think I have any uh... yeah that's all I got yeah so I'll just hang back
Dungeon Master 01:25:40 Can't do a whole lot so. Oh, it does have advantage on managed saving for us. I should do that next time, so it's just going to. It's got all these people around it. The only one that actually looks like it's squishy would be Cyrus, so it's going to try to stick it for biscuits into you. Does a Jesus and ate it? I don't think it does.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:43 We have a lot of it. Oh, I can see. Put us. Oh, there's running around for you.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:08 Sounds like sandpaper.
Dungeon Master 01:26:13 That's a miss. That's a great use of its turn. Leopold What was that?
Cyrus Schwert 01:26:14 I hear.
Cletus Cobbington 01:26:31 Sure, everything is fucked.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:38 We're going to see Gabe's face.
Dungeon Master 01:26:42 Anyway, that didn't hit him, so it doesn't do anything on its turn after that would be Leopold. Unless... Cyrus is going to do something about it.
Leopold Magnus 01:26:48 Hey, what's that?
Kaladen Shash 01:26:49 What?
Cyrus Schwert 01:26:52 I think it's fucked. On my turn, I took the slasher feat. So when I hit a critical hit until my next round starts, they would do a disadvantage. It didn't end up mattering, but they have disadvantage on attack rolls when I crit until my next turn.
Dungeon Master 01:27:14 Oh, the attacker. Gotcha. Yeah. Good to know. Going forward. Yes.
Leopold Magnus 01:27:29 Okay. My turn. All right. Uh, so with inspiration, what does that, what does that give me? Got it. Uh, you cut out a D what?
Cyrus Schwert 01:27:38 You can add a DA to Ability Checks, Attack Rolls, or Saving Throws. The thing in the app says 1 DA, but...
Kaladen Shash 01:27:48 Just in. D6 right now. Oh, D8, nice. Great.
Dungeon Master 01:27:48 Is it a D8 or a D6? D8?
Leopold Magnus 01:28:01 Go to, okay, sweet. Oh, oh, okay, I guess I could come save you, although I'm not quite sure if I'm the one for the job. And I'll bust through the door. Assuming my Steel Defender can scoot over, is there enough room for me to get in there and attack? Okay. And I'll extend my Searing Saber.
Dungeon Master 01:28:20 Yeah, let's say it gave you enough space. For Travis and Trace, as an artificer, Rex has built a lightsaber. So that's one of his weapons.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:28 and take a slice at this creature.
Cyrus Schwert 01:28:44 That's cool.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:44 Yeah, it looks similar to a scimitar, so it has a really long, curved blade. And the flames on the edge are hot orange, and then they kind of wisp off into more, I guess, red, violet colors as it dissipates on the backside of the blade. So 21 to hit? Excellent.
Dungeon Master 01:29:09 But one hits. Separate the fire damage if you haven't already, because it's got resistance to fire.
Leopold Magnus 01:29:13 So... Slice at him. Oof! X damage. And then... Oh yeah. Wait, I guess it... So there's a 1d10 plus 6 or 1d8 plus 6. If I'm wearing a shield, I need to be rolling to 1d8, don't I?
Dungeon Master 01:29:40 Yes, if you have a shield on, you're rolling the 1d8. Well, 3, so it'll take 15 on that turn instead.
Leopold Magnus 01:29:43 OK, I'll reroll that. So 12 damage on the strike and then for the fire. 6 damage. OK, well then, so with my second attack. All come back around and after swinging through it, say take this you filthy animal. Uh.
Cletus Cobbington 01:29:50 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:10 not one but I'm gonna I'm inspired so I'll add a d8 uh and also one so 11 yeah
Dungeon Master 01:30:10 Natural one. And.
Kaladen Shash 01:30:10 Mm-hmm. Oh, it knew what it meant to be. There you go.
Cyrus Schwert 01:30:11 Oh no. You were supposed to save me!
Zariel Torgan 01:30:25 in the meetings. Sorry.
Dungeon Master 01:30:27 You see, he says he swings his lightsaber around and it like, it's so hot that he catches the wall and the blade sort of embeds into the wall like melts it a little bit like from Star Wars one, he's like caught and he can't do it. And you see he like, goes, I'm feeling inspired. He pushes a little bit harder and nothing happens. And he turns it off and turns it back on and the sword is out and ahead of him again. But that is your action.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:51 Kind of clanking at this damn thing and it's it's turning on it's turning off. It's turning on it's turning off I'm gonna have to take a look with that later and I will then Use my bonus action to throw a stone, but I think I'm so close will be disadvantaged Yeah
Zariel Torgan 01:30:56 Celebrities being more aggressive and antagonistic.
Dungeon Master 01:31:12 That's correct, yes. It's one time use. 14 just methods.
Leopold Magnus 01:31:20 14. Does that inspiration only for one thing, right? Got it. Yeah, bummer. All right, so the stone kind of harries wide, and that's Leopold's turn, but then the defender will attack and will splice with a force-empowered rend. Also 14. Misses, and that's my turn.
Kaladen Shash 01:31:28 Mark.
Cyrus Schwert 01:31:29 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 01:31:34 Yeah. I was.
Cletus Cobbington 01:31:42 you.
Dungeon Master 01:31:46 14 off. And nobody, oh, Kaladin, you were awake. You have your turn. I'm going to say half your movement to get up, but you have full use of your turn. If you take like one step to the right, you would. It has half cover because so many people are around it.
Kaladen Shash 01:32:00 Excellent. I have line of sight right now on big creature. I'll give it. I'll give it. App covers two.
Zariel Torgan 01:32:02 documentation. I either be like, Hey, these kind of things are going to happen to you. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:32:16 But that just adds three to its AC, I think. Hold on, let me check. Half cover is two, yes. So its AC is essentially 17 for any sort of ranged attack.
Zariel Torgan 01:32:32 Nice. Oh no.
Kaladen Shash 01:32:32 Okay. Uh, I'll go ahead and do that. Cause I don't think I can even get to it with my movement right now. I'll, uh, go ahead and pass this object blast. First one misses. Yeah. Second one, this is, that was like a 15. It tried, it tried really hard.
Dungeon Master 01:32:49 First one misses. Second one misses. Third one. Only within that one. 17 hits.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:01 They both hit Leo. Yeah. Nice.
Kaladen Shash 01:33:06 Yeah, meets it, beats it. That's forced damage there. That's good. Now I'll use 15 feet to get to the doorway. Try not to block it.
Dungeon Master 01:33:22 Yeah. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:30 because that's what
Dungeon Master 01:33:32 Cyrus, at the start of your turn, you see that this thing is pretty crowded at this point. There's not a whole lot of wiggle room. You were the last creature that it attacked, though, so its attention is focused on you. You see this blast, two blasts sort of hit the wall up high, spray it with dust, and then this third sort of energy beam hits it at the top, like the tip of its wing, and sort of singes that a little bit. But you have your turn.
Cyrus Schwert 01:33:59 I'm just in an anxious frenzy, just still swinging at the thing. I don't know how far we're going, so I don't want to burn spells and stuff. So I'll swing with my scimitar again. I'll probably miss that. I almost swing twice. Perfect. And then I'll do two.
Dungeon Master 01:34:16 11 misses. 24 hits. It's looking hurt.
Cyrus Schwert 01:34:31 I swing. I nick it. Just barely. I'm hurting it! Look at me! I'm an adventurer! And that'll be my turn.
Cletus Cobbington 01:34:34 It's so foul.
Kaladen Shash 01:34:38 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:34:49 Clean as you hear that from the room, you're the only one in this other room at this point everybody has rushed in and like they're kind of title like swarming the door you see cow it's so full that count is like not in the room which is sort of standing on the out. And you see chip is sort of just leaning on your neck and he just goes I don't really know what they're doing in there.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:04 Oh, really isn't trouble.
Cletus Cobbington 01:35:11 I say We definitely know what they're doing because I don't understand what he's saying And then I rush at the door and go in for an attack With my core staff Okay Here goes another
Dungeon Master 01:35:32 26 hits. Your dice is pretty. 10 damage. Looking incredibly hurt. Okay. Up at the top, Zariel. This thing looks on death's door.
Cletus Cobbington 01:35:48 I think, yep, that's that's me.
Zariel Torgan 01:36:09 My mic was, that was my, oh, that was me, sorry. I'm going to do what I've been doing, because it's been working. I'm going to spray it with poison again. On 15. Oh my god. Oh. Well, it'll take two damage if it hits.
Dungeon Master 01:36:09 Sorry, y'all. And it gets to roll with advantage because it has magic resistance. That just wasn't doing that before.
Kaladen Shash 01:36:38 Wapping.
Zariel Torgan 01:36:40 a whopping two damage. I could do more if I slapped it. No, it takes zero because it's a cantrip. Yeah. Don't say splooge. Don't say splooge. You can't. Don't do that to me.
Dungeon Master 01:36:42 Nice, it passes to take one damage. Oh, is it a cantrip? Okay. You see Zariel sort of like Spider-Man, holds out his hand, and this little splooge of sort of poison sort of flies out and hits its insect fly leg, and it sort of flops on the ground, kind of chunky, super ineffective.
Cyrus Schwert 01:36:53 Chunky splood. Jeez.
Cletus Cobbington 01:36:59 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:37:07 Cheers.
Dungeon Master 01:37:11 This creature looks at you after having done that and it sort of looks kind of concerned if it could. Mostly just because it's incredibly hurt, but it'll take its probably final attack on you. Does a 18 hit. Mrs can't hit you guys for shit. OK. Uh.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:17 Easy. Easy. Now, this audience is not shared by more of the journal. Yourself.
Cyrus Schwert 01:37:32 18 doesn't hit? That's crazy. He is a suit of armor, so it kind of makes sense.
Cletus Cobbington 01:37:36 Silence. Silence.
Dungeon Master 01:37:36 They spent the whole first part of the campaign, like, maxing out their AC. They're incredibly hard, man. Sir Leopold here, who's up next, has 21 AC. It does. Leopold, your turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:43 11 may push back his critics.
Leopold Magnus 01:38:00 Ah, excellent. Oh, dear. And I'll kind of slap my saber again with it pointed in the general direction of this creature. And I will take an attack, which is just me accidentally activating my lightsaber right into the gut of this thing. Nine damage on that, and then half damage on the fire.
Cletus Cobbington 01:38:15 Subs by www.zeoranger.co.uk
Dungeon Master 01:38:17 24 a dip. How does Leopold finish it?
Kaladen Shash 01:38:19 Folks that.
Leopold Magnus 01:38:29 Uh, so. Oh yeah, so after my debacle of mess, I I've kind of tinkering with my saber. I'm slapping it. It's kind of fluttering on and off and like guys, I don't know what's going on here. I can't seem to get this thing to work and he slaps it and the saber blade just goes.
Leopold Magnus 01:38:48 and it goes right clean through the creature. And then he slaps it again and it deactivates and he doesn't even notice that he killed the thing. He's like, I don't know what's wrong with this. I really must take a break and look at it. And then he looks up and it's slumped over to the floor and I'm like, oh, Cyrus, boy, was that you? You really are good with a sword. I didn't even notice.
Dungeon Master 01:38:49 Hmm.
Zariel Torgan 01:39:14 You know, soon he's. It doesn't.
Leopold Magnus 01:39:18 And that is it.
Dungeon Master 01:39:18 You guys have killed this creature.
Dungeon Master 01:39:22 With this moment of rest and catching your breath, this thing's head cut clean off with the searing saber. You notice that in this room, there just seems to be a little outcropping in the back here. And once this creature dies, you see again, like the magic sort of expands out from underneath it and spreads through the whole room. And you see appearing on this little pedestal in this little outcropping is a orb.
Zariel Torgan 01:39:44 And she has 10 keys in it. It wasn't even a thick skin. Interesting. And Sylvan? Great. Interesting.
Kaladen Shash 01:39:54 Perhaps these are the keys, the order of itself.
Dungeon Master 01:39:55 This. This orb has the number 5 on it. Just the number, it's just will say all the numbers are the same. We'll do Roman, it's just a V.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:15 Does somebody want to grab it or?
Kaladen Shash 01:40:22 I'll grab it. I'll grab this order, put it in my backpack. Is there anything special to it? Does it seem to be magical or is it just kind of...
Dungeon Master 01:40:28 Okay, you grab it. You guys have. Doesn't even seem, doesn't seem magical by itself. It just seems like it's, it's like a little grapefruit size. Like it's not small. It's not like a marble. It's not huge. It's just like a fist sized stone smooth orb with the Roman numeral five on it.
Cletus Cobbington 01:40:38 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:46 If I'm honest, and this is a bad look on all of us, we included 100% Green Leader who participated. There's nothing else in there, just opens up or bam. To kind of pursue these young women and criticize them because they have gotten so
Kaladen Shash 01:40:52 Okay. Yes, very deductive. We'll keep you in the group for your first math skills.
Dungeon Master 01:41:04 That's it.
Cyrus Schwert 01:41:07 So we have to do that nine more times? I slashed the shit out of him, that's for sure. I slashed him good.
Leopold Magnus 01:41:13 Oh, you... You did such a good job following that creature, these other nine should be nothing to you.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:20 Yeah, he's a little gargley.
Kaladen Shash 01:41:26 I don't know if anyone else can hear Travis. He's just like not coming in clear. Okay, that's not his name. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:41:44 Yeah, he's cutting out.
Dungeon Master 01:41:45 He's gargling. Because he's in his garage.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:49 Yeah, let's do it. Let's just start rushing them.
Cletus Cobbington 01:41:49 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:41:55 let us let let let us move on what is what's this other area what's behind this door or this door we can do this let us hope for more insects
Cyrus Schwert 01:42:02 wrong.
Dungeon Master 01:42:13 You see that this way leads to this tunnel that goes down and around and goes to this way? You guys are splitting up? Well, if you guys do, just tell me the order. Who is in what group? What are you doing?
Leopold Magnus 01:42:16 We could split up and kill them faster.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:19 Yeah, let's do that. Yeah, I'll go.
Kaladen Shash 01:42:32 No, you never, never split the party. Unreal. Okay, who's, yes, who's staying with the peasants?
Cletus Cobbington 01:42:36 I'm just, yeah. I'm just sitting in the corner petting a squirrel.
Dungeon Master 01:42:47 Jesus. The squirrel is simultaneously feeding you almonds as you pet it, just into your mouth.
Cyrus Schwert 01:42:48 you must not be talking about me I mean I'm not full elf but I'm not half bad
Leopold Magnus 01:42:49 Oh, well, I wouldn't really stoop that low. You know, Cletus is a bit different, but I don't know if I'd call him a peasant.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:51 How about Leo? Okay, Callan, why don't you and me hit this hallway over here and then the rest of them can do that long one.
Kaladen Shash 01:43:03 What? Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:43:09 Thank you. Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:24 So I'll push open this door.
Dungeon Master 01:43:32 OK, you guys, so we'll do just who wants to do first. Will do like room by room. You guys will do something and then the other team will do something. That's just like you do it to everybody in a party, so you can do it to everybody here if you want to.
Kaladen Shash 01:43:42 Um, Jonathan, remind me, how many flowers can I, is that, was it like a 30 foot radius? Is it only so many friendlies? Okay. Okay. Cause I think it would have already had my mask on, but the other two now just kind of a little flower blooms by their ear. Then they hear my voice in their heads.
Kaladen Shash 01:44:12 Now you can talk to me. You don't have to yell.
Dungeon Master 01:44:14 We got, we got rapport spores up in this bitch. But yeah, you see Kaladin puts on this, this gas mask looking thing with flowers on the inside of it, like he's breathing in nature. And he gets a little more fey when he puts it on. He like touches you on the shoulder and you sprout a flower out of your ear, almost like somebody tucked a flower in, but like it sprouts out of your head technically. And when that's there and that's present, you have a telepathic link with him.
Cletus Cobbington 01:44:18 Is this thing on? I knock it really loud.
Dungeon Master 01:44:42 And like a whole party, it's like a group chat. He's the one who can take it off, but you can also decide to take it off if you want to. But he would have to put it back on. So they have a way of chatting with each other that you guys are now all in.
Kaladen Shash 01:44:59 Let us know when you need backup. Leopold, you can do it. Take care of them. Fight well.
Cyrus Schwert 01:44:59 Okay, Mr. High and Mighty, Mr. Colwell. I think we'll be fine, thank you. I told you I'm sick with it. I feel like I've proven it and I'll try.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:03 Yeah, we're just right over here.
Cletus Cobbington 01:45:03 to a
Leopold Magnus 01:45:04 I think it's a if, not when. We're perfectly capable here. Cyrus is leading the way.
Dungeon Master 01:45:15 Group A or group B?
Zariel Torgan 01:45:32 Thanks.
Kaladen Shash 01:45:33 Bye.
Cletus Cobbington 01:45:33 You're having like a little glow up right now. It is real work, I'll tell you that. All right.
Cyrus Schwert 01:45:35 My mom wanted me to, you know, my father wanted me to have a real job, you know, not just sitting around or whatever. He doesn't think it's a real job, so I needed to go work on the farm. I didn't want to. I wanted to be a writer, where I am now. Yeah, it sucks. Okay, we go in the door.
Cletus Cobbington 01:46:00 I try real hard to find an attack to stab my finger on for this door again. Slapping the walls. I just happen to push it open while I'm doing it.
Dungeon Master 01:46:06 Yeah. Looking for a slap in the wall. Looking for a duck. It's a normal door. It opens up into a normal room. And you see it goes down a hallway. Yeah, you think you're right, too. Down a hallway into this door right here. Do you choose to open the door at the end of the hallway?
Cyrus Schwert 01:46:08 Even though there's a hand on. Yes.
Zariel Torgan 01:46:15 Silence. Silence.
Cletus Cobbington 01:46:30 Yes. I write Open Sesame on it.
Dungeon Master 01:46:33 Okay, we'll get to you guys in a second. First, you cut your hand again for no reason, and you're just writing open sesame on a wooden door. You get a splinter in the process. We will say, Group A, Kaladin and Zariel, do you go through that door?
Zariel Torgan 01:46:52 Absolutely. What do you think? Absolutely.
Kaladen Shash 01:46:52 Yes. Let us try the door first, perhaps see if this is something.
Dungeon Master 01:46:54 It is one empty room. You go through another one. It's a second empty room where your guys decision comes in. Is that you notice that it goes to one doorway at the top and then it splits to another hallway that goes that way to the left. OK.
Dungeon Master 01:47:24 You open the door, Kaladin leading it sounds like, and the exact same thing happens that happened before, but we'll hit the first party that did it. Cletus, as you push open this door and you step into the space, that little gold thread sort of runs around the entire room before it hits up at the top and there's like that black, ickery cocoon that spits out this
Kaladen Shash 01:47:52 Good.
Dungeon Master 01:47:54 creature looks like, like that. It sort of like seeps onto the ground. It's like tenderly goopiness sort of coming off the ground as it rises back up. At the top, Kaladin and Zariel, you see another one of those fly creatures gets ejected from a similar cocoon as you step into this room. I need everybody to just roll ahead, roll initiative again.
Zariel Torgan 01:47:59 Ooh.
Cletus Cobbington 01:48:01 Hey, what the fuck?
Cyrus Schwert 01:48:10 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:48:24 We're going right back into it. OK. Oh, I just fucking cleared an issue. God damn it. Hold on while I put everything back.
Kaladen Shash 01:48:26 Really soft.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:28 Cool.
Cletus Cobbington 01:48:41 you
Zariel Torgan 01:48:55 You just want us to re-roll? Oh. Oh, OK. I rolled bad, so I was cool with re-rolling.
Dungeon Master 01:48:57 No, if I put you back into initiative it adds your last one instead. It's just a lot of buttons I gotta press because I fucking cleared it instead of just hitting reset. Of course you are. To the top. First thing to act is this creature, which is just called a shadow demon technically, but it is going to
Kaladen Shash 01:48:59 Next time.
Dungeon Master 01:49:24 Rush to fill the doorway before you fully get all the way in. And let me pull up. First thing it's going to do. Is. Oh, it doesn't do a whole lot, does it? Easy, it'll take. That's got one. One claw attack on Cletus.
Dungeon Master 01:49:55 Does a 10 hit? Oh, ignore the damage. That's not anything.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:57 Jesus.
Cletus Cobbington 01:49:58 No.
Dungeon Master 01:50:13 Well, that was its turn. I didn't realize it only had one thing it could do. Okay, up next is the Steel Defender, technically. In this hallway, though, if this is the order that you guys marched in at, it can't get by everybody, so it can't really do anything on its turn unless it's got a ranged attack, Rex.
Zariel Torgan 01:50:34 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 01:50:36 It does, but I guess the question is, does it have its own initiative or does it just always follow Leopold's? OK. OK, well, I guess, I mean, in this case, we're all stacked up here, so just use a range stack doesn't necessarily matter when.
Dungeon Master 01:50:43 It would follow yours, but it used its last initiative that I gave it. So it's at the same time or after you, so you could act first.
Leopold Magnus 01:51:03 But Leopold will launch an ice knife at the creature and try to target the explosion behind it so that way it doesn't hit Cletus.
Dungeon Master 01:51:22 Okay, so you want to intentionally miss the first attack to get the explosion attack? Yeah, so if it's in range for Cletus to hit him, it would hit the demon and then explode and hit Cletus. But you could intentionally miss the attack and just have the explosion hit behind.
Leopold Magnus 01:51:29 Well, I guess it has a five-foot bubble, right? So would that hit Cletus? Okay, I see. That's all right. I guess what I'll do here is,
Cletus Cobbington 01:51:48 You
Leopold Magnus 01:51:59 I won't do Ice Knife. I will just do Ray of Frost instead. And roll the hit. Ooh, nat 20. Nice. So that's double damage, right? All right.
Zariel Torgan 01:52:10 Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:52:15 Mm-hmm. That's old damage, correct?
Leopold Magnus 01:52:27 Yes, cold damage. That's right. Oh, dear.
Dungeon Master 01:52:31 You throw this ray of frost over everybody's head as to not hit them, and it hits this creature, and you see almost physically passes through its form, having not just a reduced effect, but no effect on the creature. It is immune to cold damage.
Cletus Cobbington 01:52:51 Oh.
Zariel Torgan 01:52:54 Oof.
Leopold Magnus 01:52:57 Why does this always happen to me? And with that, I'll use a bonus action and cast one of my stones at it. Yeah, so I'll have one more remaining after this. 19 to hit. All right, it will take...
Dungeon Master 01:53:12 I'll go ahead and throw. This is your second stone, correct? 19 hits. Yes, it does. Takes eight damage.
Leopold Magnus 01:53:26 8 damage from the stone, assuming it's not immune. With Leopold's turn over, a Steel Defender will extend its arm and you'll see a surge of energy from its fist and blast out a Firebolt. 12 to hit.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:32 Okay. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:53:48 Okay, go ahead and roll to hit. 12 misses. Okay. Leopold and Steel Defender. Up next is Cletus, still in the same fighting circle.
Leopold Magnus 01:53:58 It flies wide. And with that, Leopold's turn is over.
Cletus Cobbington 01:54:13 Mm-hmm I'm just gonna go in and swing my staff at this crazy bitch That's a 12-hit oh Damn I didn't know I had a high staff
Dungeon Master 01:54:28 You come in, circle around, stay in its space so it doesn't hit you. 12 misses. 12 just misses. Chip finds that hilarious, because I found that hilarious.
Kaladen Shash 01:54:39 Yep.
Cletus Cobbington 01:54:46 All right, that's me. Thanks.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:47 All right. I want to move in and get around.
Dungeon Master 01:54:51 This is Ariel. You are up. We're going to the top room. At this point, Kaladin has just stepped into this room and this creature has spawned in, but you were behind him, but have first action here.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:12 position myself behind the creature and shove it forward. That way we're on either side of it. All right, well, I'll stand here just in case it moves. And I'll go ahead and do a, let's see. Actually, you know what I'll do? Instead of doing that,
Dungeon Master 01:55:19 No, not at this point. See, it always sort of ejects at the corner of the room and it hasn't acted yet, so it hasn't moved. So you can't get behind it.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:42 I'll stop right here, and I'll do a Thorn Whip. That's going to be a natural 20 to hit. It's my fourth nat 20. That's going to be 15 damage on a crit, and it is moved 10 feet closer to me.
Dungeon Master 01:55:55 It's at your fourth, not 20. Gotcha.
Kaladen Shash 01:55:57 Yes, just keeps coughing them up.
Cyrus Schwert 01:55:57 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:56:17 10 puts it exactly on you, but it would go a little bit quicker, but there is a stone pedestal in the middle of this room that is currently got nothing on it. You pull it until it hits that though. So it's like right in front of you, but behind the stone. Alrighty, alrighty.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:33 Alright, and then with the rest of my movement, I'm gonna go around here. That way, hopefully, Kaladin can get some advantage. If he wants to. Nice. Nice!
Dungeon Master 01:56:45 After your turn, Caledon, it is your turn. Hits, obviously. 13 hits.
Kaladen Shash 01:56:49 As they begin to rush, you know. Cast a soft trick blast again. First ones in that 20. Count that. Uh. Second one is going to miss. Third one is going to miss. That's OK. All 13 hits. Alright, so it's a.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:16 Ooh. Nice. This is a fun fight song.
Dungeon Master 01:57:18 13 hits. 14 damage. Thanks!
Kaladen Shash 01:57:20 3D10. I'll close the distance and then take a large swing with light splitter with advantage. I'll roll a second one.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:45 Nice. Okay. Nice.
Kaladen Shash 01:57:48 That's pretty good. That's going to hit, but we'll just see if it's a natural 20. No. No. 29 hit. Yep. I do not. Yes. 17.
Dungeon Master 01:57:51 29 hit, let's see if you crit. 29 then. Have you guys rolled like 6 or 7 nat 20s in the night then? Because who else has a nat 20? Okay, so yeah, there are sick nat 20s. 17 damage, good damage. Looking pretty hurt, but not on death's door yet.
Leopold Magnus 01:58:03 I rolled one, but didn't do anything.
Cyrus Schwert 01:58:05 You're all gone.
Zariel Torgan 01:58:17 Fantastic.
Dungeon Master 01:58:22 After Kaladin's go, it is Cyrus back in other combat encounter. You are still in the hallway with this shadow creature that this has gone to the other side of. So you can kind of like see him through its sort of non fully corporeal form. He took a swing at it and then like he's talking to his squirrel about how he didn't realize his staff was made of ice. But it's your turn.
Cyrus Schwert 01:58:51 I just step home in the dirt and take a swing at him. Two swings with my car. I'm getting a little too big for my britches. Getting a little confident. Misplaced confidence. When he hit, I imagine.
Cletus Cobbington 01:58:54 you
Dungeon Master 01:59:03 Blue slings. 10 misses. 20 hits. Yes. 7 damage because you don't have a magical weapon. So you do 3 damage.
Cyrus Schwert 01:59:25 Fucked him right up, hooked him right up. Keep going.
Kaladen Shash 01:59:40 I think, yeah, I don't know. You may have given it back. I think I have the spear right now.
Zariel Torgan 01:59:41 I will add, I don't have anything good to give those guys. Check my inventory, I got nothing.
Leopold Magnus 01:59:42 Get in there, Cletus. Yeah, I also don't. I thought I gave it back or it went away. I don't remember what happened. I'll have to give it back when we meet up.
Dungeon Master 01:59:48 I'm pretty sure somebody else has. Other weapon, right? Somebody's got it. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:00:14 Yeah, the Deathcap spear. I've got that one. The Guardians Deathcap spear. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:00:19 Yeah, I was gonna say, somebody had that weapon and that's what I was sort of hinting to that the only non-caster had non-magical weapon would need, because I knew that this was coming up. Anyway, after Cyrus is this Chasme, you guys have already succeeded in the throw, so you can't be affected by its drone. It will stab... We'll say Kaladin this time.
Dungeon Master 02:00:51 If I could roll anything above a 10, I'd be fine. 12 to hit. Back up to the top, it's Shadow Demon's turn. It will... You say that physically in appearance, Cyrus looks very daunt, right?
Kaladen Shash 02:00:55 Does not hit.
Cletus Cobbington 02:01:13 I second that.
Cyrus Schwert 02:01:17 I'm a skinny boy. Who the hell does he know? Oh! This motherfucker kicked me.
Dungeon Master 02:01:20 He's going to attack you because he thinks you're the weaker target. Jesus. I roll the three. That's eight to hit, which misses, presumably. I can't roll above anything. Leopold, you're up, man.
Kaladen Shash 02:01:31 That is hot. It's hot. Did you never roll like this?
Zariel Torgan 02:01:34 the car.
Leopold Magnus 02:01:40 Oh dear. Let's see here. Immune to ice. I think what Leopold will do is just cast a Fireball. I can't get past Cyrus, can I?
Cletus Cobbington 02:01:46 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:02:02 No, not right at the doorway, you can't. 27 hits. Travis, I don't know why, but it thinks your character is dead and it won't let me change it.
Leopold Magnus 02:02:04 Yeah, so I'll just hurl a firebolt at the demon. Ooh, nice, 27 to hit. Yeah, it keeps thinking it's dead.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:24 Yeah. It's still zero out a few different times.
Cyrus Schwert 02:02:27 Yeah, I switched my health back to like I keep doing one damage on my character sheet and then healing it and it'll go back for like a second and then it just like goes right back to having zero. I don't know.
Cletus Cobbington 02:02:32 He's back.
Dungeon Master 02:02:40 Why does it do that? Oh, there it is. He's back, cool. Do this creature. You notice, and I'm sorry to do this to you, it takes the damage, but it just doesn't seem, it like gets swelled up by its form a little bit, and it seems reduced. It does half fire damage.
Leopold Magnus 02:02:49 Nailed it. Nine fire damage, uh, for that firebolt. Well, this asshole die already?
Zariel Torgan 02:03:00 Oh, no.
Dungeon Master 02:03:13 That's 20. Go ahead and roll double damage. That's number 7. 16 damage. Holy shit.
Leopold Magnus 02:03:14 And with that, I will do a bonus action and throw my last stone. Ah, not 20. 16 damage. Take that, you son of a bitch!
Cyrus Schwert 02:03:16 Really hit it. Oh, let's go.
Cletus Cobbington 02:03:22 you
Zariel Torgan 02:03:32 Nice.
Kaladen Shash 02:03:39 Great damage. Oops.
Dungeon Master 02:03:45 Looking much more hurt. Steel defenders turn. 26 hit and did we put a charge number on that? Is there only a certain number of times you can do that, or is he just have it? I don't remember.
Leopold Magnus 02:03:50 Steel Defender only has one ranged attack, so I guess he'll just do it. He's going to cast Firebolt. 26 to hit. I don't remember talking about that, but we can if we need to.
Dungeon Master 02:04:15 11 damage reduced to 6. I just don't remember if we had one. Okay, it's looking very hurt.
Kaladen Shash 02:04:26 Silence.
Dungeon Master 02:04:29 Up next, Cletus, down at the bottom. You were on the other side of it, you see Cyrus has come up and he stabbed it, but poor Cyrus, his weapon like physically you see gets like a little chewed up as he puts it through its form, like it is like actually being ineffective against it. Doing his best though, you have control of the room.
Zariel Torgan 02:04:43 you
Cletus Cobbington 02:04:50 Well, I Don't think anything I can do would really do all that much more so I'm a whack it again Okay, well I'm assuming a 16-hit
Dungeon Master 02:05:08 Whack it. With advantage. You guys are flanking at this point. I don't know, Travis, if you rolled with advantage, but you are opposing it. 16 hit, though. See if you crit, though. You know, why not? 16 still hits.
Cletus Cobbington 02:05:24 Nope. Oh, fuck. Five damage. Thanks, buddy. I need that.
Dungeon Master 02:05:36 Okay, hit it, five damage. Chip sort of gives you a shoulder squeeze, like you got it next time. Just a little. Zario, you were up at the top. Back in the room with this Kazmay.
Kaladen Shash 02:05:44 Now. 10 feet solid is right.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:54 All right. Let's see. I think I'll do a Poison Spray. So Con 15. And that's not gonna hit Kaladin, is it? I can direct it. You know what, actually, I won't do that. I'll do a Thorn. You didn't already roll, did you?
Dungeon Master 02:06:12 Yeah. No, this is poison damage though, right? I didn't realize that this creature is immune to poison damage. First one died out of freak chances.
Kaladen Shash 02:06:13 that just gets to the back side of the creature.
Zariel Torgan 02:06:26 Yeah. That's okay, I'm not gonna do it anyway. I'll do the Thorn Whip because then I'll get a... Okay. Oh. 30, 20. All right. That's gonna be seven piercing damage.
Cyrus Schwert 02:06:34 you
Dungeon Master 02:06:47 30, 20 hits. Increasing damage. Anything else on your turn? And it gets pulled towards you.
Zariel Torgan 02:07:05 That's it. That's all I got. I think it does, but I'm already touching it, basically.
Dungeon Master 02:07:15 You just kind of whiffed it a little bit. You see it blushes when you hit it on the ass, but after that it's Kaladin's turn. You'd have to move slightly forward. It got pulled just a little bit into... No, I'll say the benefit of his Storm Whip is that you got pulled out of melee.
Kaladen Shash 02:07:26 My current location, am I within melee range of the creature right now? So I'm not in melee is what you're saying. Alright, I'm going to step. I'm just going to step back 5 feet. And go ahead and cast this object last again as a bonus action.
Zariel Torgan 02:07:41 Nice.
Kaladen Shash 02:07:56 Personal hit. Second one misses. So. So the 2D10 right there. I'll run forward. And take another swing with light splitter again.
Dungeon Master 02:07:59 17 hits. Well, you missed it. 16 hits. Work team damage.
Zariel Torgan 02:08:18 Nice. Nice. Oh, no.
Kaladen Shash 02:08:30 Oh, both of those miss. Rush forward, but don't make it look really pretty. It's OK. Try to finish.
Dungeon Master 02:08:34 Does. All right. Not quite dead yet, but really close. Cyrus.
Dungeon Master 02:08:47 You are still flanking this creature with Thetis. A weird thing to do with your boss, but you guys have been through worse, I guess, technically. You do see your weapon is getting eaten up as you edit. You still have advantage, but you don't know that this weapon is going to be effective for much longer.
Cyrus Schwert 02:08:53 OK, well, I was drastically underprepared.
Zariel Torgan 02:08:57 Bye.
Cyrus Schwert 02:09:18 Spell-wise, I thought we were just walking through the forest. I'm just going to keep it again, I guess. I don't have any spells equipped that would do anything. There's the first one. I'm still with advantage. OK. We'll just do that first. I have to three, it seems.
Kaladen Shash 02:09:26 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:09:35 15 hits. 18 hits. Yeah. Seven. Three.
Cyrus Schwert 02:09:51 and I have to four, so seven damage total. Sick. And then I'll give a bardic to Cletus and say, and then I'll end my turn. And Cletus has a bardic.
Leopold Magnus 02:10:11 And say what now?
Dungeon Master 02:10:23 You have your Bardic. Uh, then after Cyrus is the Chasme. I'm going to just attack Zariel this time, just to mix it up. You take, well, 16 to hit. Okay. Shadow Demon. It will,
Cletus Cobbington 02:10:31 messes.
Dungeon Master 02:10:52 attack fetus this time. Jesus fucking Christ. Eight to hit. Uh you these creatures in separate rooms simultaneously just look a little anxious. There's something not working. One of them just goes like through its hibiscus just just like I promise this doesn't happen every day dude. I I can do better. Uh Leopold
Cyrus Schwert 02:11:08 shit
Cletus Cobbington 02:11:17 Silly demon that was an almond not me.
Dungeon Master 02:11:24 Both of them look very hurt. You could probably end it this round if you guys make contact.
Leopold Magnus 02:11:24 Okay. Uh, yeah. So, uh, with noticing that it is taking no ice damage and, uh, absorbing and brushing off the fire damage, Leopold reaches down, uh, is there, is this like a smooth stone tunnel, any stones, large stones laying around?
Cletus Cobbington 02:11:52 Alright.
Dungeon Master 02:11:54 You could find a stone.
Leopold Magnus 02:11:56 Okay, I'll kind of pull off a brick from the wall and I'll just throw it down the hatch into my chest cavity. And you hear this thunk and bend 90 degrees at the hips. And you hear this whirling where air seems to be pulling into Leopold's chest cavity. And I will do catapult, which is a deck save of 16.
Dungeon Master 02:12:22 Dex save just. No. Dex save 16. And I believe catapults and all or nothing spell, right? Hi. OK.
Leopold Magnus 02:12:33 Ah, beats it, beats it. Yeah, I think so. Failed save, object strikes target. Yeah, yeah, otherwise nothing. So a brick goes flying past Cyrus's head, missing the demon and shattering into a thousand pieces on the back wall.
Kaladen Shash 02:12:34 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:13:01 And with that, I will use a bonus action to cast Magic Stone so I can have a reload on there. Then Steel Defender will go, and we'll fire off a Firebolt. 17 to hit. 14 damage. It takes 7 damage of fire.
Dungeon Master 02:13:10 Awesome. Steel Defender. 17 hits. 14, half a seven. There. Incredibly hurt, but not dead.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:24 you.
Leopold Magnus 02:13:39 You guys can finish him! Get him! Get him!
Dungeon Master 02:13:42 Cletus, he says to you. Learning about his character. 12, you are inspired because 12 misses. But you also have advantage, so roll advantage first.
Cyrus Schwert 02:13:45 Please. Guys.
Cletus Cobbington 02:13:54 Oh shit, my bad, I was reading my character's name. I'm gonna smack him! Oh yes, oh yes. Please! Oh no! Oh okay, gotcha.
Dungeon Master 02:14:14 If you're rolling on the website, you can also just right click it and it'll let you roll with advantage like that. Well, 12 to hit, but go ahead and roll your bardic if you want to use it. You just need one, so you're going to get no matter what. The 8. Yeah, minimum, but.
Kaladen Shash 02:14:21 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:14:29 That's a d4, right? Oh shit, d8. Um... Boom. Well, I guess it's gonna get it no matter what, but, for funsies. Whoop. Ah ha ha! One again. Jesus.
Cyrus Schwert 02:14:31 Do it.
Dungeon Master 02:14:43 Up to 16, you hit. Come on. You can do it. No. It's so, so hurt. Roll me a D100, 90 or up. He's got a nut allergy.
Cletus Cobbington 02:14:58 What are the odds he has a nut allergy? Wait, why did that roll back? Are there D100s on this thing? Ah, there we go.
Kaladen Shash 02:15:02 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:15:10 Bye bye.
Dungeon Master 02:15:17 ID 100. Yeah, it's the 2D10s next week. No, OK, sorry, I'll up at the top room your turn.
Cletus Cobbington 02:15:30 No.
Zariel Torgan 02:15:39 Run it. Same thing, I'm gonna take a step back here, and I'm gonna do another Thorn Whip. Not necessarily, let's see. Well, I guess I'd have to, so yeah, sure.
Dungeon Master 02:15:53 Do you step out of its space? Yeah, OK, it'll not like it's going to hit, but I take an attack of opportunity. 15 misses. Go ahead and roll your thorn whip. 15 just hits.
Kaladen Shash 02:16:12 Do the same thing now that it's outside of melee. I'll cast this object blast again.
Zariel Torgan 02:16:12 Alright, I already did, it was a 15. Alright. It's gonna be 8 piercing damage, and he is pulled closer to me.
Dungeon Master 02:16:26 Okay. So hold up, set up for Kaladin to finish it off. Kaladin is your go. It looks incredibly hurt. Death's Door knocking swept the rug. 26 hits.
Cletus Cobbington 02:16:27 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 02:16:46 Oh yeah. That was a fantastic view.
Kaladen Shash 02:16:46 Excellent, I just I just step up and then swing. 26 to hit. But 17 of the really strong swing. With the thorn whip store, sort of like holding it down, I just lop its head right off.
Dungeon Master 02:16:58 Finish it. How does Kaladin kill this thing? Just another decapitation. Body hits the ground, squirts out like Blackacre, and appearing on the pedestal after a gold flash,
Kaladen Shash 02:17:12 And Maggie, you just got kind of a segmented body. So right where that little bulbous connection is, just choo. Wait.
Dungeon Master 02:17:28 goes through the room, you see an orb that has 1 on it. Down at the bottom, though, Cyrus, your turn. It's like the top half of your scimitar has been, like, melted away. 15 hits. 23 hits.
Cyrus Schwert 02:17:37 My sword's just getting chewed up. Five more. Oh, let's go.
Dungeon Master 02:17:57 And half to five, how do you want to do this?
Kaladen Shash 02:17:58 Did it.
Cletus Cobbington 02:18:03 What is that?
Cyrus Schwert 02:18:03 I... I've never done this before. I stab it, and then I see that it's dead, and I just fucking keep hitting it until I know for sure. Just, like, way overkill.
Dungeon Master 02:18:15 You see, like, this black liquid is just spraying up in Cletus's face. He's just getting slowly soaked as you stab over and over and over his body, just like turning to a pulpy pile. And then the pile sort of twitches a little bit and he starts stabbing it again, freaking out. You guys, that thing is dead. And in this room, you also see another
Leopold Magnus 02:18:15 Leopold Willis.
Dungeon Master 02:18:39 He pops up. This one's got the V with a one. This is mark number six.
Cyrus Schwert 02:18:47 I slayed my first beast. So... My hands are shaking hard. I've experienced great trauma. I'm an adventurer. It's okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:18:49 leopold will approach uh... saris uh... well well well well you know take it easy there champ i think i think you may have gotten it
Cletus Cobbington 02:19:07 to.
Zariel Torgan 02:19:08 Well.
Cyrus Schwert 02:19:18 I pick up the orb. I get it covered in black junk. Well, should we go back to the Nether? Is there any doors in this room? It's one we went through.
Dungeon Master 02:19:21 Okay, you pick up word number six. You guys have five, one, and six.
Zariel Torgan 02:19:45 We do we think they need to add up to something or
Kaladen Shash 02:19:50 10 total keys.
Dungeon Master 02:19:51 You're not really sure. This goes into another hallway that goes up and down. Up or down? Do the whole thing, make it easier. That goes to there.
Cyrus Schwert 02:19:59 Okay. We want to go through that. What do you think robots?
Cletus Cobbington 02:20:05 I'm gonna put my hands all up on that door. Or it's a hallway, I guess.
Dungeon Master 02:20:20 This goes to there.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:33 Yeah, let's proceed onwards. Up.
Cyrus Schwert 02:20:34 Bitcoin. Let's go up.
Cletus Cobbington 02:20:39 Up or down, robot?
Dungeon Master 02:20:50 Very funny that you went that way. It goes into the same room. You guys pop out to this large room and I'll explain what you see and then we'll transfer to the other group.
Dungeon Master 02:21:04 In this room, you see various weapon racks with all these old disheveled weapons. None are super impressive at first glance as you're sort of scanning the room. In the center of the room, or sort of center back, you see a statue of a knight with an outstretched hand and on it, a plaque in Sylvan. So if somebody has to speak Sylvan in your party, it reads something. Does somebody read Sylvan in this group?
Cletus Cobbington 02:21:10 Mm-mm.
Leopold Magnus 02:21:36 I certainly don't.
Cyrus Schwert 02:21:40 Yeah, actually, that's one of my... Can you say it again?
Cletus Cobbington 02:21:41 Oh, actually, I do speak Sylvan. Cletus is well versed in Lingo. I put an almond in his hand. No, I don't.
Kaladen Shash 02:21:42 Fires. Fires. Yeah, there you go.
Dungeon Master 02:21:50 both of you speak it love it uh it reads um bring me bring to me the greatest weapon that knights covet puts warriors to ruin and ends all battles yeah bring to me the great i'll just i'll copy and i'll put it in chat how about that
Zariel Torgan 02:22:22 people.
Dungeon Master 02:22:31 And I'll give you a chance to think on that for a second. At the top, you guys have this key that you just got. Where else would you like to go? Currently, it only looks like you have one door.
Kaladen Shash 02:22:50 Yes, we'll continue through what looks like our only path forward. You're talking like up here? Yeah, that's great. Can I scan the room for,
Zariel Torgan 02:22:54 Yeah, let's do it. Yeah, let's go.
Dungeon Master 02:23:04 You go into this room and you see there is just a key on a pedestal. This key is number two.
Cyrus Schwert 02:23:13 Let's fucking go!
Kaladen Shash 02:23:22 There doesn't appear to be any booby traps.
Dungeon Master 02:23:25 Give me a perception check, and then we'll go back to the bottom. What would you guys like to do in this room? Again, of all various types of weapons, there are swords, flails, maces, spears, bows, battle axes, anything you could think of weapon-wise.
Leopold Magnus 02:23:46 What's this say, guys? I didn't really understand the Sylvan writing. Ooh. They're all weapons, Jonathan?
Cletus Cobbington 02:23:57 It says, bring me blah, blah, blah, blah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:23:59 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:24:15 all sorts of weapons if you want to take a closer look uh you can give me like an investigation or perception check otherwise it's yeah just a room full of weapons natural 20 number eight of the night
Leopold Magnus 02:24:25 Yeah, I'll do a little investigation. Oh, National 20.
Cyrus Schwert 02:24:29 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 02:24:31 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:24:35 Uh, Leopold, you hear they explain it to you, and it takes you an instant. You're like, you hear this riddle, you look to your right at a certain weapon rack, and on it is a sword that looks a little bit newer, a little bit shinier. You walk over to it, you grab it, and sort of a layer of dust falls off, and it's this really beautiful silvered sword.
Kaladen Shash 02:24:35 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 02:24:58 and on it inscribed in sylvan you couldn't read it but to those who are next you could read it along the hand guard and then the sort of fuller of the blade it says peacemaker in sylvan and it's got an olive branch that sort of wraps around the handle this sword looks very important in this room
Kaladen Shash 02:25:10 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:25:12 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 02:25:21 I'll take it off the rack, I'll kind of blow the dust into the room and flip it a few times in my hand, catching it, sizing it up, and I'll walk over and place it as an offering.
Dungeon Master 02:25:38 Okay, you put it in the hand, you see the knight's hand closes around it in this what was an animated suit of armor that hadn't done anything yet goes into a rest at ease pose, sort of turns the sword upside down, puts it on the ground, doesn't like have a tight grip on it, but like is in like an at ease position and behind the knight, a door opens up and at the end of that is a pedestal with a key.
Cletus Cobbington 02:26:08 Hmm. I scoop it from Cyrus's grubby hands now. He has it.
Dungeon Master 02:26:10 Very nice natural 20. It's, it's like, it's got it like at its side, like it's technically in its grip, but you could probably like kick the point of the blade and have it sort of tilt out and you could pull the sword out at the end.
Leopold Magnus 02:26:13 Well, I don't have much use for this old shiny sword here, but maybe one of you folk can take it.
Cyrus Schwert 02:26:22 This stirred through the armor, like grabbed it, right? I would love to try to do that after we grab the thing. The key orb.
Dungeon Master 02:26:44 You grab this key at the very bottom of the hallway has I and X. It is number nine. You have the sword known as Peacemaker. I haven't made it yet, but this is currently a plus one sword.
Cletus Cobbington 02:26:48 Silence. Silence.
Cyrus Schwert 02:26:53 I'll try to take the sword out.
Dungeon Master 02:27:13 It has got the versatile weapon property, so it's strength or dex depending on how you want to use it. Technically a longsword, but it could have the finesse property because it's light, it's nice and small. And it's got some magical abilities that you don't know until you attune to it, but you don't need to attune to it to get the plus one bonus.
Cyrus Schwert 02:27:26 Okay. Got it. Sweet. Okay, so there's other doors in this big room. Looks like.
Dungeon Master 02:27:48 There is a door right here and a door right, well, when you get down here, this door doesn't really matter, but there is another hallway that goes through here just to complete it. Two different ways you can go. Group at the top, are you guys doing anything? You have two different doorways you can go.
Cletus Cobbington 02:28:08 Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:11 Uh, we got an 810. OK. Yeah, we just pick up the orb.
Dungeon Master 02:28:17 Oh, right. 18 and 10. 18, you look around, there's nothing in this room. 10, Zaria, you don't trust that pedestal.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:26 Interesting. All right, I'm gonna avoid it and then, what do you think, the door or the hall? All right, I'm gonna run over there, push the door open.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:44 Let us through the door very quickly. Let us see.
Dungeon Master 02:28:54 It goes into a hallway that opens up into another door. Okay, we'll come back to you guys in a second. Back at the bottom, you guys are going up or down? Down and then to this door. What is in here?
Zariel Torgan 02:29:01 I'm going to push through that.
Cletus Cobbington 02:29:04 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:29:14 We go down.
Leopold Magnus 02:29:17 Let's do it.
Dungeon Master 02:29:25 OK. I'm going to take a quick break. This will be another combat encounter for both of you. Yeah, I'm going to go smoke for a second, say hi to Hannah, and then I'll have you guys in my ear, but I'll be on mute, so I won't be saying anything.
Zariel Torgan 02:29:35 Uh, yeah. What do you think, like 5-10 minutes? Alright, sweet. I'll be back.
Kaladen Shash 02:29:36 OK. It's great so. Travis, what is your?
Kaladen Shash 02:30:05 What is your character? Are you just a fighter? Okay. So you guys are both boards that I was picking up. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:30:08 I'm a College of Swords Bard. Yeah. So, uh, they, um, Druid. Circle of Shepherds Druid.
Cletus Cobbington 02:30:29 Hm. Yep. You get a bunch of animal-based things and proficiencies, but you get wild shape improvements and spirit totems. Yeah. I don't have anything in the fun stuff yet, but.
Leopold Magnus 02:30:30 Circle of Shepherds, what does that do?
Kaladen Shash 02:30:34 I guess it lets you conjure a ton of creatures and stuff. Man, that's how I feel.
Cyrus Schwert 02:31:00 I said, yeah. Out of doing any class with Paladin, to have Smites,
Kaladen Shash 02:31:02 I'm at 7, but I'm multi classing, so I'm at 4 fighter and 3 wizard. So for being 7, it feels like I'm too far along for not having like great stuff yet. What's up? Yeah, that's. I was going to say that that's a great way to add a lot to a punch.
Cletus Cobbington 02:31:07 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 02:31:16 I feel that, yeah. That's what that multiclass will do to you.
Kaladen Shash 02:31:32 Jonathan was doing that in our last campaign when Jesse was leading it. And he would add like a smite and get like all kinds of, he'd be like plus 48, like craziness. We'd be like, all right, man.
Cyrus Schwert 02:31:37 Yeah. What is it? What was it multiclassed with?
Leopold Magnus 02:31:56 Yeah, Jonathan's last character was insane. He'd do a lot of damage. I don't even know, he had like three maybe in there?
Cletus Cobbington 02:32:01 Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 02:32:09 Bard, yes, yeah, it was like Bard, Paladin. And something else maybe. Wasn't just fighter. Everybody is a pirate. Any? So it will be critted, then it added extra damage because you know you picked in some sort of like you know.
Cyrus Schwert 02:32:19 Gotcha.
Leopold Magnus 02:32:25 He would just be like, and I'm going to do this, and I'm going to do that, and I'm going to do, and then it was just like massive damage. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:32:37 Bye.
Kaladen Shash 02:32:40 some feat that made him add stuff for getting crits. It's like silly. I usually try not to multi-class, but it's made it too good just to run it all the way up to 20. You get so many perks when you hit those last two levels.
Cyrus Schwert 02:32:51 Yeah, I don't do too much min-maxing. Haven't yet. Yeah. Yeah, usually you don't know if you're going to make it to level 20. But with this, you kind of know
Leopold Magnus 02:33:04 Yeah. I just wanted to be more wizard-like. That's a good point. I mean, that's, yeah, it's a huge commitment.
Cyrus Schwert 02:33:21 groups established, you're going to make it and keep playing. So not that many tables really play a whole three levels.
Kaladen Shash 02:33:26 Yeah, it's nice. No, I just. It's been really consistent. It's been pretty rad. No, it no, I ended up being. I think we ended up playing just over like a year and nine months to finish the campaign.
Leopold Magnus 02:33:38 Well, the last campaign we played, Bryn, was like, what, two years, three years? Okay. I wasn't sure how long you guys had played before I joined in. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:33:57 I don't think we were more than maybe like. 10 or 15. I don't like this like we're 20 or today. No. It is not. It's not often.
Leopold Magnus 02:34:09 But still, I mean, playing every week for that long, that's crazy, I mean.
Cyrus Schwert 02:34:15 Yeah. Yeah, our first one went like two and a half years. But we didn't play every week. It was pretty sporadic. We were all in school and everything. So we basically leveled up like every session because we played so infrequently. We'd play for like eight hours or something every time.
Kaladen Shash 02:34:29 Yeah, it makes it a lot harder. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:34:41 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:34:41 OK. I feel like we do a good blend of like play every week and then get together for a weekend here and there and play for long.
Cyrus Schwert 02:35:07 This thing makes it pretty nice to play online, though. Yeah. Yeah, I've never played just online.
Kaladen Shash 02:35:11 It the visuals there. The rolling is kind of fun, so everyone's got like a log. It's really pretty good. Like this is a pretty generic map.
Cletus Cobbington 02:35:12 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:35:22 It's I like playing in person, but you get a lot of cool benefits of having that map there and all that cool stuff. So it makes playing online pretty fun. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that was wild.
Kaladen Shash 02:35:38 Like some of the ones Jesse found had moving components. So trees would gently sway if you were in a forest map. Pretty good. It seems like lately we've been playing three, three and a half hours.
Cyrus Schwert 02:35:38 Yeah. How long do we usually play at a time?
Kaladen Shash 02:36:06 Usually our sessions like start. At 730 that writer 7 when we usually start Rex. I'm 30, yeah. Yeah. This is really crawly.
Leopold Magnus 02:36:14 I think, yeah, closer to 730, but in there, yeah. And then three and a half hours is like, if I remember the recording length is generally the average.
Cyrus Schwert 02:36:30 This thing's pretty crawly. We haven't even gotten hit yet. Yeah. Did you actually roll your HP dice, like your health die? Trace, did you roll your health dice? Or did you actually roll 38?
Cletus Cobbington 02:36:36 Yeah, I Panicked right when we started because I looked and I had like my level three or level two health and I was like, oh
Kaladen Shash 02:36:36 I was gonna say, we've taken no damage, we just need to keep raiding these rooms. Got a walking tank. This is our first crawl with Jonathan. What's that?
Leopold Magnus 02:36:44 I think this is our first proper dungeon though. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:37:06 You can change it. As I say, you can change it anytime. Yeah, it was too bad.
Cletus Cobbington 02:37:06 We're going to roll real quick. Oh, yeah. I did when the summaries and first thing was happening. And then I was like, OK, but now I'm first up to talk. We got to roll these quick. Did get those. I always play such. Really?
Cyrus Schwert 02:37:26 Yeah, when I played as Ratchet, we didn't even fight. It was just all dialogue, which was kind of nice because I did not know how to play a cleric.
Kaladen Shash 02:37:37 We get a good blend of like putzing around or like trying to solve a mystery and now it's just crawl. This is nice. Well. What was that guy's name? He betrayed us. Is that who you played? Is that what you guys want? John fucking asshole.
Leopold Magnus 02:37:49 Clerics are fun. I played one for a brief period when my character was temporarily dead. Don Drux, yeah. Yeah, yeah. That was also fun, because I got to be evil for like a couple of sessions. Yeah, yeah. You never want to like be super evil as like your main character, because it's just not productive. But temporary one was pretty sweet.
Kaladen Shash 02:38:08 That was good, yeah. I'm sure it's fun.
Cletus Cobbington 02:38:13 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:38:25 The spirit guardians thing, that's wicked. I just got that.
Kaladen Shash 02:38:35 I'm going to feel pretty happy with my attack ability once I've got my second attack unlocked. Yeah, it's going to be a nice look for some of that class thing is to go text. There you go.
Dungeon Master 02:38:45 Okay. I was a bard, 7 paladin, 7 fighter, 6. I could do, if you crit... Yeah, if I crit and I did a 4th level smite, it was...
Leopold Magnus 02:38:56 OK. And you also came in.
Cyrus Schwert 02:39:01 That's it. Just stick into the classic. Yeah, flourishes.
Dungeon Master 02:39:11 4d8 times no it was like 5d8 doubled so it's 10d8 plus 2d8 for my rapier uh the bard travis you can do this as a college of swords you can do like pushing to flourishes or mobile flourishes you can just add damage or and then like add to your ac depending on the dice so that was doubled so that was 2d8 and then i also as a fighter
Dungeon Master 02:39:38 I took a feat at some point for more maneuvers. So I also had a pushing attack. So I had a D6 that I doubled too. So I think the highest I ever did was on a crit and then a bunch of other stuff. I had 28 D8 plus like 70 or something. It was like my tour. I was fighting the Demogorgon. Jesse put me up against a Demogorgon by myself.
Cletus Cobbington 02:39:57 Jesus.
Dungeon Master 02:40:07 And so I was in this little pocket dimension fighting a CR30 monster. And I was like, OK, you want to see what my character can do? And then as a fighter, you get action surge. So I had three attacks, action surge, three attacks.
Kaladen Shash 02:40:15 Yeah. That's a good point.
Leopold Magnus 02:40:17 Held its own, for sure. I guess the nice thing about that, too, is you gotta re-roll your character late-game so you don't have to sit through the pain of slowly multi-classing.
Cyrus Schwert 02:40:26 Yeah, it's crazy. Yeah, any kind of character that just like,
Cletus Cobbington 02:40:38 I'm
Dungeon Master 02:40:38 Once I got bored with the barbarian and I was like, that's been fun. I wanted to make a broken character. So I've never done that. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:40:56 Swings and acts only. After years like every week. OK, with your own.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:01 You never would. I kill all characters. I think Ralph has a little bit of a speed.
Dungeon Master 02:41:01 Gets old. Yeah. So I got after like a year of playing it, I had, uh, I asked Jesse if, if he killed my character, but not take it easy, don't pull any punches. And he killed me. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:41:17 Yeah, you did a pretty good job with my heart. I think Jesse has a TV on in the background, yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:41:17 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:41:30 What is that noise? We all back? We all ready?
Zariel Torgan 02:41:31 Oh, hang on.
Kaladen Shash 02:41:42 The dogs like to look. All back, ready for encounters.
Cyrus Schwert 02:41:42 You're going to say something before.
Dungeon Master 02:41:58 Grace, you're at your HP. I heard you guys talking about that. Did you remember to re-roll? I didn't tell you this, so it's hard for you to remember it. Did you re-roll ones on HP dice? Perfect, OK. OK.
Cletus Cobbington 02:42:04 Yeah, I had rolled it right as we were getting started. Yeah, I don't know if I even got anyone.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:26 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:42:26 Um, and then, oh, this was for Bren, Jesse, and Rex, because I couldn't remember. When you guys started out at level one, did I have you, like, double your HP to start with? Like, your first number was doubled or something? Okay. So, for sure then, Travis and Trace, like, whatever your hit die is to start with, you get max HP at first level, so just add another hit dice worth of
Kaladen Shash 02:42:40 Yes. First number was doubled, yep.
Cletus Cobbington 02:42:40 What if I get a one?
Dungeon Master 02:42:56 hit points so if it's like a d6 or a d8 at that you just get the max number because at level one it should have been double no like whatever your hit die is as a druid just add that number so if you have a d8 at eight don't roll it yeah because at level one you would have had max hp and then i doubled it because the party was smaller but i want you guys to be on par with them still
Cyrus Schwert 02:43:08 Oh, that's nice. Sounds good.
Cletus Cobbington 02:43:12 Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
Dungeon Master 02:43:28 And then go ahead and roll initiative. We're going to do. I'm in one more combat. We can call it good for the night. And I think after this you guys will have a chance to talk if you just don't want to do any fighting and he'll hit a wall.
Leopold Magnus 02:43:35 Yeah, that sounds good.
Zariel Torgan 02:43:37 Yeah, sounds fair.
Cletus Cobbington 02:43:52 Don't shoot.
Dungeon Master 02:44:08 What you guys see as you each enter your rooms respectively. Um? Both of your rooms lit up when I found everything. Hmm. I didn't hear that Travis, sorry.
Cyrus Schwert 02:44:18 Is that sort of? It would just not be able to. I'm going to turn it off so it stops slagging. Go ahead.
Dungeon Master 02:44:44 Oh, I just didn't know if you said something. At the top, Kaladin and Zariel, you see this creature, this like grotesque, monstrous bird looks like it had been waiting like it wasn't in like this gross cocoon. It was like on the ceiling and it drops down in the center of the room at the bottom. The rest of the party sees.
Cyrus Schwert 02:44:47 No, it's okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:44:52 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:45:15 this creature, little impish reptilian looking kind of fiend. And yeah, it looks right at you, Cletus. And he goes, hey, fuck you, man. Caledon, you're first up to act.
Cletus Cobbington 02:45:21 Gremlin ass. Chip flips him off.
Kaladen Shash 02:45:38 All from a range, I'll go ahead and cast this object blast at it. First one is going to be a 21. Second one, these are rolling really slow. 19. Last one. And then it looks like a.
Cyrus Schwert 02:45:39 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:45:54 21 hits. 19 hits. 14 misses. Oh, yes, 14 misses.
Kaladen Shash 02:46:09 14 Alright, so here's the damage on that. 18 forced. The the that's been rolled pretty good. The damage I said didn't good. And then I'll I'll close my bonus section and then I'll use my movement.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:10 So pretty good Goddamn
Dungeon Master 02:46:25 18 good roll. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:46:28 Nice. Bonus action.
Kaladen Shash 02:46:43 I won't be able to. Oh no, 3030 feet gets me right up to it. And then I'll I'll use light bringer or light splitter.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:46 I would be inside, I just stopped there because we hadn't opened the door so I would be like another fight.
Dungeon Master 02:47:03 Now remind me, because we went through this before, everybody in the party is like immune to poison, correct? And your math is on. Okay. What about the poison condition? I'm pretty sure Kaladin is immune to being poisoned. Do you have any immunities at all?
Kaladen Shash 02:47:11 I am when I have my mask on. Masked on. I'm going to click on the saving thing. Let me see if it expands.
Leopold Magnus 02:47:13 resistant to poison, not immune.
Zariel Torgan 02:47:16 Yeah, I'm resistant to.
Kaladen Shash 02:47:43 You know, just the weapon Breath of Dragons and something else against being charmed. It's just defenses. It's immunity to magical sleep, but resistance to fire and poison. I don't know about effects. They're just resistance.
Dungeon Master 02:47:55 So just, just resistance. Okay. Yes. When you hit this creature with an attack, what's different about it is like at impact, you see this cloud of like green, hazy, uh, like spores explode off of its body and hits you in the area. Give me a, uh, constitution saving throw.
Kaladen Shash 02:48:13 17. And then does it 15 hit? OK. And this will be the damage from the sword.
Dungeon Master 02:48:27 17 succeeds. You are not poisoned. Perfect. 15. Hold on. Does hit. 15 exactly hits. 10 points of damage. Good round. 30-something damage. Perfect.
Kaladen Shash 02:48:43 10. Wrong round.
Cyrus Schwert 02:48:46 Nice round.
Dungeon Master 02:48:57 38, I think. Leopold, you're up after that. Yeah, until people filter in. The only person who would be at this point would be Cyrus would be in the room.
Cletus Cobbington 02:48:58 you.
Leopold Magnus 02:49:03 Excellent. Interesting, so I am stuck out in this hallway then I can't really do much, can I? Can I? I just hold my action. I don't. I don't know if that's possible or not.
Cyrus Schwert 02:49:17 Peace.
Dungeon Master 02:49:34 Yeah, you could hold your action for if that changes. Like if they move into the space and give you an opening, you could do something then. So you'll be, I would say, as far in as you can to see these creatures there. No, he's just invisible. Just so he's not crowding up the screen.
Cletus Cobbington 02:49:39 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:49:41 OK. And then did my defender go down? OK, that's fine. So I'll just hold up, hold an action, and hope that I can get in there and kick some ass once they make way. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:50:04 Okay, I assume you do the same thing for your defender. Beautiful. At the top, not top, at initiative count 14 is this creature called the Vrak. It is going to take some attacks at you, Kaladin. But before that, you hear it emits this horrific guttural screech, I need both Kaladin and Zariel to give me a con save.
Kaladen Shash 02:50:33 I know his cons. That's softer, 13. That's not what we need.
Dungeon Master 02:50:37 They just all do con. 10. 13. You are both stunned. It will then take its attacks at advantage on you, Kaladin.
Cyrus Schwert 02:50:47 Oh no.
Zariel Torgan 02:50:50 Yeah, not great.
Dungeon Master 02:51:04 First one kind of soft 19 to hit. First one hits. It takes one beat one talent. Allen. Is a natural 20 so that hits? Yeah. And then.
Kaladen Shash 02:51:09 It's worse than this. Get out of here.
Dungeon Master 02:51:34 So that'll be 2d6, and then the other one is 2d10, which becomes 4d10. Plus 9. You take 48 points of damage. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:51:42 Oh. My God.
Zariel Torgan 02:51:46 Oof.
Kaladen Shash 02:51:53 You rolled that well. Rolled that well, Sir. And then what are the rules for breaking this done? Just roll a save or get take damage or what?
Cletus Cobbington 02:51:59 Jesus.
Dungeon Master 02:52:00 Thanks. Okay, and then the exact wording of it is, each creature within the 40 feet of it can hear it, and that isn't a demon, must exceed a DC 14 Kong save or be stunned until the end of its next turn.
Dungeon Master 02:52:21 it is just an ability it's a once per day thing so there is no get out of this early it's till the end of its next turn like yeah like a monk so you are stunned at after that early as
Kaladen Shash 02:52:27 Just one round. OK.
Zariel Torgan 02:52:37 Yeah, I'll just chill.
Dungeon Master 02:52:40 little gremlin ass creatures called closets. Uh, the other one behind the one that said, fuck you, like gets up on his guy's back and he says, Hey, no, fuck you. And they both charge in one at a time. Uh, we'll take attack on you, Cyrus. The 14 hit.
Cyrus Schwert 02:52:58 Yeah. It does not. Oh.
Cletus Cobbington 02:53:04 Don't touch my gaunt boy.
Dungeon Master 02:53:11 And that is all it does. Second one. Sprint in. This was the softer run between the two. But it'll also take an attack on you. A 21 to hit.
Cyrus Schwert 02:53:34 Yeah, definitely. Oh my fucking God. Please. No. Oh, let's go.
Cletus Cobbington 02:53:36 All right, you can touch them. Wow.
Dungeon Master 02:53:37 You take 6 piercing damage and give me a con-saving throw. And it's exactly what you need. You are not poisoned and take 6 piercing damage.
Zariel Torgan 02:54:01 Oh, nice.
Dungeon Master 02:54:03 You see this little thing says, hey, fuck you. And the first attack is pretty soft. And the second one, it hits him. It like really gets infected looking instantly on his arm. Just as soon as it gets it, it looks really bad.
Cletus Cobbington 02:54:09 Let's see You know, there's not too much I could do
Cyrus Schwert 02:54:15 What the fuck? Oh!
Cletus Cobbington 02:54:40 All right, let's slap this little fucker that just slapped my boy. Come on. 12 damage.
Dungeon Master 02:54:58 12 damage. You see you're slowly you hit one on the head and it hits it so hard that you cave in its skull. And then you're slowly your staff slides down and hits the other one doing a significant amount of damage to the other way like breaks a rib. And it's like, you've killed one and one is very hurt.
Cletus Cobbington 02:55:17 Oh, wow. Okay. That'd be me.
Dungeon Master 02:55:25 After that Cyrus, it is your turn. This thing is in front of you. The other one is dead and it looks very hurt. Swing. 11. Misses. 27 natural 20 hits.
Cyrus Schwert 02:55:32 Uh, I watched, he had caved in in one hit, so I'm just gonna go nuts and swing at him. Fuck. Swing twice. Boom! My old scimitar, yes. Yeah, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:55:53 Yeah, there you go. Well, new magical plus one. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:55:53 Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:55:54 Are you still using your busted up sword or are you using the new one? 15, how do you want to kill this thing? That is 9 in natural 20, 10 total. Both of these little fucks are dead, you see. Another key.
Cyrus Schwert 02:56:07 I just sliced its head off. I'm obviously slightly getting this. Just had to look around. I'm getting pretty good at this, huh, guys?
Dungeon Master 02:56:23 pops up on the pedestal there. This one has got eight written on it. Covered in black ichor and blood. Little scroll gives you like a nice nod.
Cletus Cobbington 02:56:31 Chip daps you up.
Cyrus Schwert 02:56:50 I feel a part of the floor.
Dungeon Master 02:56:54 back up at the top since we're still in combat initiative. Actually, at the end of your turn, Cyrus, because you get a nat 20, we'll reward it a little bit more. Give me a perception check with advantage.
Cletus Cobbington 02:57:09 Silence.
Cyrus Schwert 02:57:21 Sounds like they're fighting something too.
Dungeon Master 02:57:24 20 you hear like at like right at the start of your turn you catch the the sound of like a horrifying loud screech and you can just tell that the other party members are currently in a fight whether or not you do something about that's up to you but you have heard them now that your fight is done but you have movement on your turn
Dungeon Master 02:57:53 Since we're still in combat, you can go somewhere. I didn't get a lot of that.
Cyrus Schwert 02:58:01 Um, we heard anything or. Has to think that it would be gone. Sorry, have we heard anything in our, like, reports for that kind of thing. And make us think that, like, something's going wrong.
Cletus Cobbington 02:58:03 you
Dungeon Master 02:58:23 It's not your fault. Oh, would you guys have said something? Oh, yeah, physically you're stunned, but you have mental fortitude still. You guys get stunned, and you can let them know that you are, like, both incapable of moving.
Kaladen Shash 02:58:32 I'm stunned. The silence. Yeah, fair enough.
Zariel Torgan 02:58:34 Yeah, we're we're still standing Yeah, I probably say like fuck stand
Cletus Cobbington 02:58:36 No, no.
Cyrus Schwert 02:58:48 You got stunned and took 48 damage. I guess I can still take a guess. Can I get past these guys in the hallway, though? Probably not, right?
Dungeon Master 02:58:58 really far away from them. You can move through when you're not in combat, even though we're in combat order, you guys aren't fighting. When you're not in combat, you can move through your party members at no extra movement. You can just get slight passed.
Kaladen Shash 02:59:03 very far.
Cyrus Schwert 02:59:26 That's true. Back where we came. I feel like if we go forwards, we'll just run into more shit. We don't really know where we are in relation. So I had to start running back because we heard they're stunned.
Cletus Cobbington 02:59:38 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:59:40 Okay. Kaladin, you were stunned on your turn. Is there anything that you can do... Like, I'd let you, like, act... Not action surge, but, like, second wind if you wanted to. Like, things that don't actually require you to move or do something.
Kaladen Shash 03:00:01 That's fine. I'll do that. It's still it's technically a bonus action. I think with stunned I can't take any of those actions.
Dungeon Master 03:00:12 Oh, is second one a bonus action? Okay, yeah. Then you are just stunned. Leopold, it is your turn. Yeah, so how that does work, and so you would have a chance to do that, if by the end of combat order, the thing that you're waiting for doesn't happen, you can use it to do whatever you want instead.
Leopold Magnus 03:00:18 OK. Well, I guess since I held my action, can I use that to run an extra bit? Got it.
Cyrus Schwert 03:00:26 Oh, there you go.
Dungeon Master 03:00:40 like right before cyrus killed it you could have said i want to move backwards and that would have worked so you go ahead and move your movement forward to start the turn and then you can move again nice
Leopold Magnus 03:00:51 OK, and then I will also cast Expeditious Retreat, which you take the dash action. And until the spell ends, you can't. I guess that doesn't make sense. And until the spell ends, you can take. Oh, OK, OK. So I'll cast that. So that'll be my dash, and then I'll
Cyrus Schwert 03:00:57 Nice.
Dungeon Master 03:01:15 So you can move action dash, bonus action dash again. Yes. You can do that for 100 combat rounds, 60 combat rounds, whatever the fuck it is. Crazy amount. OK, so what is your movement then if you can do, is your movement 30? So you can do 90 feet in a round.
Leopold Magnus 03:01:20 Yes. And the spell lasts for 10 minutes, so I can do that on my next turn as well. So. Yeah. So. Yeah, 30 feet. OK. So.
Cletus Cobbington 03:01:31 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 03:01:49 It's almost direct path. So I'll move here for 30 feet. And then 20 feet. OK, so that's 50 here. And then 90.
Kaladen Shash 03:01:55 That long zigzag hallway hurts.
Cyrus Schwert 03:01:57 That's fine.
Dungeon Master 03:02:00 I'm going to say you could have put your Steel Defender away and so he'll just get with you. While he's doing that, Zariel... Not Zariel, the Brock is up then. So while Leopold moves, this thing is going to go again. I'm going to check its intelligence. If it is...
Dungeon Master 03:02:24 Not above a certain number, it'll just attack Kaladin because he's right there. But if it's smart, it will go and split it to Zarya. It's an 11. I'm saying it's just going to attack Kaladin, who's right in front of it. That is a 19 to hit.
Leopold Magnus 03:02:35 I'm actually going to. Here.
Cletus Cobbington 03:02:43 you
Kaladen Shash 03:02:46 All right, let's go. Just barely hits the end, yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 03:02:57 Yes.
Dungeon Master 03:03:00 You take 10 points of damage. And it'll take its Talon attack on you. That is a 23. That hits. You take 15 points of slashing damage. Still up?
Cyrus Schwert 03:03:30 Oof.
Kaladen Shash 03:03:31 So yeah, man, of course it's a lot. Come on.
Dungeon Master 03:03:33 That's its turn. It only can do that screech thing once, so at the end of its turn, you lose your stun condition, but more importantly, before his turn, Zariel, you have your turn because the stun ends before your turn starts.
Cletus Cobbington 03:03:37 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 03:03:52 All right, first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna run up and I'm gonna get around the side of this creature here so I can flank with Kaladin, hopefully. And as a bonus action, I'm gonna cast Healing Spirit, which can heal a d6 up to five times. Let's see, it's a bonus action. So,
Cletus Cobbington 03:04:11 today.
Dungeon Master 03:04:19 What's a space? Yeah, just a space.
Zariel Torgan 03:04:21 Uh, it's a five foot space. Or you mean range or space? Oh yeah, five foot. And so it can do 1D6, uh, five times. Let's see. Anytime it's first in the space of the creature or, um,
Zariel Torgan 03:04:47 When it starts its turn there, it takes a d6. So right off the bat, you get a d6 Kaladin, and then when you start your turn again, you'll get another d6. And then with my action, I'm going to... Let's see... I'm gonna turn into a bear. I'm gonna transform into my metallic bear form. But that's my action and bonus and movement, so I don't have anything else after that.
Dungeon Master 03:04:52 Okay. Okay. Let me get a bear token.
Cletus Cobbington 03:05:00 Well.
Cyrus Schwert 03:05:07 Let's
Dungeon Master 03:05:32 Okay. Letus, your turn. Yes, Cyrus has run ahead and Leopold granted. Oh, Kaladin, did you heal instantly? Yeah, go ahead.
Cletus Cobbington 03:05:38 Okay. Cyrus has run ahead from me, right? Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 03:05:45 yeah they're like back where we
Kaladen Shash 03:05:55 I guess 1D6 I was going to roll it, yeah. We're just being in the in the space. Not bad.
Dungeon Master 03:06:03 Yeah, as soon as you hit it for the first time you get to roll. Okay. Okay, Cletus continue. Nice.
Cletus Cobbington 03:06:10 okay well okay um i want to cast long strider on myself first level i would have put it on mr cyrus but he's away from me um then we're just gonna start running so that adds another 10 feet so i now i have 40 feet
Zariel Torgan 03:06:13 Night.
Dungeon Master 03:06:37 40 feet, perfect. Was that a bonus action or action again?
Cletus Cobbington 03:06:43 All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, full dash. It's an action.
Cyrus Schwert 03:06:48 You can go 80 if you fold. Oh, true. Never mind. All right, then I'm just using my full.
Dungeon Master 03:07:04 Sweet, okay. Cyrus, your turn. You are up. Okay. Did you, like, wanna set, like, cause you didn't set your spells beforehand, right? Or did you?
Cyrus Schwert 03:07:17 I don't think I have any spells or anything, so you could just. Excellent. The sets just weren't applicable to this, but it's all good.
Dungeon Master 03:07:41 Okay. Kaladin, you have your turn. The start of your turn you get another d6.
Kaladen Shash 03:07:49 We go and do that first. Take it. I will. Or use my bonus action to go ahead and do second wind. I think it's a.
Cletus Cobbington 03:07:50 you.
Zariel Torgan 03:08:03 Nice.
Kaladen Shash 03:08:21 1D templates for you. That's right, so six more. And then I'll use my action to go ahead and take an attack.
Kaladen Shash 03:08:50 That'll be with advantage right blanking there. Oh, it doesn't hit. No 17, that was a seven down there. That's great. Well, little days still got it for eight.
Dungeon Master 03:08:54 Yeah. Get advantage on that. 17 does hit. 8 still damage.
Kaladen Shash 03:09:20 I'm going to go ahead and. I'm going to action surge. Uh. I'm going to go ahead and cast a. Mirror image. And then I'll use the bonus action to go ahead and manipulate a potion.
Dungeon Master 03:09:28 Nice action surge it up. OK. I like it.
Kaladen Shash 03:09:54 We've got a couple of graders. That's great. There we go, 13 more. All right, that's all right.
Dungeon Master 03:10:11 off role. Okay, Leopold, your turn.
Leopold Magnus 03:10:20 All right, I'm coming as fast as I can, 90 feet at a time.
Dungeon Master 03:10:37 Wherever you move that then, your defender's going with you. It is this Brock's turn. Not as easy now. It'll do one attack on each of you. So first attack will be against the bear. That'll be its beak. That misses. Talon attack against Kaladin.
Dungeon Master 03:11:09 that misses. Okay. Dario, your turn. As soon as you guys are not stunned, I can't do shit.
Zariel Torgan 03:11:22 alright as a bonus action I can move as soon as I can I can move the thing as a bonus action so I'm gonna move it 30 feet 15 away and then 15 back to Kaladin so he gets another six because it enters his space again and then I'm gonna take two attacks as a bear so that's gonna be... do I have advantage?
Dungeon Master 03:11:42 Nice. Yes. 21 hit.
Cletus Cobbington 03:11:47 Who?
Zariel Torgan 03:11:54 All right, so I'm gonna take a bite first with advantage. That's a 21 for the first, oh, should've just rolled advantage. Okay, so yeah, we'll take the 21. And then for the claw, we're gonna go again. It's gonna be a dirty 20. All right, so that's gonna be 11 piercing damage on the bite.
Dungeon Master 03:12:16 2 and 20 hits.
Zariel Torgan 03:12:24 and 11 slashing damage on the claws. And then Kaladin, you can roll that d6 now if you want. All right, sweet. So that should be three, right? So there's still two more. All right.
Kaladen Shash 03:12:37 I did, I got a four on that. Yep. Yep.
Dungeon Master 03:12:48 Gotcha, gotcha. Hey Cletus low running, but you guys ever test the run up. This thing is not looking great. It is hurt. OK, Cyrus also running back up to the top. Then it's going to be Caledon.
Cletus Cobbington 03:12:57 I'm ruining. Right? I mean, that's the only thing we're doing here.
Kaladen Shash 03:13:11 Uh, yeah, I'm gonna. I'm gonna go ahead and step backwards, perhaps provoking an attack or actually not. It's about a section. Yeah, I'll just step backwards. OK, perfect. Roll that real quick. Sorry, I just picked up one healing, but that's great. Still one.
Zariel Torgan 03:13:22 You also get another d6 at the start of your turn.
Dungeon Master 03:13:32 It misses on its attack against you as you step back. 19 hits.
Kaladen Shash 03:13:40 And then we're going to go. Three isopric blasts. First one's rolling. Here it comes. Looks like it'll hit 19. Second one misses. Third one misses too.
Cyrus Schwert 03:13:53 Yep.
Dungeon Master 03:14:05 Yes, sir. Okay, one hit though.
Kaladen Shash 03:14:13 One hit here comes. And then I'll. I'll surge forward. And do an attack with advantage.
Kaladen Shash 03:14:44 I think that hits 19. Alright, good job. White splitter for 12.
Dungeon Master 03:14:45 19 hits. 12 damage. Looking very hurt. End of your turn. Leopold. You're still running.
Leopold Magnus 03:15:09 I'm coming!
Dungeon Master 03:15:14 I'm just going to go to this creature. Looking Panic, it's not looking good. It on its turn will do... We'll see if it gets this ability back. On a six it does. I need both Zariel and Kaladin give me a con save.
Kaladen Shash 03:15:34 Uh. You're all so good. Oh, that's OK, that's better. Almost in that 20. Yikes.
Dungeon Master 03:15:49 Natural 1. Okay. Zarul, you are poisoned if you can be. I don't know about Warforged. But you also, you take 1d10 poison damage at the start of its turn. So on your turn, you'll take 3 damage. But it will take... So yeah, you'll take 1 point. It'll take 2 attacks on Kaladin, because you're looking more hurt. And it is very desperate.
Zariel Torgan 03:15:49 Natural one. I'm resistant, so I'll take one.
Dungeon Master 03:16:23 That'll be a 25 to hit. And a 25 to hit. Two natural 19s on both of those. Six piercing damage. And 15 slashing damage.
Kaladen Shash 03:16:27 Of course it does. I can't even shield that. Yeah, one of them. One of them hits. Yeah, they both hit.
Cletus Cobbington 03:16:45 Okay.
Dungeon Master 03:16:52 Soriel, it is your go.
Zariel Torgan 03:16:58 Alright, I'll do the same thing as my bonus action. I'll move it away and move it back in so that he gets another d6 and with that the spiritual guardian will disappear or the healing spirit will disappear. And then I will take two attacks again on this creature as a bear. Let's see here, that's gonna be a 17 on the bite.
Cyrus Schwert 03:17:00 It's a good run.
Kaladen Shash 03:17:19 reach.
Dungeon Master 03:17:27 hits. Obviously hits. These guys are going to have spent their entire combat running this thing. You guys are going to kill it. Oh, that's, that's doubled.
Zariel Torgan 03:17:27 And a natural 20 on the claw. So that's going to be. It's going to be 12 on the. The fight for piercing and then that's going to be. Let's see this 30 then. On the slashing damage.
Zariel Torgan 03:17:58 Yeah. Yeah. All right. He's been... Oh, that's funny. All right, so yeah. I'll see it just beating up and beating up and beating up on Kaladin. And I've taken one hit point, and that's as a bear. And so I will angrily reach out and I'll just rip its wings off.
Dungeon Master 03:17:59 So it's 15 doubled. Okay, well how do you want to finish it? It had two hit points after this last thing.
Kaladen Shash 03:18:03 Yes.
Dungeon Master 03:18:32 of rock. Wings ripped off, Black Ichor just sort of exploding out of its back, lets out like a pained whine as it falls limp and dead. Everybody is effectively out of combat.
Leopold Magnus 03:18:49 Leopold comes sprinting in twice as regular speed. I'm here. I'm here. Let me, let me. And then just collapses stiffly, falls over like a board.
Cyrus Schwert 03:18:49 That's 10.
Cletus Cobbington 03:18:50 Silence.
Dungeon Master 03:19:17 That's on you guys. Cletus and Cyrus, you would run in and see that there is a giant metallic bear in the place of where Zariel normally is. And you see that Kaladin looks insanely hurt. But beyond that, there's nothing in this room. Give me an animal handling check.
Cyrus Schwert 03:19:19 Let's go.
Cletus Cobbington 03:19:41 I perform an animal handling check. With advantage or? No, okay. Oh, I needed it. Dirty. 20. I check for its tender spots.
Dungeon Master 03:19:49 Yeah, you know, it's advantage. You get the point. Jesse's ariel, you see this cow person sort of walking up and like goes to grab this the soft part of your metal body.
Zariel Torgan 03:20:17 I just, in his head, I just said, hey, fuck off, get off of me. Turned back into, I turned back into Zariel. Hey, get off me, dude. Get off. I turned back and you, you know, I turned back and you just got a handful of thighs.
Cletus Cobbington 03:20:22 Are you okay, gentle creature? I'm just touching a real weird part. Oh, my bad. Extreme inner thigh. Oh, pardon me. Thought you were a gentle creature.
Kaladen Shash 03:20:31 Just a creature eager to kill us.
Dungeon Master 03:20:32 It's like not his groin, but it's like the top of his thigh. There does not appear to be a key in this room, no.
Cyrus Schwert 03:20:36 I make it there too. Who's the president?
Zariel Torgan 03:20:47 Do we not get a key from killing this thing? Do we know which ones we have already?
Dungeon Master 03:21:04 You guys did get two free keys on the way in, though. I can tell you. Currently, you have, I believe, 5, 1, 6, 2, 9, and 8.
Cletus Cobbington 03:21:27 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 03:21:28 See the numbers we have again? All right, all right, one more, we got that.
Cyrus Schwert 03:21:31 That is shit.
Zariel Torgan 03:21:35 516298. Yeah, it's not bad.
Dungeon Master 03:21:40 You have 516298. There are six that you found. There are four to be found. Up to that point, though, at the top of this room there is. A locked door, but this door.
Dungeon Master 03:22:07 Hold on, let me get that away, let me get that away. There are six locks, seven.
Cletus Cobbington 03:22:11 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 03:22:15 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 03:22:34 It's a I wrote it backwards for some reason. There are seven locks on this door stacked perfectly on top of each other, one after the other. And each one has some writing next to it, but depending on. The language you can't read some of them potentially. The first lock everybody can read, because in common it says open. The second lock who speaks Elvish.
Cyrus Schwert 03:22:35 Thanks.
Cletus Cobbington 03:23:06 I also came.
Kaladen Shash 03:23:08 Yeah, Sylvan you mean, like Elvish? Got it.
Cyrus Schwert 03:23:08 I have Elvish not Sylvan. So yes.
Dungeon Master 03:23:12 No, Elvish, not Sylvan. Sylvan is like a more ancient, like, think of it as like the primitive Elvish. So you can speak Elvish. So you can read it. The second lock in Elvish says close. The third lock, anybody read Dwarvish in the party?
Kaladen Shash 03:23:37 I can, I can cast comprehend languages. It's just going to be a ritual cast. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:23:43 Do you want to spend the 10 minutes to do that? You guys see Kaladin, as you guys are trying to decipher the locks, throws a book open on the ground and starts like drawing runes on the door and shit as you guys are reading. Does anybody speak Dwarvish while he does that? Okay, so that one you can't read. Does anybody in the party speak Infernal?
Cletus Cobbington 03:23:47 No.
Leopold Magnus 03:24:06 No.
Dungeon Master 03:24:15 Okay, you can't read that one. The fifth lock, does anybody in the party speak giant? The fifth lock says open. The sixth lock, does anybody speak undercommon? Can't read that one. Seventh lock, does anybody speak halfling?
Cletus Cobbington 03:24:17 Yes, sir.
Zariel Torgan 03:24:25 Peace.
Cyrus Schwert 03:24:28 Yes.
Dungeon Master 03:24:42 OK, can't read that one either. So you can read a couple of them. You can read the first one in common, the second one in Elvish, and you can read the fifth one in Giant. But after 10 minutes, Kaladin can read the rest to you. The order goes open, close, open, close,
Dungeon Master 03:25:10 Open, close, close.
Cyrus Schwert 03:25:17 So on one, three and five it says open.
Cletus Cobbington 03:25:37 That's the full thing? That's all of them? Or that's just the ones, okay. Let's open one, three, and five, right?
Dungeon Master 03:25:40 That's it. They have either open or closed written next to them. That's the only thing you see.
Cyrus Schwert 03:25:55 Well, I would think that it would match to the numbers. I think we would need number three to put in the number three spot.
Kaladen Shash 03:26:04 Yeah. Does it look? Does it look like these are orbs or the actual physical keyholes? Uhm? I don't think I have a tool kit for that.
Cletus Cobbington 03:26:07 Oh, the keys.
Dungeon Master 03:26:10 These look like physical keyholes that you would like me to pick or do something else.
Kaladen Shash 03:26:32 I don't, I don't think I have proficiency at sleight of hand either. Tinkerer? Be a bolt. What can you, what can you do for us? We need something to open these locks.
Dungeon Master 03:26:41 Now the tinker and the party could make thieves tools for sure.
Leopold Magnus 03:26:46 Yes. I think I could maybe come up with something. Just give me a little bit of time and some workshop space. And I guess, Zario, if you could set the toolbox out, I'll disappear down into it for some time. I guess you guys haven't seen it yet.
Cletus Cobbington 03:26:50 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 03:27:08 Yeah, I'll crack it open.
Dungeon Master 03:27:11 You guys see that on Zariel's side, he has an out of the ordinary, doesn't like, sorry, it's weird, it's abnormal. He's got this red rusted sort of old toolbox that sits on his side wrapped up. He puts it on the ground, he takes off the wrapping, he opens it up, and descending into a space is a ladder. And you see he climbs down the ladder into this workshop that is opened up.
Cletus Cobbington 03:27:19 Silence.
Leopold Magnus 03:27:44 And I'll go down there and I'll start tinkering away, building up the link key to get those locks open. Yep.
Cletus Cobbington 03:27:51 Probably.
Dungeon Master 03:27:57 OK, I think a tinker you just you have something called the right tool for the job so you can just create the tool you need and doesn't take a whole lot of time. But who would like to attempt to pick? These locks. It would be a slight of hand shot.
Kaladen Shash 03:28:14 Would that be a slight of hand check? I'm pretty good at this. Not great, but pretty good. I don't know if anybody else is like plus five or so. Let me, I will, I will, I will,
Cletus Cobbington 03:28:26 My hands are too big for that stuff. I'll cast Guidance.
Cyrus Schwert 03:28:32 That's what I have. I'm at plus 5 as well.
Zariel Torgan 03:28:38 I can give guidance. Double guidance. Everybody cast guidance at once.
Dungeon Master 03:28:41 You can guide, you can aid. You guys want to give some assistance? You only get one guidance.
Kaladen Shash 03:28:43 Yeah, there we go. Yes, I will assist. Cyprus. Let me go. I guess it for. I guess it for both me. Oh no, no, cause I'll still give him a plus two. I'll assist. He'll have guidance in a plus two.
Leopold Magnus 03:28:58 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 03:28:59 turns into one big one.
Dungeon Master 03:29:06 Yeah, so whoever wants to do it, you have a D4 and then you have however many other people want to help out. It'll be plus 2 for each of those. So plus 2. Plus. 4 plus 6 overall. Plus 5. Yeah, so any.
Kaladen Shash 03:29:19 going to be such, you know, going to be a real backseat driver. I said G-Eagle, not Shake. I said G-Eagle.
Zariel Torgan 03:29:25 We're all just crowded around
Cyrus Schwert 03:29:28 So it's a side hand and then a d4. OK, so this will be plus the total then, because I have a plus 5 and you said plus 11.
Leopold Magnus 03:29:29 So we can all help, right? Cool. I'll come up with the tool, hand it to Kaladin.
Dungeon Master 03:29:35 Yeah, everybody can. Help out, it's it's a slight of hand check plus a D4 plus 11. Oh, plus 11 wasn't putting your plus 5. It's plus 6 plus 5.
Kaladen Shash 03:29:49 Thanks.
Cyrus Schwert 03:30:00 So this is plus 11. So 24. Should I just go again? I wouldn't have the guidance again, though, right?
Dungeon Master 03:30:06 24, the first lock you pick and in a second you hear that little click and the whole thing rotates and you see like a flash of gold around the lock. Exact same thing. Guidance takes an action to cast, they can guide you.
Zariel Torgan 03:30:18 Nice. Second guide. Yeah, you'll have guidance for all of them.
Kaladen Shash 03:30:23 Yeah, just like that. Do it again.
Cletus Cobbington 03:30:24 Keep going. I slap you on the back.
Cyrus Schwert 03:30:34 Got it. 27. And we'll go for the fifth slot. Another 27. Let's go.
Dungeon Master 03:30:41 27. Second lock turns, clicks with a flash of gold. That one has been unlocked. 27. Yeah, that was an insane combo. It was such a high roll. It went DC, 15, 20, 25, and you blew it out of the water. Click, door opens, reveal.
Kaladen Shash 03:31:04 That's sweet.
Cletus Cobbington 03:31:06 Sure. Peasants are kicking ass now. Maybe I should start a lock farm.
Cyrus Schwert 03:31:07 Who's the peasant now? Who's the peasant now? Out here looking at all kinds of stuff. You know me. This is a real adventure. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So does this usually happen?
Dungeon Master 03:31:12 Opens and he is revealing it. The fourth key. Yeah, you find the the orb with the number four on it in that room.
Leopold Magnus 03:31:17 Well, he's not very good at bailing hay, but he sure can pick a lock.
Cyrus Schwert 03:31:39 Got it. OK. All right.
Kaladen Shash 03:31:40 All right, sweet.
Dungeon Master 03:31:47 You guys pick that up. OK. From here, you guys have, unless you're re-splitting up however you're doing it, there is.
Dungeon Master 03:32:07 This path which leads to this door this way or this room this door down at the bottom. And those are your two directions you guys want to start at.
Cyrus Schwert 03:32:33 Are we still going?
Kaladen Shash 03:32:42 Was that track? Yeah. Yeah, just kind of keep floating that way. We'll go that way, that's the plan.
Dungeon Master 03:32:48 We could start it and go in a certain direction. I just want to know where you guys are going for next time. So you're going this way, big plan?
Cletus Cobbington 03:32:57 I mean, we're all together again, might as well continue together. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 03:33:03 Yeah, let's just keep pushing.
Leopold Magnus 03:33:10 Let's do it. Yeah, I can do that. Make it work.
Kaladen Shash 03:33:10 Are we are we aiming at Tuesday night or are we trying to skip a week or what's everybody's availability look like? Yeah. Great. OK.
Dungeon Master 03:33:17 I'm down for Tuesday. Planning was easy for me because it's just like you guys are saying, it's just Dungeon Crawl right now to change it up for you guys. So everything's been planned. So I could do Tuesday and have gone because everything's already done.
Cyrus Schwert 03:33:20 I'm good.
Zariel Torgan 03:33:35 Yeah, I think that could probably work. I think that moving forward I might want to see if we can push for like a Wednesday or a Sunday or a... I don't know. I know I wanted us to switch to Tuesdays, but... I did, I did. But if we could make it a different day than now, I could make another day work too. So...
Dungeon Master 03:33:47 Do you absolutely want us to switch to Tuesdays? OK. Then while we have everybody, I know Wednesdays don't work for Travis because he's got trivia. Yes.
Cyrus Schwert 03:34:11 Early, yes. That is required with me.
Zariel Torgan 03:34:13 Thursdays are good. Yeah, that'd be cool.
Kaladen Shash 03:34:13 Yeah. I think Thursday is fine. That works.
Dungeon Master 03:34:18 Is there a day we all can agree upon? Thursdays would also be fine for me. Trace? Okay. Do we want to do Thursday this week or Tuesday this week?
Leopold Magnus 03:34:22 Yeah, Thursdays would work.
Cletus Cobbington 03:34:30 should work. I think any day really. I never have any like set day for every week. Well, let's just do Thursday. Make it easy.
Zariel Torgan 03:34:44 I could make either of them work. I think Thursday would just be more convenient. Sweet. Yeah. Awesome, thank you. Thanks for being amenable. Well, you know, a little of this, a little of that.
Dungeon Master 03:34:51 Okay. Thursday, 730. Love it. Okay. Yeah. Jeez, what do you do? Like run businesses or something? Jeez.
Cyrus Schwert 03:34:52 Yes.
Leopold Magnus 03:34:53 Cool. Thursday it is.
Kaladen Shash 03:34:53 Yeah, it'll be Thursday, 1130. OK. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 03:35:01 That was good.
Dungeon Master 03:35:14 Um, yeah, that's totally fine. Uh, yeah, as you guys are traveling together, I think it strikes as odd. The, the odiers, you sort of have these two new members who one of them is killed multiple, multiple things this night with this like corroded old now metal sword that started off as a full length scimitar, but as maybe just like a, a long dagger at this point of just melted metal, um, dairy, uh, not dairy.
Cyrus Schwert 03:35:33 The dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one.
Cletus Cobbington 03:35:36 One.
Zariel Torgan 03:35:39 fit a butter knife that he's slicing people with.
Dungeon Master 03:35:44 Cletus doesn't look very hurt at all. He looks like he's holding his own real well. He's just chatting with his little squirrel as he sort of tails up behind the group as you guys walk along. If you guys have, I don't know. Travis will talk about it because I think this sword is very fitting for your character so we can make it like a little bit stronger.
Dungeon Master 03:36:13 But if you guys, I don't know, do you, the other thing they have is a spear that is finesse, so you could use it, and it does poison damage. It's like a D, it's like a plus two weapon does poison, a D6 poison.
Cyrus Schwert 03:36:13 Cool. Interesting. OK. I don't know.
Cletus Cobbington 03:36:19 Silence.
Dungeon Master 03:36:37 So just up to you. We could change the sword you just got to be plus two to sort of match it if you wanted to go the theme over the sword of like peace or whatever it was. Or if you wanted to have the spear instead, that's already created. What does that work for? Is that just slashing damage?
Cyrus Schwert 03:36:50 Yeah. I did take the slasher feat, so that would lead me towards... I think it's just damage. A couple things that I get boost for when using slashing things.
Dungeon Master 03:37:13 Okay, so more incentive for... It does do piercing damage. Yeah, okay. Well, what I'm saying is the Peacemaker Sword is very fitting for a bard who is very new to killing people, but like, you know, maybe doesn't want to kill people.
Kaladen Shash 03:37:13 I'm just sure. Yeah. This person damage.
Cletus Cobbington 03:37:18 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 03:37:20 I mean, I just made my character today, so if we choose the spear, it'll give me a little leniency. OK.
Zariel Torgan 03:37:44 Be the pieces maker. Yeah, awesome guys.
Dungeon Master 03:37:44 So I can buff it to be on par of being as good as the spear, but just custom for you. So we could do that. Beautiful. You're welcome. This is going to be funny.
Kaladen Shash 03:37:52 Yeah Yeah, I know this is gonna be this is gonna be great He's not he's an almond milker he's a milker
Cyrus Schwert 03:37:54 OK. Thanks for having me.
Cletus Cobbington 03:37:56 From farmhand to peacemaker. Yeah, they let us play. Accepting my Hick Almond Farmer. Almond. We're saying, I grow the almonds, but we milk the almonds.
Leopold Magnus 03:38:07 Of course, super fun.
Dungeon Master 03:38:15 Is it almond farmer or almond milk farmer?
Zariel Torgan 03:38:22 Everybody just wants the nuts, and he's like, no. Only milk. Can I just have the almonds?
Cletus Cobbington 03:38:25 So take that as you, almond milk producer, almond farmer, that's how that works. Trade secret. Trade secret, we keep it respectful and environmentally friendly.
Kaladen Shash 03:38:25 Yeah. Is it? Getting that nut. Milk milk milker, yes.
Leopold Magnus 03:38:36 Where are the nipples on an almond? Yeah. Age-free. Age-free almond.

Kaladen Shash 00:00:00 Yep. I love that.
Dungeon Master 00:00:02 Holy shit, Craig fucks. Okay. In our last session, you guys, I think finished your long rest in your pocket workshop.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:05 He just has a pair of pit vipers on. Where the ladies at?
Ratshit 00:00:10 Understood. That makes more sense.
Zariel Torgan 00:00:12 That's good. Uh.
Dungeon Master 00:00:24 had a discussion where you had decided to double back because you were at the perimeter of the Dome City. You doubled all the way back to the cave system, taking about a half day. You traveled up the sort of underground water stream via water walk, cast by Zariel, cast a few times, sort of found a little hack where you could virtual cast it before it expired and just kind of keep it going.
Dungeon Master 00:00:49 You made it back to the central cavern that had the hole in the roof that you had sort of dropped in through, and Zariel had wild shaped into a giant spider that he could sort of ferry the group up through it. In that upper level, you had a nat 20 on an investigation check, which sort of helped you pick up some magical aura, sort of faintly at the perimeter of the southern wall. You guys through sort of long investigation,
Dungeon Master 00:01:17 Sneaking through these tunnels, you found some arcane glyphs that had a little riddle on it that said, three for a wedding, which is very reminiscent of the same sort of glyph you had found a couple weeks ago that said, one for sorrow. Not sure what it means, you feel like maybe you missed whatever the two was.
Dungeon Master 00:01:36 But eventually you had sort of wandered into a bunch of magma and lava tubes. This is taken at this point the full day. So you had started in the morning, made it to the evening before you entered a large cavern in which you had heard some noise, but you couldn't see anything. And Leopold had shot a magic rock into a bubbling lava pool, hitting a young red dragon in the head that had been laying in it. This is where you had your sort of pretty epic fight.
Dungeon Master 00:02:03 where it looked pretty grim the whole time but with a combination of the dragon only getting its breath weapon once through the whole fight and then again at the very end and you guys having some pretty nasty nat 20s on it you finally destroyed it cut off its head uh looted it for everything and then made your way into this room that you guys find yourself in right now and then uh rex i don't know if you want to share your screen for travis so he can see it
Leopold Magnus 00:02:32 Oh yeah, let me log on. Got it. You guys see it?
Ratshit 00:02:36 XP week.
Dungeon Master 00:02:39 But in here, you've been feeling this constant thrum the whole time. And eventually, it came to a point where Zariel sort of lost control of his body and he walked. We can watch the stream. Pretty sick.
Zariel Torgan 00:03:02 Look at that. Left the porn tab up.
Leopold Magnus 00:03:07 Uh, yeah, sorry. Yeah. And I'm sorry, guys. I got to prime myself before the sessions, you know. That's fucking on.
Dungeon Master 00:03:12 Cool. He says he gets inspiration, you know. He's not lying about that.
Ratshit 00:03:12 Perfect. Thank you. The juice is flowing. Beautiful.
Dungeon Master 00:03:28 You lost control of your body and you touch the sort of glass casing around the arcane beam, the very same beam that travels through the center of the core, shoots out of the top of the giant pillar, hits the dome and sort of keeps it fresh, magical, non-deteriorating, sort of protects the city, but you guys are deep, deep in the depths of the earth at this level.
Dungeon Master 00:03:53 Zariel had a surge of energy sort of peruse through his arm, mapping out essentially what looked like a vein system of just purple arcana. And then around it, you can see the glint of the metal that's underneath his flesh, except when he pulled his hand away and you guys had tried to heal it, you noticed that you could not get the skin to sort of recover the area that had been scorched.
Dungeon Master 00:04:18 Showing the first manifestation of mutation from your guys' curse. The rest of you, through sort of some trial and error, ended up touching the glass casing as well, but you didn't see anything happen to you. You sort of hadn't pushed yourself to that point yet.
Dungeon Master 00:04:36 before Leopold sort of forcefully ripped out one of the arcane pores out of the unconscious body of that Blackguard knight, the one that had the same crest on its face that he has on its shoulder. He saw sort of the inner gear mechanisms and cores dim a little bit, just over a faint glow at this point. But then he took the core and pressed it up to the glass casing and noticed that it had fully charged it back up to full.
Dungeon Master 00:05:06 It didn't take on any of like the purple special magic appearance of it, but he was able to charge it all the way. And then he did also put his hand on it. At that point, you guys had sort of taken your long rest and in case and in just just in case you guys want to do something first, let me know. Otherwise, we're actually going to start a couple of days back in the med bay.
Dungeon Master 00:05:34 with Ratchet. So you guys get first dibs if you want to do something, otherwise we're jumping to Travis to get him warmed up. This is just like, we'll think of it like simultaneous. It's not a flashback. You guys had just left. Yeah, Ratchet, the last you had seen, had been laid up on a medical bay, intubated, arm in a sling. You saw him
Leopold Magnus 00:05:40 This is a flashback. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:49 Yeah, like Tarantino-esque.
Dungeon Master 00:06:02 just like before everything he had like his he looked in pretty rough shape so he's been getting like constant medical treatment to sort of bring him back up but then you guys had left on your next little mission at that point to go after cedric so you haven't seen him in a while so this is where we picked up for him unless you guys wanted to do something before that
Leopold Magnus 00:06:27 No.
Zariel Torgan 00:06:27 Can I get a quick reminder of what I got from touching that thing?
Dungeon Master 00:06:33 Yes. Yes, you can. I believe it is. You can heal. Something down. Hold on. Wait a minute. Out of your time.
Zariel Torgan 00:06:54 Yeah, I remember it was like, I can heal by taking other people's damage and taking it myself. Right? Well, you don't have to do it now. I don't need to take up time to figure that out now. Just if there's a lull or something, if you could give it to me.
Dungeon Master 00:07:03 yeah i don't know where i wrote it i can find it for sure no i'm pretty sure it's you can touch a creature once per day and heal it for 2d8 hit points but you take
Dungeon Master 00:07:29 2d8 damage in the process like you take from your hit points and put into something else yeah yeah no it's it's both ways so you roll on the new roll
Zariel Torgan 00:07:37 Would it be I roll 2d8 for them and then I also roll 2d8 for me, that way it could be better or worse? Or is it just I roll 2d8, auto from me, auto to them? Okay, all right, sweet. Well, that's all I got.
Dungeon Master 00:07:57 Okay, but we'll start a couple days back. I'm not going to change the map because I don't want it to remove you guys from this image and then have a hard time loading for when we come back to it but ratchet.
Dungeon Master 00:08:10 You spend each of your nights in the medbay. It's sort of this white lab looking spot. It had been recently attacked during sort of the cult's siege on the city. And some important things had been stolen from a room in here. So the whole thing was sort of ransacked. So it looks more like a military camp kind of medbay where it's just very makeshift. Cots are set up all over the place as people are laid up.
Dungeon Master 00:08:36 You are no longer intubated at this point, but your arm is still in a sling. And this is just one day after the group that you oversee called the O'Dears set out to sort of finish their mission to take out the person who actually did this to the med bay. But at this point, you're not expected to report into the Corps at any point soon. You sort of have the morning to yourself.
Dungeon Master 00:09:06 If there's anything you think that he would do in this moment, you can sort of go after it. Otherwise, you would normally go into work. Yeah, so you get up.
Ratshit 00:09:17 I don't know if there's anything I don't think I'm just very wounded
Dungeon Master 00:09:34 your throat's a little sore after being struck down. You have vivid nightmares of leading this group into this underground chapel. And then as they engage in this fight, this angelic being rises into the sky and smites you down unconscious. And you feel like you were unconscious for like a long time. Like there at any point you could have been brought back up, but like you were, you were sort of down for a while.
Dungeon Master 00:10:05 But you make your way through the core. It's this enormous cylindrical building that borders every single section of the city. So the Stonewall Legionnaire has access to all ports pretty easily, but you sort of live in the central hub. And the Med Bay is a couple levels down. The general barracks are in the center, and you're like next.
Dungeon Master 00:10:29 Point is normally your office that you share with a captain leave and who's one of like the city regents of the storm district.
Ratshit 00:10:41 I mean, yeah, I go to work, I suppose. Into the office. I don't know anything else. I just work all the time. I'm a workaholic. Just tracking down these dipshits.
Dungeon Master 00:11:00 You are walking to the central hub at this point and you're strapping on your armor one shoulder at a time, clasping it. It's got the signature arcane runes on the left breastplate of your armor.
Dungeon Master 00:11:20 that like the whole Legionnaire can use for intercommunication. And you have sort of a constant frequency playing out a message because not only have the O'Dears not been seen in the full day, at one point during the night, their sort of vital lifeline that reports back to the city that lets them know if they're in trouble went like offline, which doesn't ever happen.
Dungeon Master 00:11:47 Not like they died and it flatlined but just like disappeared off the map. So it's a little stressed because this new group that you've been watching for the last couple weeks is kind of a real pain in your ass at this point. But you enter the sort of central room. It's earlier morning and you just change the channel and it's just static again. Roll your eyes, go back in and as you're walking in everybody
Ratshit 00:11:59 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 00:12:16 It's sort of the newer recruits and some of the guys had been there a while but were like under you. You see all of them are sort of just like taking glances at you as you walk by. Not that quite pity look, but they look at you and they're like, ooh, he looks like he had a rough time. A lot of these being the same people who nicknamed you Ratchet after your first mission had ended pretty poorly in that basement.
Ratshit 00:12:34 It's bad enough to be named fucking ratchet, but now I think everybody's looking at me weird First day of my life
Dungeon Master 00:12:44 You take it in stride, but the looks are a little off today. And then you make it to your author.
Dungeon Master 00:12:59 And you see sort of arms out on the table sort of leaning forward, weight-bearing, and then looking over some papers. He's got some arcane runes displayed on like a glass sheet to his left. And you see he's sort of scrolling through in the New New Arbor, the Southern Dome.
Dungeon Master 00:13:18 The technology's like bordering steampunk-esque, like it's just out of high fantasy. Most people still have martial weapons, but they're seeing like advancements with energy being made instead of plastic metal. So it's in this weird in-between times of technology. So you see Captain Levi in his very classic Southern sort of, he's got these arcane firing bolts, like cross bolts that are customized for him.
Dungeon Master 00:13:46 um as he's leaning over and you see he like looks up at you and gives you a nod as you enter the room and he just goes well you man you look fucking shitty right now but i'll tell you what it's a little bit better than yesterday and that's a win he looks down at his things and he goes uh what do you think happened with those dipshits that like oh 800 left they just fucking disappeared off the map
Ratshit 00:14:12 Yeah, who knows, man? I know they're chasing somebody. Sorry. My voice isn't here. The intubation fucked my soft tissues. Thanks, man.
Dungeon Master 00:14:26 He stifles a laugh. He's like, I hadn't even noticed. You sound great. If it's just me, I mean, you look great too. He gives it a little wide look and he goes, yeah, totally. Lord Marshall's expecting us in like an hour or so. I mean, we can do something until then. I got a debrief, a couple of my soldiers, but
Dungeon Master 00:14:53 I think he's going to ask you something about these groups. You're a pretty good tracker back in the day. I know that's not really your specialty now, but if you were tasked up to it, would you go looking for those trickle fucks? That's what I told him while you were laid up. Just wanted to get it clear. But yeah, there's some talk that there's
Ratshit 00:15:07 I could pull out the old Sniffers and I could figure it out.
Dungeon Master 00:15:22 Not quite a rat in the core, pardon my joke, but Lord Marshall's not trusting a whole lot of people right now, and these people have already shown a lack of character a couple times when they hit that woman, and then they went a little AWOL going after Thedrick a little early, but you think they did it?
Ratshit 00:15:46 You know, they might be a dysfunctional group, but they, uh, they persevere. Most of the time, except when it comes to helping me, you know. It is what it is. You cannot joke about that. Don't joke about my- I tried really hard. I've put off having a family.
Dungeon Master 00:15:57 Well, you can make the joke that they're getting that promotion that you didn't get because they didn't help you. I mean, maybe you get it, too. Don't get me wrong. I'm just saying it was it.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:07 Thank you.
Ratshit 00:16:22 I'm almost dead and I showed up to work. What does that say about me? Well, that sucks.
Dungeon Master 00:16:27 I mean you should check in with Sylvaris. He's looking rough too. His whole crew died. You know that Sylvaris Sunseeker is like this high elf type noble that uh he was an omen knight that went and assisted the party in fighting the reverend but on his way down he lost uh every member of his crew and he almost died as well and he retired after meeting them.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:43 Thank you.
Ratshit 00:16:54 Hmm I mean, I want to retire too, but i'm only 26 so I got a ways to go
Dungeon Master 00:17:06 You guys bullshit for a little bit, you start like filing a paper like you have a pretty shitty job being a CEO, and that like you don't get out on a lot of missions anymore.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:15 That sounds great. We're not going back.
Dungeon Master 00:17:19 Like the little excursion with the O'Dears was the first one you had been on in a while, you even said as much. But you guys file your reports, you balance everything, you make sure that the soldiers you oversee getting paid, have their assignments. You were filing a couple assignments with the intention of if the O'Dears make it back and they've completed their goal, they're going to be offered the first excursion out of the dome that's supposed to be successful.
Dungeon Master 00:17:47 because of the last one ended pretty horribly. These guys seem a little capable, but like you have to, they have to run their trust first. So it's been a couple hours and eventually you're summoned to this big regal office. And again, we can, we could switch to it later when it comes back up. But I think if I switch off of this page, it won't load again. Like out of game, like I got a Reddit notification that said my post had been removed because it didn't fit D and D for some reason.
Ratshit 00:18:08 you
Dungeon Master 00:18:16 Not sure why. I feel like it's very D&D. But I feel like everything's gonna be... So anyway, you make your way to this big office and Lord Marshal Thurr is a large man. He used to be a pretty elite fighter before he like retired and went political. You are not directly underneath him but you work under and with Captain Levi who works directly for him.
Kaladen Shash 00:18:16 What?
Dungeon Master 00:18:43 A big man, well over six and a half feet. He's got a large beard mixed with red and he's got a white stripe in the middle from where his age is showing. He's got a deep, rough voice and he looks and he goes, sit, please. And he gestures for you to sit down in front of him. And as you sit, go ahead and give me a perception check.
Ratshit 00:19:01 Hold on.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:11 Yes, thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:19:20 19. Nice. He looks tired.
Dungeon Master 00:19:26 This is a pretty hardy man but you see that you know he's been really busy lately being part of the high council. He's one of like the lords of the city in his position. He's usually pretty busy but ever since the city got attacked he's been pretty absent just back and forth not really telling anybody what he's up to. He's probably sworn to secrecy with something but you see him sit down today and he just lets out a pretty exasperated sigh in the process.
Dungeon Master 00:19:55 And he goes, I assume you all saw the report of the O'Dears. Captain Levi shoots you a look, looks at him, and he goes, yeah, it's a little frustrating, I'm not gonna lie. I don't know what you see in them. I mean, they're real cool, but fuck, man. They're like, it's not directly insubordinate.
Ratshit 00:20:04 Yes.
Dungeon Master 00:20:23 Shit, man. You guys are on the world at this point. And he sort of shoots a chuckle and leans on the desk. And Lord Marshall continues and he goes, it's a little more than that. Last we had tracked them, they were below the city. And then somehow they managed to get out of the range of our system.
Dungeon Master 00:20:50 Whether that means they went so deep that they are just beyond our scope, or they found a way out of the city from the cave system. That's sort of one of our biggest fears. It's just a direct access for any sort of potential threat. And he sort of, like, gives an eyebrow like, you know, this is pretty bad at that point. And he goes,
Dungeon Master 00:21:16 You're pretty bright, so I imagine you know that what I'm going to ask you next is, I need you to find them, right? Usually he gets a concerned look on his face and he goes, are you all right? Your voice is a little different.
Ratshit 00:21:26 Yeah, that makes sense, I guess. I could pull out the old sniffers, as I said earlier. Yeah, my soft tissues have been damaged by the medical problems I've been having. These fucking kids.
Dungeon Master 00:21:53 Yeah, I wish you a well recovery. Consider. I get it. Because I mean, I know you've been really vying for the position as well, but you find these guys and you bring them back. And if they have been successful in tracking down that cultists.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:56 Cool.
Ratshit 00:22:00 Nice soft tissues.
Dungeon Master 00:22:19 Consider the invitation to Omen Night extended to you as well. I know you've been looking for it. It's honestly about time. Yeah, of course. He sighs. Not out of what you said, but it's just about time because he was going to be tired, but then he catches himself and looks at you, shakes his head. You guys have been working together a long time, so it's more of like just giving you a hard time.
Ratshit 00:22:31 Thank you, sir. Sir. I mean, sir. Sorry.
Dungeon Master 00:22:49 rubs his temple, and he's like, they're not fucking dead. Otherwise, who are we going to find to leave the city when it's actually time? Last known, they had said something about heading to the chapel. They thought that there was an entrance that way when they had seen, not seen Sedgwick, but they said something about being able to smell flowers. Doesn't make sense to me, but that doesn't matter.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:57 I'm going to go in the chair.
Dungeon Master 00:23:19 I want you to start there, and if and when you do find them, and you can't join with them, and you can't bring them back, let them know that not only am I looking for them, but they've been requested by the High Council for a meeting. And unless you have any questions, I think that is all. You guys are dismissed after that.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:37 God work. We can
Ratshit 00:23:45 Yes, sir.
Dungeon Master 00:23:49 Perfect. Levi goes, I'll join up with you, Ratchet, in just a moment. I got to talk with Lord Marshall about something. And he sort of ushers you out as they start going into conversation about some things. Sounds boring at first. You don't stay long enough to do it, but you make your way through the city.
Dungeon Master 00:24:07 by probably early afternoon at this point, you know you're heading to the same place that you had been downed before, which is this underground chapel devoted to a forgotten god of long ago. Pretty epic battle to sort of just kind of like look at the remnants of, but as you're sort of making your way through this huge mega city at this point, we'll jump back forward in time to the group of three, as you guys have, are partway through your sleep, and this is a couple days
Dungeon Master 00:24:36 in advance between, I'm going to say, let's do between Zariel and Kaladin. Go ahead and do Rollies. Lowest number goes first.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:41 Yeah, I got the music on.
Dungeon Master 00:25:05 You guys on the music as well? Jesse, did you ruin that for me?
Leopold Magnus 00:25:08 Yeah. Ratshit wasn't the same after the accident.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:14 Also, is anybody else getting like... I did, yeah. Is anybody else getting like Milton from Office Space vibes from Travis's character?
Ratshit 00:25:29 It's on my stapler. I don't mind a voice, but I don't know if I can maintain that. I just don't.
Dungeon Master 00:25:35 I told Travis, no, I told Travis, I was like, you could play this character. And I was like, he does have an Irish accent, by the way. And he's like, not doing that. It took me a long time to maintain it. Kaladin, you're first.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:46 I'm gonna do what I'm gonna say
Dungeon Master 00:26:04 It seems to be mid-sleep at this point. You don't know where you are at. It's sort of that hazy place between deep conscious and sort of REM sleep. You hear a noise and you rise first to your elbows from the laying position, sort of then onto your hands, lifting up.
Dungeon Master 00:26:26 You see that same sort of sheer black fabric at the periphery of your vision, sort of framing this dark space. But in this dark space this time, you see the central pillar, the energy beam surrounded by the arcane technology, giving off this purple light that sort of bathes you from front. From this position, you look and you see
Dungeon Master 00:26:51 the tall, lanky, almost spidery form of that creature that you've been seeing in your periphery, in alleyways, in the depths of your dreams. It speaks to you from beyond the sheet, but it seems oddly human in this stance that it's taking.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:00 And then you can get the results as you approach.
Dungeon Master 00:27:09 It's got its legs a little bit far apart, sort of like wide stance, arms wrapped, draped behind its back, sort of palms grabbing the other one, just kind of nicely placed. It has a tall form of seven, eight, eight and a half feet tall, maybe taller.
Dungeon Master 00:27:32 arms far too long for its body sort of hanging well below its butt, its head smooth and hairless with long ears that kind of point up instead of back, it has a flattened but wide nose that flares and dark black almond-shaped somniferous eyes sort of peer at you as it turns its head and in that sort of creepy voice you hear it say,
Dungeon Master 00:28:02 very human this time and very present. I was going to thank you, you know. I'd even prepared what to say and it sort of traces a finger on the glass. How the blood of my blood was the key in all along to bringing me back to this world. But it wasn't you, not entirely. He smirks and you see a grin that extends far beyond the frame of his normal mouth line, almost like a jack-o'-lantern.
Dungeon Master 00:28:32 Clever robot, though, finally pulled through. I have one message before I leave you. I have other people to talk to. I will find you. And I beg for you not to run. I have some things I've been trying to speak to you about, but I don't have the time. There are forces that are determined to keep me silenced about the truth of these blasted domes. I do believe you to be the keycap. You see, he peers again from over his shoulders.
Dungeon Master 00:29:01 And you look at him and you see beyond him that the energy of the beam that sort of shoots straight up, it always sort of tries to connect the closest thing to it. So he's standing very close to it, way ahead of you in the room. And you see like little strands of electricity sort of shooting out to him. But you see there are strands even at this far away that sort of jump out towards you.
Dungeon Master 00:29:28 like you've established some sort of connection, you see other ones sort of jump to the other members of the group, all fully unconscious. He notices and he's watching it with like a sick enjoyment, playfully tracing his elongated finger on the glass. He just looks, he goes, in time, please don't run. I'll always find you at night.
Dungeon Master 00:29:54 giggles a little bit to himself before stepping into the shadow and disappearing completely and you might stay awake for a while in this dark space but eventually that eerie feeling sort of fades that pressure of like what the fuck just happened goes away and you can find your way back to sleep if you'd like if you'd also like to say something you can as well
Kaladen Shash 00:30:22 Yeah, that was a lot to digest. Sounds like there's going to be some cross story between Leopold's master and this guy. No, I wouldn't have any questions as Leopold doesn't really remember anything yet either. So I think I'll just maybe tell everyone I had a dream and saw the beam in it or whatever.
Dungeon Master 00:30:36 Maybe. Try. When you wake, we'll go over that, but at this moment, though, when you wake up, we'll get to it, but simultaneously, unknown, unbeknownst to you,
Kaladen Shash 00:30:54 Oh, were you implying that... I thought you completely left my dream. Are you implying that I woke up, correct? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:31:06 Zariel, you are in a deep sleep. And occasionally, when you sleep like this, you have memories that surface that you couldn't remember from before your accident. You had one really previously that sort of rocked you a bit. And this one, in this night after this experience you've had, sort of picks up around the same time, before, after, it's unclear.
Dungeon Master 00:31:36 you watch from that same position in this room, this very futuristic sleek, like, like UFO shaped room, you know, like saucer shaped futuristic room, overlooking this huge city built on this cliff scape, connected by sky bridges of glass and everything. You're in this room that's well lit and you see
Dungeon Master 00:32:02 A handsome elven man standing away from you. Even for an elf, he shows a little bit of age, but he hasn't lost his looks by any means. He hasn't said anything this time, but he stands at the glass, looking away, hands clasped behind his back.
Dungeon Master 00:32:21 And he turns, gives you a nod and he walks swiftly and you have to follow behind him. You see he goes down these very nice sleek glass staircases that give a very short thud as he steps on them, just very sharp sound. You guys exit the building onto this round floating platform and he speaks very shortly with this mage that's sort of
Dungeon Master 00:32:44 manning it, and he goes, to the core, Damien, before placing his hands once again behind his back and facing to you, facing his building. This mage fires up this teleportation circle, and in a flash, you both teleport deep below the ground into this white tunnel that leads who knows where at this point, but you follow. Again, quiet, always in step with him, you just follow behind. You eventually hit a room that's bathed in this green light.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:05 Wait.
Dungeon Master 00:33:14 You see a very similar arcane beam and a very similarly futuristic room. But you see you spend hours in this room with this man as he conducts different experiments on it. He's connecting all these things, casting spells, taking notes. And after a few hours have passed, you see he throws his notes down in frustration. And you're just sort of an autopilot. You always follow him here. You always stand by the doorway waiting for a command.
Dungeon Master 00:33:44 And as you're waiting here in the screen, you realize you've done this a few times, more than a few times. You've done this dozens of times. He pushes his hair back on his head and he gestures for you to follow him out of the room. And as you guys are walking, you just hear him mutter. He goes, Z, I feel like I've run through the options of my scope. No matter my power, no matter the school of magic, I can't control it.
Dungeon Master 00:34:13 can't harness it like this this power that my family once did there must be an answer in this godforsaken sphere and i will be damned if i'm beaten to it you see he's got this competition always in his eyes as he pushes to be truly the best mage possible
Dungeon Master 00:34:30 You know that, you don't know how you know this, but you know that working for this mage, he is one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful mages on the continent currently at this time. And then you realize you're like, wait, what time? Before you wake up. And it is the morning. Everybody at this point would have leveled up. You guys all complete a long rest. Again, to reiterate,
Dungeon Master 00:34:57 Leopold, that arcane core, is still fully charged, it hasn't lost any power. No other damage to it, nothing else is new. Zariel's hand isn't healed still. It didn't sort of like form over again, so it seems like the effects of what happened are somewhat permanent. And then as you guys are in this room, everybody go ahead and give me a perception check.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:28 A 1 and a 20.
Kaladen Shash 00:35:30 Got it, I got it.
Dungeon Master 00:35:34 Natural 1 and natural 20. Calvin, I think maybe you being the most on edge probably awoke first, so you're a little bit more to your senses. Through, you guys have been down here, it was, you know, a day out, you guys trekked the land another day, took a full day to come back, and then you slept, so you're sort of in day 3, 4 of not having reported in.
Dungeon Master 00:35:59 And from the other side of this, Donnie Ratchet Farsight famed Hunter when he was an active soldier. You've spent the last day or so traveling these cavern systems, trying to figure out the right way. Eventually you pick up some weird signals.
Dungeon Master 00:36:21 And you are at like day two and a half of looking before you briefly see sort of a connection of the arcana of their like armor suits that were issued to them. Sort of letting you know that at some point they came back into like receiving distance of the core's magical abilities.
Dungeon Master 00:36:43 You sort of feel like they've come online. You get a confirmation from Captain Levi that goes, oh shit, looks like we've got intermittent vitals from that group. Seems like you're on the right path before he started disconnects. And you, after making your way through this incredibly perilous lava tunnel, you walk into this huge open room.
Dungeon Master 00:37:05 where on one side of the northern half of the cave, you see this large draconic serpent body laying on the ground with its head sliced off. These pools of lava light the space around. And at the very far corner of this room, you see a purple glow sort of down at the bottom left of the map. And you're making your way through, and you hear a little bit of chatter.
Dungeon Master 00:37:34 from a very familiar party. As you guys, going back into perspective, you see sort of crouching through this small entrance of this hidden room that you had found, Ratchet walks in.
Ratshit 00:37:52 What the hell are you guys doing? I'm just walking up right now. You're watching me walk in. I'm fucking trying to find you guys. I got my sniffers to the ground. I feel horrible! Everything is so bad!
Kaladen Shash 00:37:53 What? When did you get here? You guys ratchet, ratchet here.
Zariel Torgan 00:37:55 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:38:13 Renshit, are you feeling alright? Well, oh dear, you did get beat up quite a bit.
Dungeon Master 00:38:17 Okay.
Ratshit 00:38:22 I almost died, I had to get intubated in the hospital, they tore up my soft tissues, I've been telling everybody that, and now my voice is temporarily fucked, to be honest, and it just kinda matches my personality more, I think, honestly.
Leopold Magnus 00:38:40 I'm going to give him a little pat on the back and reassurance, but I think it's probably going to be a little too hard, so it might hurt just a bit. But I'm going to give you a pat on the back. There you go, Donnie. I'm glad you're backing Adam. How are you doing?
Zariel Torgan 00:38:40 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:38:55 I think this is a good time describing your characters for Travis who hasn't seen them before. As Leopold sort of lumbers over to give Ratchet a pat on the back, what does Ratchet see as you sort of walk over?
Ratshit 00:39:04 you
Leopold Magnus 00:39:12 Yeah, so you'll see a massive suit of imposing armor. It's kind of mechanical and whirling in between the plate. So you'll see some gears and puffs of steam emanating between the cracks.
Leopold Magnus 00:39:31 Leopold also has a interesting little antenna that protrudes off of his shoulder blades. It almost, you know, like a radio control antenna that you would see on a wind-up soldier. On the back of his armor is written Bone Crusher.
Leopold Magnus 00:39:52 with an iron gauntlet crushing a skull into powder. And his faceplate has some violet-purple light coming from underneath the helm. I guess the last thing to mention is the large horns on my helmet.
Ratshit 00:40:12 Huh?
Dungeon Master 00:40:18 When you first saw him, he was, it was like, what the fuck is this? Cause even though, I mean, the city is massive and it's like a couple of New York's placed next to each other. Like it takes days sometimes to get from one end to the other, which is why being a legionnaire is so cool. Cause you have like the service tunnels that take you really quickly through the city. Um,
Dungeon Master 00:40:38 when they had tried out seeing leopold for the first time he really turned heads because there's there's like automaton technology in new new arbor to see but to see a sentient suit of armor like not common nobody sees this shit it's weird and then you've sort of he's been working for you for a little bit now so you see he walks up and he gives you a huge pat on the back and almost knocks the wind out of you hurting your throat a little bit more uh you see behind him
Zariel Torgan 00:41:04 Yeah, we're kind of an amalgamized race system. So more humanoid than anything.
Ratshit 00:41:06 That cracks.
Dungeon Master 00:41:08 You see, we'll do Zariel next. Zariel, what does he see, even with your, we'll say, new form of your arm, what does he see as the character as well?
Zariel Torgan 00:41:34 just like a really dirty, dirty brown, like mid-level hair right about above the eyes. And the armor that we'd gotten from the Legionnaires with a bit of its own flair, a little more of natural winding vines and leaves on this kind of
Zariel Torgan 00:41:58 sharp face. You can see that he has, I'm imagining it, and Jonathan, you can correct me, as like the T-1000 when he gets his arm ripped off, except instead of it being really futuristic, it's more like, trying to think of a way to describe it, a little more artsy. There's like more art to,
Dungeon Master 00:42:04 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:25 the machinery than would necessarily need to be there for it to be practical. So it's just like nice winding gears and like common through lines that move throughout the length of the hand that give it a sense of symmetry. But he kind of, he's not showing it off. You know, it's like his arms are crossed, there's like little bits of it poking out. He's pretty quiet, but you know, he's got a friendly face.
Dungeon Master 00:42:56 Yeah. Um, the arm is new since you've seen him last ratchet. He was sort of, he works for the core longer than any of the other people here, but he was like a maintenance tunnel worker, real grid of the earth. Never really saw him unless he had to come up for something. And then one day he tried out for the Legionnaires with Leopold. Apparently they knew each other, um, looked completely normal in Duvin is the closest thing to humans. When we say human, just think of like generic.
Dungeon Master 00:43:25 Humanoid race, but like looking at him now, you see like massive damage has been sustained to his dominant arm, which I believe you said was his right arm, but. He you had seen little glimpses of it before after the fight with the Reverend, but it's definitely seems like there's a lot of metal underneath his skin.
Dungeon Master 00:43:47 And like he says, it's very artsy, symmetrical. Individual muscle fibers are their own metallic cords. It's not a suit of armor that's animated like Leopold. It's like a human body made of metal, essentially, is the difference.
Dungeon Master 00:44:04 And you see him sort of just getting out of bed. And the final person you see in the room would be Kaladin. Kaladin, what does he see? What would he have seen previously versus what is Kaladin's sort of new or fey form looks like?
Kaladen Shash 00:44:18 Yeah. So previously I, so just like, um, Zariel had said that they've kind of homogenized sort of races through just a thousand years of living in the dome. I still looked more elf than anything, having relatively pointy ears and some of the features, white hair, um, through our trial sort of
Kaladen Shash 00:44:49 fight and then again with Cedric. It kind of was apparent that I was a wizard and was taking fighting classes as well. I appear kind of like with blue eyes, fair skinned, half plate armor, blue leather underneath. Now I carry a really fun sword called Light Splitter. And then now what you would recognize is
Dungeon Master 00:45:16 And that's sort of the scene you walk into. Oh, go ahead.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:17 I'm a little taller than I already was, and I look more sort of spry or lean. My ears have elongated, and so has my face a little bit. I look like very, very elf, which is unusual. What's up?
Ratshit 00:45:41 What the, what the hell happened to you guys? This guy's big, this guy's a bit of metal. That's weird.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:48 Thanks.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:51 Nothing, Gretchen, nothing happened. We've been running through these tunnels for three days. Been terrible. You want me to do it with disadvantage, as I said?
Dungeon Master 00:46:02 Give me an insight check. Give me an exception check. With disadvantage, Kaladin. Yeah, you physically look a lot like a high fey elf and Ratchet working for the Legionnaire
Leopold Magnus 00:46:05 Well, yes, this has been quite an awful adventure, to be honest. Look at that mangy beast in the corner. We had to fight him to get out of these tunnels.
Kaladen Shash 00:46:25 Oh, well, not in that 20.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:25 It's
Dungeon Master 00:46:27 And this i mean this is important and it's not for no reason ratchet you didn't know this about him but he's met members of the high council like social events before he's been a part of the legionnaire for a few years now. And there are some like what would be considered pure blood elf ages on the council because people that station get elected to office pretty easily. And so you instantly look at him.
Ratshit 00:46:41 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:46:55 And you commented about how everybody looks different and he just blatantly lies and you're like, no bullshit, you look like a fucking elf. In your head you're just like, that's so false so quickly. Don't buy it for yourself.
Kaladen Shash 00:47:10 Don't worry. I just smile. Well, nothing happened. We took care of Cedric and his lackeys. We also had to fight Red Dragon. Look at it. Look. Huge. No head.
Zariel Torgan 00:47:16 Bye.
Ratshit 00:47:17 I mean, you're just walking around tunnels for three days and nothing happened. I find that hard to believe, to be honest. Yeah, that is pretty impressive. Sorry I wasn't here to help. I would have been a great help.
Kaladen Shash 00:47:48 Yes, where were you? Yes. Yes. Yes, yes, your soft tissues. We know. We know about your soft tissues.
Ratshit 00:47:48 I swear. Oh, me? I was very hurt. I was very hurt. And I still am, to be quite frank. My hard tissues have gotten better, but my soft tissues have not. My brain is a soft tissue, technically.
Dungeon Master 00:47:52 I don't know.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:01 Ellen, he's clearly not well. Listen to him.
Kaladen Shash 00:48:17 Oh. Get better.
Zariel Torgan 00:48:17 It's interesting how most people only take one night to fully heal from all things, and you seem to still be carrying on. I mean, the empirical evidence would suggest...
Ratshit 00:48:30 It only takes one knight to heal all wounds? That seems crazy. Like, that's not- that's not normal. I mean, this guy's a suit of armor. Things are weird here, that's how I get it.
Dungeon Master 00:48:41 The voice of logic we needed. The other thing you see. Yeah, the other thing you see.
Zariel Torgan 00:48:49 Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:54 What's wrong with being a suit of armor? Leopold's just staring at his hands blankly, not moving. Oh, it's quite all right.
Ratshit 00:48:57 I didn't say anything was wrong with it, I just, I just mean that, you know, it's 2024, people can identify as whatever they feel like. I didn't mean to upset you. If you say so.
Dungeon Master 00:49:14 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:19 Hmph.
Leopold Magnus 00:49:24 Can I make an Arcana check on Zariel's arm? Or maybe a check to investigate that closer? Because I think this is the first time we've had a chance to look at it too, right?
Dungeon Master 00:49:39 Unless he's like very obviously hiding it and making it difficult to see, you can, but that'd be up to Jesse.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:48 Yeah, I mean, as out of game, we know we can trust Ratchet because it's Travis. But as a character, I don't think I would want to show him that yet until we went back and reported and see how things shake down. So I'd probably be like having it just like tucked under like a sash or something.
Leopold Magnus 00:50:08 Okay, got it.
Kaladen Shash 00:50:14 Ratchet, have you come to take us back?
Ratshit 00:50:18 Yes, indeed I have. The guy named Thurr, I'm sure you know him. He's like everybody's boss. He said the High Council was asking for you guys. You guys have been kind of just running rampant in tunnels, killing dragons, you know, being off the grid and such, getting taller, you know, and they might have some questions for you.
Zariel Torgan 00:50:43 Is this a good meeting or a bad meeting?
Kaladen Shash 00:50:46 It's just my curse. It happens.
Ratshit 00:50:47 So I put my sniffers to the ground. I had to come find you and just deliver the message and probably bring you back. What do you say? I mean, to be honest, it seems like they like you more or less. You guys just, you know, get it together a little bit.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:19 Do I believe that?
Ratshit 00:51:20 I think you're good, you know? You're good at what you do, just the way you do it. Sometimes I don't agree with, but I think if you tell them you killed a dragon, I mean, that's pretty cool.
Dungeon Master 00:51:23 Yeah. Oh, you did get some, but I think we said like a small bags worth, like something you could hold in your hand.
Kaladen Shash 00:51:37 Hey Jonathan, couple quick questions. Did we get? Did we get a certain number of scales off with dragon? Take it that remember that, right? You said like five or six of them or something. That's not great.
Dungeon Master 00:52:00 uh yeah because you got only one fang you had a pretty low survival check on that one somebody else yeah of of the dragon you got
Kaladen Shash 00:52:06 I didn't cut off the thing, that was Leopold sawing at it for like an hour. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:11 Yeah, I tried. I couldn't.
Dungeon Master 00:52:14 like a fang and a half you broke one of them and then you got I think I said a small handful of dragon scales but they're pretty big so five or six kind of makes sense but if you wanted more than that I just in my head I don't want it to be more than like a small coin versus worth like you can't do an infinite number of things with dragon scales.
Kaladen Shash 00:52:34 I want to use it for armor just for that purpose. So if you think five or six of service. Cool, cool, cool. I'm just getting an upper hand mark. And then. Where was the the feature? Or like the flower for our? Communication. Is that part of? Is that part of Breath of the Wild?
Dungeon Master 00:52:37 You you could get enough. You can get enough to make like a front plate or a shoulder plate. Something that could change the effect of an article, sure. It is in the item. That's part. It's part of your breath of the Feywild math, yeah?
Kaladen Shash 00:53:07 What's that? Um? Then what is that feature called?
Dungeon Master 00:53:07 Breath of the Feywild DM. Hold on, I gotta look at the item. It's just essentially telepathy, but I think I called it like...
Dungeon Master 00:53:33 Blessing of the I am the ample die courts or something like that And now I think I just
Kaladen Shash 00:53:42 What's the other green court sister resistance to poison? Advantage on saving throws. Did you make the active ones and passive ones different? The change. That's OK, I was just asking.
Dungeon Master 00:54:07 Oh, interesting. Yeah, I don't know why it's not there. Uh, it should be. I wonder if the item like reverted or something like when it, cause it's D&D Beyond's been having some weird issues, but yeah, I have the description of it.
Kaladen Shash 00:54:19 That's OK, I would. I would just wanted to do that so that. We could we could. Yeah, we could try to have a conversation really quick in front of him in front of. Oh. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:54:33 Yeah, because it only left that a certain amount of hours equals your proficiency modifier before it faded. So you'd have to touch each of your party members again to sort of get it to activate on them.
Kaladen Shash 00:54:46 That's fine. I'm going to do that casually. I'm just going to walk because they're close to us. We're all kind of close by. We're like standing together. That's fine. Can I, can I touch both of them so that we could try to decide if we want to, how we want to approach everything or how we want to see how much Russia knows.
Dungeon Master 00:55:03 Yeah. Yes, you can. I'll leave it up to Travis if he wants to make a check on it. Like, does he think Ratchet has the wherewithal to see something as subtle as that? He can. Otherwise, you can kind of get it off just fine. Okay, give me, yeah, either Perception or Investigation if you've got one that's better than the other.
Ratshit 00:55:19 You said perception? Sorry.
Kaladen Shash 00:55:22 the trained assassin, let him see. I'll do a sleight of hand.
Dungeon Master 00:55:44 Yeah, or investigation. I think perception is probably better for you, though, being wisdom-based. 17. And then, Kaladin, you can give me a slight a hand check. Yeah, you got it. 14. You see, at first, he gets away with the first one kind of scot-free. It's not super noticeable, but you see he's sort of
Kaladen Shash 00:56:03 Bye-bye.
Dungeon Master 00:56:12 like just very briefly brushes past Leopold as he's moving. And that itself is pretty subtle, but you see a flower sort of sprout out of the top of Leopold's where his ear would be sort of tucked on his horn. And if he had an ear, it would have been tucked behind his ear and look normal. But because it's a helmet, you're like, that was weird. Instantly picked that up too.
Ratshit 00:56:36 Silence.
Dungeon Master 00:56:39 It makes sense that these guys sort of work for you. They're not as subtle as maybe they'd like to think, because you're just picking up on everything they're doing. You guys still have the telepathic communication that won't be overtly obvious if you're having regular conversation with them, but if you guys have like a three-minute conversation in silence, he's going to know some things up.
Kaladen Shash 00:56:45 Yeah. I just, after I've clearly touched both Zaria and Neopold, I just make direct eye contact with Ratchet and begin to have a conversation with the other two.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:02 Just lots of meaningful glances.
Kaladen Shash 00:57:15 How much do you think he knows?
Ratshit 00:57:15 My eyes hit the ground. I cannot hold back contact. I cede. You're not talking to me, are you? Just kidding.
Dungeon Master 00:57:18 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:33 Well, it seems like he only would agree.
Leopold Magnus 00:57:38 Well, to be honest, I think this Donnie fellow knows more than he's telling us. Seems pretty sharp.
Kaladen Shash 00:57:47 Do you believe we can trust him, or does he know anything that's happening outside the wall? Hey. What, do you want to tell him everything? Do we ask him now? Kill him later?
Dungeon Master 00:57:54 You guys are so mistrusting.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:02 I say we ask. Yeah, ask him. We're pretty perceptive. Just throw a question out before he starts to get suspicious of our silence.
Kaladen Shash 00:58:16 Okay. Rachid, I have a question. The last expedition was unsuccessful outside the wall. We watched that. It's horrible. What do you know about beyond the wall? Can anyone inside check in?
Ratshit 00:58:18 I'm gonna be honest not a whole lot Not a whole lot
Zariel Torgan 00:58:36 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:58:47 You can do an insight check, and Ratchet, you do know a little bit about what's going on outside of the city.
Leopold Magnus 00:58:49 I'm doing an inside check.
Kaladen Shash 00:58:54 Bye.
Ratshit 00:58:57 Thank you. But I. OK.
Dungeon Master 00:58:59 So you can do persuasion or deception because you don't know a lot and you don't know what happened because there was this, to catch you up, there was this huge festival where they made a big deal about sending the first knight out in a long time to try to re-establish connection with one of the other domes because the northern dome called Moonhaven was like in current trade with
Dungeon Master 00:59:24 New New Arbor. And they're like the only two that were like still in connection because the the West Dome fell to the curse. That's where everything came from. East Dome fell during that war, and the North Dome and South Dome were sort of recovering. And then in the last like 10 to 15 years, the North Dome stopped communicating with the South Dome. So there was this big event where the O'Dears helped this artificer create this item
Kaladen Shash 00:59:37 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:59:54 that split the arcane dome so that a military party could sort of get out and explore the continent to go figure out what happened. And as soon as they stepped out of the dome, they were, like, I mean, instantly they were attacked by a giant werewolf that, like, shredded everything in front of the whole district's, like, the civilians' eyes.
Kaladen Shash 01:00:10 Silence.
Dungeon Master 01:00:16 And like this bloodbath and they shut down the gate and the dome closed and then the cult attacked the city and it distracted everything. But it didn't really take away from the fact that like it was a political nightmare. Everything went wrong that could have went wrong. You happen to know that the reason they were sending a group out to establish connection with the dome is that one of the teleportation circles that the core has access to.
Ratshit 01:00:31 you
Dungeon Master 01:00:45 has some semblance of a connection again out of nowhere but before you were going to teleport in there blindly they wanted to see from an outside perspective what was going on. So you do know that something is happening at the dome but you don't know what because that's like way above your pay grade. Yeah these guys have been a part of
Ratshit 01:01:05 Right? Is this something that I like wouldn't be allowed to share?
Zariel Torgan 01:01:05 She's creepy.
Dungeon Master 01:01:14 Think of the Legionnaire is like it recruits adventuring parties like mercenary parties and gives them contracts for work. So it's like a policing force that works through like the ideology of heroes kind of deal. These guys have been doing that for all of like two or three weeks. And they're absolutely not on that level. But they've shown their power in a pretty short amount of time. So it was like, hey, let's give them a shot if they keep showing up for this stuff.
Dungeon Master 01:01:39 But they don't know. They, like the rest of the general population, don't know that the North Dome has got some activity.
Ratshit 01:01:49 so I'll roll a check then against there
Dungeon Master 01:02:02 They're 9 and 16 and 19. 9. Kaladin, he seems on the level, man. Zarya and Leopold, he says that and there's like a little bit of stammering in his words and there's a little bit behind it. He knows something.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:03 I think that's.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:23 In the telepathic
Leopold Magnus 01:02:23 Well, come on, Donny, be honest with us. We think you know a little more than just nothing.
Ratshit 01:02:31 Yeah, well maybe I do, I'm your fucking boss! I mean... I can't just share everything, you know, it's only been... I've known you for what, three weeks?
Zariel Torgan 01:02:50 connection that we have, I think I'll just say, well, perhaps we just head back and, you know, share what we have to see what they hit us with. And just stick with our original plan. Doesn't seem like he's got anything too negative to say.
Kaladen Shash 01:03:11 Question is ratchet or direct superior now that we're like a little omen night squad No crap, that's right, that's right. All right. So yeah, that's right. That's right
Dungeon Master 01:03:19 Uh, in theory, yes. You guys know that you still have to formally meet with the Lord Marshal to, like, be given your next set of orders. So, like, Ratchet is still your boss, but you know pretty quickly that you're going to be leveling up. Not a deal. Not really.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:37 level 7.
Kaladen Shash 01:03:44 Yes, let's go. We can go. Yeah. We're calling him Donnie now.
Leopold Magnus 01:03:50 On the way back, can I ask Donny some questions? So, that's Leopold. He's more for formality. So, Donny, can I ask you, how did you get your nickname Rad Shit anyways? I always wondered.
Ratshit 01:03:54 perfect i mean the red shit is kind of growing on me to be honest yeah well you know i
Dungeon Master 01:04:09 Okay.
Ratshit 01:04:23 I don't really like the story, but there was a... I don't want to call it an accident in the basement of... I was trying to get some rats! It was pretty early in my career, I was trying to get some rats in the basement and I kind of got beat up by some rats, so everybody started calling me Ratchet. Even though I'm much stronger now than I was then,
Ratshit 01:04:53 You know, the nickname like that sticks, you know. A lot of hard consonants, you don't forget it. Thanks. Thank you, that really means a lot. It absolutely does.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:00 Well indeed, yes. That is quite an unfortunate origin story, but I do commend you for sticking with it.
Zariel Torgan 01:05:11 He says to his boss,
Dungeon Master 01:05:11 Really?
Kaladen Shash 01:05:24 Ratchet, do you trust Captain Levi? Do you believe what he says? Low bar, my friend, low bar.
Ratshit 01:05:30 Yes! And he's like a good guy, I don't know. He's basically the only person in the world that respects me, so that, you know, I kind of like him. Yeah, well, it's gotta be somewhere, it's gotta be said somewhere, and once more people start respecting me, then maybe, you know, maybe that won't be the bar.
Zariel Torgan 01:05:44 the fifth
Dungeon Master 01:06:00 Hey, you guys. Gradually, you guys are having this conversation as you're moving. You make your way out of the sort of lava tunnels, eventually making your way back to this open space. As you hit this map, this center spot right there was where you would drop down into the water tunnel that you know ejects you out.
Zariel Torgan 01:06:16 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:06:24 Ratch, you don't tell them this, but you do know that that beam that you saw was absolutely like the arcane source of the dome. And like that being down here is probably not good that anybody can find it. So in the back of your head, you would know, oh shit, I have to report this to somebody. But you don't say that out loud as you're sort of making your way back. And that was down sort of,
Kaladen Shash 01:06:24 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:06:53 This way down here. Do you guys make your way up through this tunnel you're making? You know that over here was how you got to the fight with Cedric and then this way over here was the way out towards the tunnel that led you to the chapel.
Kaladen Shash 01:07:16 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:22 Sorry, have we looked through this little tunnel here in the past? Oh, okay. So we've explored every, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:07:26 That's where you just came from. Yeah. Yes, you've explored the whole area so far, but you just know the different directions lead to different things.
Ratshit 01:07:46 Do you guys want to go back? Retrace your steps? All right. Here I go! I can't click on the thing, but I... Here we go back!
Leopold Magnus 01:07:54 Well, I'm pretty turned around here, so. If you could lead the way, that'd be excellent. Is that the one?
Zariel Torgan 01:07:54 Yeah, we don't have any reason not to go back, right? Yeah, I mean, yeah.
Ratshit 01:08:14 Thank you. Perfect.
Dungeon Master 01:08:15 to the tablet. Eventually, as you make your way through, it goes from the unworked rough-hewn stone walls to eventually support beams, established tunnel system, carved out, you find a maintenance tunnel that brings back, and before long, you have re-entered this underground chapel that you had found
Dungeon Master 01:08:43 Where you have these stained glass windows that shine in a light that shouldn't be there because this is underground but this is where you would have that enormous fight with the reverend and this is actually where Ratchet had gone unconscious and nearly died.
Ratshit 01:09:04 This place sucks. Can we get out of here? I lost my voice. Yeah, maybe my fucking vocal cords are there too. Thanks for pointing that out. My soft- my- my soft tissues. Just splattered. It's alright. It just-
Kaladen Shash 01:09:06 Whoops.
Zariel Torgan 01:09:07 Yes. Yes.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:09 I think there's some of your blood still over there in the corner, Ratshit. Oh. Yes. Indeed. So insensitive of me for pointing that out. I apologize.
Ratshit 01:09:29 I'm still thinking about that you expected me to heal in one night, it's just... I'm not gonna get over this quickly, to be honest. I suppose. I'm nuts and bolts.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:37 But I guess it might just be different for Zariel and I, to be honest. And I just kind of cling on my metal armor.
Kaladen Shash 01:09:45 Coming up.
Dungeon Master 01:09:47 Don't don't you guys walk through this space as you guys are walking everybody give me. Nature check. Or perception check. 1910 16.
Dungeon Master 01:10:14 I'm coming up.
Ratshit 01:10:21 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:10:21 13, Zario with the highest one. You guys are walking through this space and as you know that you're sort of down here and you're just kind of going to the staircase in the center, but as you sort of crest through the center of the room, you hear what sounds like flapping of wings come from beyond the stained glass. And again, you're in the bottom of a cave like this,
Dungeon Master 01:10:47 Worked stone buried Chapel. There is no actual light It was like magical before that sort of gave up but you do hear what sounded like bird wings from up there Oh And this this doesn't show it but the reverend had shattered glass when he made that sword that Caledon now wields and
Zariel Torgan 01:10:59 from behind, as in where there should be no physical space? Yeah. So I'll kind of stop everybody and say, hang on, let's take a look at this here.
Ratshit 01:11:00 Huh.
Dungeon Master 01:11:10 So like there is an open space that kind of falls off into void that you've seen before, but. Do you want to check it out?
Zariel Torgan 01:11:28 And I'll walk up to it. As I get closer, do I see anything more specific?
Dungeon Master 01:11:33 As you press the stairs and you're looking through the glass, you still don't see anything from this distance. We'll say you're like right here at this point. It shows that you guys are on it on the live stream at least.
Kaladen Shash 01:11:43 Hey, Jonathan, I can't see the map. Because I'm just waiting for you to send it. Yeah, it sounds like everyone else can see. I just don't know why I can't see it. I'm sorry, keep going. I'm going to relaunch my browser.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:58 I'm on it.
Dungeon Master 01:12:06 I mean, let me take it off and put it back on. But anyway, up to Zario on what he does with that. You guys, he says he hears something, but he didn't really explain what he heard. As he just sort of walks up and goes in and checks it out.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:32 Yeah, I'll just pick up a rock and kind of toss it. You say I do or I don't hear it. Is the sound getting louder?
Dungeon Master 01:12:35 Oh, now it's not loading. Interesting. You throw a rock and it just falls. You don't really hear it hit anything? You do not. No, you only heard it the one time.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:03 I'll explain to everybody what I heard. Yeah, it'd basically just be like, yeah, I heard some weird flapping for a second, and now it's gone.
Ratshit 01:13:12 You heard a bird?
Kaladen Shash 01:13:31 Don't hear anything else. Let's see. OK.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:36 No, it doesn't seem like it. I'm over here looking and I threw this rock in here and still nothing. Hey, it worked with the dragon.
Ratshit 01:13:45 Oh, so you threw a rock, so he cleared it. Sounds good. Well, I wasn't there for that. Can't deny that. I throw another rock.
Dungeon Master 01:14:09 You throw a rock, do you get up to like the ledge? As you walk up to the ledge, give me an investigation check as you're sort of throwing the rock over. Real talk, my like above VTT isn't loading any of my maps anymore. Something went wrong.
Kaladen Shash 01:14:35 Yeah. I'm just sitting in the dark. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:40 Yeah, it's showing me a map from outside the zone. I'll reload.
Leopold Magnus 01:14:46 I'm still in the church. Is that where we're supposed to be?
Dungeon Master 01:14:50 No, I think it's just because mine's being fluffy at this point. But moving on, we don't need it right away. There's nothing important. There's nothing visual that you guys can see. But what was that in an investigation check? Don't see anything from the angle that you're at.
Ratshit 01:15:08 And All right, I don't know man you just hear things
Kaladen Shash 01:15:23 I don't know. Nothing else looks different while we've been gone for three days about the church. No one came back for anything. 16.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:29 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:15:35 you can give me a perception or investigation check for where you're at.
Dungeon Master 01:15:44 16, what they failed to see as you sort of look over the edge, you see that on what would be like the close side of the wall beyond the glass as you're looking down. So it'd be like if you were in the void looking into the chapel, you would see it really easily. But since you're looking out into the void space, you can't see it. You see like arcane etching into the stone, a glowing like a faint purple, green, bluish sort of radiating.
Dungeon Master 01:16:14 A depiction of two birds. Pretty crude with some arcane. Two of them, to be exact. Like they're like corvid type. They look like ravens, crows, magpies, that kind of line.
Kaladen Shash 01:16:18 Not three. They look like the. It wasn't the albatross or the three for the wedding. What was the bird described as? Yeah. Just just what is that what these look like?
Dungeon Master 01:16:43 Yes, very similar. Oh, it's below it, but what languages do you speak?
Kaladen Shash 01:16:49 You guys, I see something down here. Look. It's two of the birds. We saw that in the caves. There were three of them. I don't see it. Three for the wedding, two... I speak of Sylvan.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:54 Mm-hmm. Is there any writing, like on the other ones? I think Kaladin's the only one that can read it.
Dungeon Master 01:17:18 What other languages? You could. It's not Druidic and it's not Celestial. Does anybody speak Dwarvish?
Ratshit 01:17:21 Turkish.
Kaladen Shash 01:17:21 I can do comprehend languages and know anything. Give me 10 minutes. Yeah. I'll just ritual cast comprehend person, or I'm sorry, comprehend language. Negative.
Zariel Torgan 01:17:27 I know Celestial, Common, and Druidic. Probably like Primordial or something.
Dungeon Master 01:17:53 Once you cast your Comprehend Languages, it is Dwarvish, and it says two for mirth, one for sorrow, two for mirth, three for a wedding. Wedding.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:02 So it was one for a wedding? Is it like a throuple?
Kaladen Shash 01:18:07 Three for wedding, one for sorrow, two for mercy. Oh, he left his live view up. I love it. I'm not looking at that.
Ratshit 01:18:16 wedding sounds like a bird sound like a thropple to me yeah i like that we could see
Dungeon Master 01:18:26 Are you Googling it right now? I love that. Could be ominous, some would say.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:29 Bad luck. We'll just have to see about that.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:39 That's great I'm I'm on the map. I'm good. I can move stuff Yeah, gotcha
Dungeon Master 01:18:50 Um, yeah, I keep reloading my page and it gives me like one single map that I definitely didn't make I think it's a little fucked Yeah, but I can't switch maps if I can't see them That makes sense i'm gonna close my chrome and reopen it um But it's pretty easy because you guys are just making your way out at this point. So you go from
Dungeon Master 01:19:17 this underground chapel which had access to from the main chapel of Ateo. So you guys go from underneath to the main floor out into the Don district. And from the Don district, you can find your way to the closest core wall that separates the districts. And then from there, make your way back to the core if you'd like.
Kaladen Shash 01:19:42 Okay. Pass this route. Picking my nose.
Zariel Torgan 01:19:48 Yeah, let's just get back.
Dungeon Master 01:19:51 Anybody doing anything on the way there?
Leopold Magnus 01:19:57 Uh, are we walking like for hours? How long is the trip? Donnie Donnie keep keep those hands to yourself. That is
Ratshit 01:20:01 I'm picking Kaladin's nose. Why did he look at you? I'm just trying to help, you know? I'm just trying to be a valuable resource to the team.
Kaladen Shash 01:20:13 Ratchet, we give you a new name. Get your finger out of my nose, man. What is this? God.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:28 What are you going to do with those things after you're done with them? Jonathan, how long is the walk?
Ratshit 01:20:34 Um, I didn't think about that I suppose.
Dungeon Master 01:20:43 What does he do with those things? It'd take you like a couple hours. Once you get to the core, it's a pretty fast track system. And it's like a direct line, so you don't have to sort of filter through the streets. But we'll say like a couple hours.
Leopold Magnus 01:21:06 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:15 Yeah, I'm ready to rock. I feel like we need to face the music and see what that's going to bring. But that's just me.
Kaladen Shash 01:21:22 Thanks, Louie.
Dungeon Master 01:21:23 Okay, yeah, you guys make your way through the, you're going through the core and like the general barracks to sort of get to like the main meeting rooms. And as you guys walk in, Ratchet takes the lead as he is technically the CEO and people have seen him recently. So even though he got some glances to start with,
Dungeon Master 01:21:53 As you guys are sort of in tow, maybe trying to keep to yourself a little bit, you can't help but notice everybody's heads are being turned. You guys, I mean, to recap what has happened, escaped through the tunnel system after fighting this, like,
Dungeon Master 01:22:11 nature infused divine pugilist, and then you fought a frog he met and then you backtracked through a cave system and got scorched by a red dragon before getting electrocuted by an arcane beam. So you guys look like absolute hell. And so everybody's Yeah, you slept, but like your clothes are tattered, you're dirty, your hair's fucked.
Kaladen Shash 01:22:20 But we slept.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:29 But we slept tonight.
Ratshit 01:22:34 That's what I've been fucking said.
Dungeon Master 01:22:37 Um, and so like, it's almost like this scary kind of thing where it's like, Oh shit, what the fuck happened to those guys? And you don't, it's up to you if you give them the day of it to sort of share glasses with them or smile or anything. Otherwise you guys are just making a beeline for sort of the meeting room. Uh, and then ratchet, it'd be up to you if you told them, um, that
Dungeon Master 01:23:06 only Caledon was to report to, the Lord Marshal and the other ones had been requested elsewhere.
Ratshit 01:23:17 Hmm. Um, I would definitely share that if that's what they told me to gather them for. Yeah. I mean, you might have to go. Do we have them here? I mean, it's kind of an ask.
Kaladen Shash 01:23:19 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:23:28 Well, Donnie, I respect those orders, but would you mind if I have a cold one? It's been quite the trip.
Ratshit 01:23:45 I felt it tells some underling to some paper pusher that may or may not be my boss. Get a beer. Perfect. Yeah, that's fine. That's OK.
Dungeon Master 01:23:56 You're generally the boss around here, so you can absolutely just look to some rookie and be like, go get us a drink from the common area. And also, you guys haven't shared that you found Cedric yet.
Kaladen Shash 01:24:18 I thought I told Ratchet we killed Cedric and the dragon.
Ratshit 01:24:19 He did.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:20 Yeah, I think... Yeah, he said we took care of Cedric and a dragon.
Dungeon Master 01:24:23 Okay. Yeah. The one thing that they had sort of chased after this guy to do, they've said that they've done, but, um, you also know that Cedric ran off with like this magical mask that had been on this unconscious woman, you know, long story short kind of deal. Um, you haven't seen the mask, but, um, it's good news that they killed this dude who is essentially like an urban terrorist.
Ratshit 01:24:51 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:24:59 I want to knock back a brew, just kind of like my helmet pivots up, splash a healthy glug of ale down there. And thank the recruit by saying, it's absolute hell out there. Would not recommend it.
Kaladen Shash 01:25:08 So. So.
Dungeon Master 01:25:21 I relaunched my whole fucking thing and I still don't have my map. That's, that's, that's tough. I'll just, I'll just do roll with the punches. Okay. Um, so yeah, you guys sort of knock back a couple beers, uh, and then eventually you go to like, basically like the split off point where like,
Dungeon Master 01:25:49 You know Kaladin knows how to get to the Lord Marshal's office, but they've never been high enough in the core to see anybody on the High Council, so this would be new for them. So you might have to help them with that. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:26:07 So I'm supposed to see Lord Marshall and they're going to the council, you're splitting us up? Whisper? Yeah, 100%. I say we... Go ahead, Leopold, let's hear it first. You're loudest, you go first.
Ratshit 01:26:08 OK.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:16 Did we want to take some time while we were drinking to telepathically get our story straight? So yeah, what are we thinking?
Leopold Magnus 01:26:29 Well, go on. I thought we had talked about Kaladin's accident, remember?
Kaladen Shash 01:26:46 We did discuss this. We said that my changes were because I pushed myself while we fought Cedric. My curse manifested a little bit. Just a little. Yeah, but we need to... We didn't. We were very deep underground. After we killed Cedric, we fell in some water.
Dungeon Master 01:26:46 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:53 Yeah, that's a good stance. How do we explain being outside of range? I mean, our comms didn't work.
Kaladen Shash 01:27:15 Extreme right there, not telling them the other hole. And say that we had to come back different way. Very challenging. Red dragon. Here's the proof. Correct. Correct. We didn't find the mask.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:25 Just stick to things that are technically true and just leave out anything that might not be. Yeah, that works for me.
Kaladen Shash 01:27:44 Don't tell anyone about this. Be cautious, be cautious my friends. Last time he knew a lot, Lord, Lord Thor knew.
Leopold Magnus 01:27:54 You got it, boss.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:56 Go face the music. Let's see what they have to say. Probably gonna get a medal. Yeah. Well, I guess we'll see what they have to say.
Kaladen Shash 01:28:12 Quite a bit about the mask and potential other things. Be careful. OK, just let Leopold do the talking. He will go great.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:34 Oh, well, I don't know about that. I'm not the smoothest talker, you know me.
Dungeon Master 01:28:44 Um, yeah, you guys, uh, you see, um, Kaladin, you sort of split off from the party and you make your way, um, towards, uh, the Lord Marshall's office. And then, um, we'll get to the other guys afterwards, but as you are, um, making your way over there, do you do anything about your impair appearance or you just sort of.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:44 I think it'll be all right.
Dungeon Master 01:29:11 Fully committing to the I pushed myself and this is a curse manifestation Yeah, and I'm still working on getting
Kaladen Shash 01:29:17 rather than push myself because I can't I don't have any disguised self whatever something that would be good enough for their level of sort of scrutiny or whatever else sticking to it the curse
Dungeon Master 01:29:43 His face set up, but I got a different map. You make your way to. I moved you guys over. It didn't move you over on the map, did it? This is killing me.
Kaladen Shash 01:30:04 No, I still don't see myself or a map. I don't know if anybody else sees anything other than the church still. Cozy, regal, lots of wood.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:11 Yeah, it's a church.
Zariel Torgan 01:30:12 Yeah, I got the church.
Dungeon Master 01:30:15 Why now of all times? Anyway, you're back in, I don't know if you remember, the Lord Marshal's office. Yeah, like stone floor is very nice. He sits at his table at the far end.
Kaladen Shash 01:30:35 Oh, yeah, there we go. We'll move again.
Dungeon Master 01:30:44 And as you make it to that point, Kellan, you step in and you see he looks up and you notice the same thing where he does look very tired, maybe even more so than when Ratchet had seen him a couple days ago. But then he looks up and he goes, sit, please.
Dungeon Master 01:31:10 Hasn't looked up at you yet, but as you make your way up and you sit he looks up and you see like a flash of surprise across his face. It's like obviously he's now noticed your appearance change. And he he breaks the silence first by just going. Seems as though you've had a rough go of it.
Kaladen Shash 01:31:36 Yes, fighting Cedric was a challenge. Yes. He's dead. Yes, the mask.
Dungeon Master 01:31:39 I trust that you were successful then. Wonderful. And the mask. Secured, lost, anything that might help us with this woman?
Kaladen Shash 01:32:04 uncertain about its location, that's all. He didn't have it when he killed him. Good luck, that's why we were lost for three days. It's a maze down there.
Dungeon Master 01:32:13 That's frustrating. Do you think it's worth sending a crew to search the areas that Cedric was at? Right. Obviously not what we want to hear. But can't do anything about it, can we? Listen, there was a reason that I pulled you
Zariel Torgan 01:32:27 Smart.
Dungeon Master 01:32:41 Separate, I feel like you're a little bit more on the level. Damn, I meant to pull Ratchet in here too as well, but it's okay. We could fill him in later. Sorry for the delay of it all, but I wanted to formally extend the offer, the advancement to Omen Knight. You guys have worked hard for it. But it comes with a bit of a caveat if you bear with me.
Kaladen Shash 01:33:12 Please let me know so I can tell your dears what we are waiting on. Is this what you expected to see when you open the dome? The storm? The werewolf? None of it?
Dungeon Master 01:33:18 Glad to hear it. Obviously, our excursion out of the dome was a disaster. A werewolf? No. Oh, well, weather always changes, I suppose. That's the benefit of living under the dome is we sort of control the seasons as we will.
Dungeon Master 01:33:48 with our druidic inclined folk. It was quite the storm out there though, but no, I didn't expect to see a lycanthrope right there. If you ask me, it sounds a little staged. You see his eyes level with you as he had had that previous conversation with you where he had flat out said that he thought something was up and that everything was set up.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:56 March.
Kaladen Shash 01:34:17 Yep.
Dungeon Master 01:34:19 And he goes, I've been digging into it and I don't know who I can trust on the council. And nobody's heard from the first council in a while, but that's, that's not unheard of. He's quite the important man, but would you be willing to meet with some trusted individuals if it came to that?
Kaladen Shash 01:34:47 What are you asking me to do other than meet?
Dungeon Master 01:34:52 But I'm unsure. I need to see if you think he can be trusted. I will reach out to him expressing my concern with the integrity. I mean, to say it out loud seems a little ridiculous, but the integrity of our governmental body. I think he looks to again.
Kaladen Shash 01:35:18 Who is this person? Who are you speaking of? Who will you speak with? I was told you wanted to see me and only me. They're off to see the Council, I believe.
Dungeon Master 01:35:24 And he looks at her and he goes, where's the rest of the party? Well, I wanted to see you, but where's Trevor? You see his eyebrows raised. He goes, who on the council requested to see him?
Kaladen Shash 01:35:48 I don't know. Ratchet was asking for them directly to go there. Can I telepathically, can I telepathically ask them that where they're at? Great. It's a tight, a whisper calm. Then it's all, that's fine. I'm going to just go whisper calm. Zariel, where are you?
Dungeon Master 01:35:54 There he goes. It only lasts 60 feet. You could do the comma system. Then it's all audible. Yeah. At the same time.
Zariel Torgan 01:36:17 Um, where are we at this point?
Kaladen Shash 01:36:20 What is your 20? Yeah, easy.
Dungeon Master 01:36:24 We'll hide this token and we'll go. We're just using the same map because you know. Things didn't work out for me there, but you guys you are. You like walk to the center of the core and you haven't seen this technology before, but Ratchets pretty confidently leading you forward. You hit like a very nice area of the whole place and eventually you like step onto this like.
Dungeon Master 01:36:54 arcane teleportation circle. It's smaller. It like fits two of you at a time, sort of shoulder to shoulder. But it teleports you to a different level in the like the core itself. And you step into this hallway and you see like this beautiful cityscape where you see the full from like your perspective, like a 60 degree pie slice of city, like a whole section of it.
Dungeon Master 01:37:23 If you're so high up, you're like almost to the cloud level and you realize you're probably like an almost what would be considered restricted access before. But Ratchet sort of walks you down the hallway before stopping out of an office building. And as you walk up to the office building, you see a plaque at the door that says, Lord of Advancement KW.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:56 Does he take us in or? Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:37:58 Did you hear my message? No, but on the comm, on the comm? Oh, I spoke out over the whisper comm, yeah. That's what was told me.
Dungeon Master 01:37:58 He doesn't end in right away. He does not hear the message because he was beyond that 60 feet and this is all sort of simultaneous. Do you speak out over the comp? Okay. Yeah. You guys do hear then because your Legionnaire comp systems work through the city.
Dungeon Master 01:38:20 You hear a very whispery message in Ratchet, you hear this too, of Kaladin reaching out to the whole group. Not in yet.
Ratshit 01:38:35 Um,
Zariel Torgan 01:38:36 I'll just say, yeah, we're up high at the Office of Advancement or whatever it said. Yeah, we're still out front. Understood.
Kaladen Shash 01:38:45 It hasn't gone in yet, correct? Be careful of deception. Don't say more than you have to.
Zariel Torgan 01:39:11 And we... Okay. All right, I'm good.
Kaladen Shash 01:39:18 Jonathan, what were the initials on the door or the name?
Dungeon Master 01:39:22 Uh, it says lord of advancement. So, you know, uh, and this would be common um, like Uh knowledge of anybody who lives in this city, but of the high council there are six positions And I got them all written down somewhere but Where did I put it
Dungeon Master 01:39:51 Okay, there are uh, there's the lord marshal. So this is ur your sort of uh Highest ranking people you ever met but then there's also Lord guardian of the land There is lord master of currency There's the lord high healer And you know that that position was what? um
Dungeon Master 01:40:16 High Father Kalor was sort of petitioning for and that one rant that you guys watched where he was giving like a sermon. He was talking about how there needed to be a change in office and he was going to go for the council seat for sort of the cleric order. And then there is Lord of Advancement and finally First Council which is like the most powerful mage in the city.
Kaladen Shash 01:40:22 Oh, okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:40:45 Would we know any other? I'll do one. Ah, Jerry Dwight.
Dungeon Master 01:40:45 And you can give me a history check if you know who currently holds those spots. 30, 20, 13, 18. Ratchet can make one too. He might not just know this.
Kaladen Shash 01:40:53 Go. 18.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:03 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:41:22 for a dirty 20 is pretty good. You just sort of access. You've got almost a photographic memory. So you when you were trying out for the Legionnaire, you sort of memorize the system of the city sort of just to get a heads up on it. Do you want to know any specific names? Or do you think you'd know all of them?
Kaladen Shash 01:41:27 Silence.
Leopold Magnus 01:41:46 Um, let's see. I don't know if I would know necessarily all of them, but I wouldn't necessarily know which specific ones I do know. Mostly interested in, I guess, maybe a name, but like a brief, what do they do? Like, what are they well known for? Like, you know, who the person is just kind of like a high level biography.
Dungeon Master 01:42:09 Yeah, this one sort of interests you more than others, maybe almost fanboying about this. Lord of Advancement currently is being held by a very elven male, almost pureblood elven male by the name of Calmera Windrider.
Dungeon Master 01:42:34 In the lord of advancement position is a position of like the person in the city responsible for like technological advancement. Pushing the sort of boundaries of.
Dungeon Master 01:42:46 the magic spells, power levels, you know, sort of the, the four leader on like automaton technology and power cells and like all of like, he was like the person who would like modernize, um, arcane lamps that sort of power the city, like, um, pretty smart guy. And his job is very like artificially based. So this is,
Dungeon Master 01:43:15 Like, somebody might interest you to be meeting, but you would also know that the current High Healer of the Dome is a person by the name of Milo Bramblethorn. Do you know Lord Marshal Thurr? The Lord Master of Currency's name is Gundar Copperforge.
Dungeon Master 01:43:38 And you would also know, I'd say maybe you don't know the other ones as well, but the first, everybody knows the first council, like the highest ranking mage of the whole city is a figure known as Thava Stormsinger. And they're like, it's rare, which is why everybody knows that they're like a dragon born mage. And they're very old. It's sort of, people make rumors and jokes about how long they've been alive.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:08 Okay. So we didn't necessarily have time to stop by the bunk, I guess. We pretty much came right here. Okay. I mean, but we just found out that we're going to the Lord of Advancement. We don't, we didn't know that in advance. Got it. Hey, Zariel.
Dungeon Master 01:44:18 You could have. You said you threw a couple beers back. Yeah, you didn't know that before you got here.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:34 That toolbox you have, I wouldn't mention anything about it if I were you. Yes, of course. I think that's about right.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:41 I mean, yeah, it's a good call. We did get it from the lottery there, but seeing as how we haven't really used it much, and I'll wink, I shouldn't feel any need to bring it up. I'll give a knowing nod that I know what he's going for.
Dungeon Master 01:45:09 Then. That shit, are you going? With them, are you going to stay out?
Ratshit 01:45:20 um when sir had told me before say like i was requested by the high council i i feel like i wouldn't uh go in if i wasn't specifically requested considering who it is so i i think i would stay outside well you guys could go in they asked for you
Ratshit 01:45:53 If you want. But you should.
Dungeon Master 01:45:53 You guys step in. You guys step in and Ratchet will step, stay out and he will stay just sort of heads back to like his level at this point. So he would rejoin Kaladin in a little bit moment. But as you guys step into this room, very similar in how like lavish and
Zariel Torgan 01:45:54 All right, let's do it.
Dungeon Master 01:46:15 almost gaudy that like Lord Marshall throws in but you notice the difference is that Lord Marshall being a very militaristic man he like keeps himself very small in his space and he pretty much only ever at his desk working on like papers and stuff but you walk into this room and you see they're like
Dungeon Master 01:46:33 fountains lining the windows, it's just sort of like give off a nice smell along with the water like you get like lemongrass through the air and you see really high tech advanced sort of automatons with like intricate gear systems.
Dungeon Master 01:46:52 Artsy as the word have been used described earlier in some of them in design but they're like in servant roles were one of them is carrying a tray of beverages. And standing at the corner and sort of waiting to be summoned another one is sort of just like at the window not super doing anything at the moment but just like. In between tasks and you see this.
Dungeon Master 01:47:14 Elvin gentleman sitting at his desk, long sleek black hair that sort of sits to his shoulder. He's got pointed ears that like very obviously are being presented by like the way his hair frames to show off his heritage, and he's got gold metal caps at the top of his ears to sort of really accentuate the points.
Dungeon Master 01:47:35 He's got fine features, no facial hair, very fair skin. He's in this nice black silk-like gown robe that you would see mages wearing. And he, as you guys walk in, he stands, bows, and he goes, please have a seat. I've been waiting to see. And you see, instantly, he, like, little shuffle steps in excitement directly towards Leopold.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:08 He's like coming in hot. I think, is he getting like pretty close into my space? I'm just going to kind of back myself into a corner. Oh, that's close enough. To be honest, I have a little bit of a personal space issue.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:08 the
Dungeon Master 01:48:11 Like excitement, he sees you and he's like walking to you. Yeah, he's not gonna stop. You see, gives a nod and hearing you speak gives him more excitement.
Dungeon Master 01:48:40 grins uncontrollably like again almost like sick hobby enjoyment level of like he like is very excited you see he pulls up his wrist and you see like a magnifying glass spins up to the top and then a bunch of little ones spin in front of it each smaller than the other and he like looks through it to try to get a closer view at your gears from where he's standing we'll say like five or so feet away um and just to himself interesting you know i
Dungeon Master 01:49:11 seen a design like this recently. And then Leopold give me as he's talking just. History check. As you are being like investigated by this guy and he goes. Now, I must say, when I heard that there was a sentient automaton joined the Legionnaire, I knew I had to get my hands on you. I mean, you are fascinating.
Leopold Magnus 01:49:41 Well, I'm not some object to you, and I kind of push him back away from me. The name's Leopold Magnus, and I am a fine legionnaire overnight. Thank you very much. And I spin around and I point at the bone crusher symbol on my back shoulders.
Kaladen Shash 01:49:49 Silence.
Dungeon Master 01:50:01 As you spin around and you lose eye contact with him, Zariel, give me an insight check. 19, hold on, hold on, hold on. Get away from my slow ass that I'm meant to do this thing.
Zariel Torgan 01:50:08 Yeah, this guy's giving me weird vibes. Uh, 19?
Dungeon Master 01:50:31 rolling manually with an 11 does not beat yours. Um, Oh, then it rolled. That one doesn't count. It took too long. Um, he instantly makes eye contact with that symbol instantly. And like he locks eyes uncontrollably for too long before peeling his eyes off of it. Like,
Dungeon Master 01:50:58 He just saw a ghost. And then he goes, now that is even more fascinating. You seem fully independent of any command. Would you say that's correct? A robot, of course.
Leopold Magnus 01:51:11 Independent of any commands, who do you think I am? Well, that is absolutely incorrect. I am not some mindless automaton. I'm Leopold, and I have the ability to control myself.
Dungeon Master 01:51:27 You see with a swish of his hand, a green mage hand sort of floats to the air and taps on the shoulder plate. And you hear that just ding ding as it's like a hollow thud underneath. And he goes, well, not to disagree with your rights, but you are very much just a suit of armor.
Leopold Magnus 01:51:51 Leopold's just staring at his hands.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:51 Well, it doesn't seem like we came here to discuss my friend. I was told we were here to be a part of some sort of briefing.
Dungeon Master 01:51:59 Well, on the contrary, I... No, misunderstanding, of course. I really was just interested. I've heard rumors of this figure in the Legionnaire. Tall, metallic figure. Seems to bounce back incredibly quickly following any sort of attack on his form. Metal, sort of self-bending. Capable of arcane spell casting and...
Dungeon Master 01:52:28 quite opinionated. I had to get a look for myself.
Leopold Magnus 01:52:37 I'd take a look around the office, see if there's any interesting things that this guy's been working on.
Dungeon Master 01:52:46 Uh, give me, yeah, perception check. And then Zariel, you had insight of 19. That's pretty good. You see, he is like very obviously looking all over at Leopold, but you see, he keeps glancing to you and he studies you a little bit and then he switches off and he studies, uh, Leopold way more obviously. And then he's like, I sort of dart back to you. Oh, not one.
Kaladen Shash 01:52:49 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:53:14 Leopold you I think are sort of struck with how uncomfortable this is making you with him being so close in your space it's just like sort of hard to get your thoughts together because he's like like in your chassis almost he's like looking up in your gears and stuff sort of from a distance though but he's like really looking up in your shit man like he's I'm molesting you right now.
Leopold Magnus 01:53:40 Getting in there.
Dungeon Master 01:53:40 very fascinated with how you function.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:48 Seeing how this is playing out, I think I'm just gonna say, well, we've made your acquaintance. Unless there's some sort of directive keeping us, we really should return to our friend Kaladin. He is giving an account of our absence and I imagine it would be rather important for us to aid that discussion.
Dungeon Master 01:54:17 After speaking, he does cut you off and you see a sudden sharpness and almost rudeness to his tone. He goes, yes, I, Lord of Advancement, requested your presence. You will be quick to obey.
Dungeon Master 01:54:34 And he sort of walks a little less excited in the steps, like little quickly and some hardness to a step to his desk before pushing his chair back, sitting. And as he sits, you see some sort of magic sort of brings it up underneath him. And he sits and he twists his neck one way to the other, cracking it, sets his shoulder, and he puts his hands up on the table, sort of like fingers pressed out, fingertips just touching, but his hands are spread. And he goes, let's see, and that's one for,
Dungeon Master 01:55:04 Pleasantries, we'll make this quick. I am fascinated by your partner here. Not so much as a request as I will be seeing more of you in the future, but I heard of his autonomy and, pardon, I heard of your autonomy and I wanted to give a shot to asking you yourself. I would like to experiment, a harsh word for it, but I'd like to analyze
Dungeon Master 01:55:35 your being. I've been working on advancing the city's technology somewhat recently and while I have made some pretty ingenuitive designs as far as soldiers and knights of metallic form that are, you know, solely focused on serving, I mean the potential of a
Dungeon Master 01:56:00 An automaton that can think and feel and command itself in the heat of battle without waiting for a command is... It's unheard of. So again, sorry to make it seem as though it was a request, but... When will I be seeing you again?
Leopold Magnus 01:56:26 Well, I'm not going to be some science experiment for you. So I think you'll have to find somebody else to request meetings for, and I'll just turn around and store milk.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:26 He's directing that. Towards Leo. Yeah, I'll stand up.
Kaladen Shash 01:56:31 Too good.
Dungeon Master 01:56:39 You see the door shuts as what was behind the door you recognize very quickly as, and you know this because you guys made a check on it before, each of the High Council has a Blackguard Knight, which is, and for Travis to fill you in, the Blackguard are essentially like, I imagine there are only five Secret Service
Dungeon Master 01:57:04 like top-notch best of the best fighters assigned to the most important political figures of the city. Each of the high council has one that sort of follows them around. You hadn't noticed it. Well, I guess he's not here, is he? This is just what he would have noticed if he was, but you guys know this with your checks. As you go to turn and walk out the door,
Dungeon Master 01:57:25 a Blackguard knight closes the door before you can leave, still unspeaking, unmoving, and you recognize its form to be very similar to the one that you had encountered on the outside of the dome. Not exact. This one doesn't look quite as, like it's almost bridging the gap between what would be like Leopold's technology level and the other one you found, which was like incredibly modern and sleek and like,
Dungeon Master 01:57:53 compact, the one that's sort of in your pocket tool shop right now. But yeah, so the door closes in front of you. This guy you would pretty quickly put together and from what he said, designed the Blackguard Automaton Knights.
Leopold Magnus 01:58:02 So this guy has a prototype model, essentially, of the Omenite we found, or the Black Garden. He just has an older model.
Dungeon Master 01:58:21 He has, yeah, like the one that you found was so advanced that it for all intents and purposes moved completely humanoid and fluid. It was only when you approached it and you saw sort of its armor sort of ripped open after it had been killed or knocked unconscious by that like werewolf encounter outside of the city. Like you didn't know it was a robot until you saw its insides. This one is not quite as smooth. It's like, it's close.
Dungeon Master 01:58:48 way more high-tech than your suit of armor, but it doesn't show any sign of a motion life or independent thought.
Leopold Magnus 01:58:58 Right, I got it. Well, I suggest to you that you move this two-bit Tinkerton out of my path and let me leave right this moment.
Dungeon Master 01:59:15 He looks to you, Zariel, and you're with him on this.
Zariel Torgan 01:59:22 Well, we're not really ones for threats. When you ask nicely, you get a lot more of what you want. More bees and flies with honey, as they say. We were under the assumption this was a
Zariel Torgan 01:59:42 employee or employee type situation. This seems like a bit of a abuse of power, at least in a human resources sense.
Dungeon Master 01:59:54 I understand your concern but potentially only one of you is human as far as we know. So sorry for that misconstrued information. I hope you know that it reflects rather poorly that you are being subordinate but the Lord Marshal did in our last briefing at the council say that he had a rather ornery group of recruits.
Dungeon Master 02:00:22 Well, I do look forward to your advancements in the Legionnaire. Know that I will not be, I won't stand against you, but I will not be acting in your benefit. This was, all intents and purposes, rather disappointing." And he looks at the other knight, and with like, it's very insulting to the name, he just goes, the victor too, they can leave.
Dungeon Master 02:00:48 and the door opens at the whim of the black guard. And you guys are essentially not directly ushered out, but you get the sense that you can leave.
Zariel Torgan 02:00:59 I'll give a Kurt bow, and I'll say to Leo as we're leaving, big fish in a small pond. And we'll just head out. This is Ratchet still waiting outside for us.
Leopold Magnus 02:01:12 Oh, yes, indeed.
Dungeon Master 02:01:21 Did he stay or did he walk off? In this meantime, what has Ratchet been doing?
Ratshit 02:01:22 I thought. I had. I'd gone back to my desk and started just doing some paperwork. Basically, my whole life is just filling out.
Kaladen Shash 02:01:34 Nevermind, it's what I do.
Zariel Torgan 02:01:35 Well.
Dungeon Master 02:01:40 As you're walking back to your desk, you pass the Lord Marshal's office, and you see that as soon as he looks up and he sees you, he like gestures you to enter the room with him and Kaladin. And there hasn't been this much time at this point. This is like concurrently with like the conversation that the other two are having. So he ushers you in and goes, Captain Farsighted, Sergeant Farsighted, sorry, is your title. You're a sergeant, not a captain. And he goes, please.
Dungeon Master 02:02:12 I know that the Council had requested to speak to the others, but I didn't know that was so instantaneous. Was that information relayed to you or was that to Levi?
Ratshit 02:02:27 I mean, I was there. I already forgot his name, but I tell him. Which one? AW.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:35 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 02:02:39 And then he goes, a little bit of a story, and he goes, great. Who pulled them from our meeting? Which of the members? Lord of Advancement, he goes. Kalmar, you snake.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:56 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:03:05 Full honesty, he looks to you, Kaladin. He's been really harping down my neck about the potential of Leopold. He seems really fixated on his form more than anything. I hope they're well. But anyway, now that Ratchet's here, sorry, now that Sergeant Farsight's here, and he sort of flushes a little bit, he goes, I wanted to offer this to you as well.
Dungeon Master 02:03:34 There have been some openings amongst the Omen Knight ranks with the unfortunate loss of Blazer, Lazer, and Tazer. We're looking for some new people to sort of take up that mantle. Would you be interested in also advancing through the ranks? Oh.
Kaladen Shash 02:03:50 This man crying, that's good. Donny, get a hold of yourself. It's almond night now.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:56 Oh.
Ratshit 02:03:57 I start weeping. Just openly weeping. I love that! I've just been working towards this for a long time. I will gladly accept to prostrate myself.
Kaladen Shash 02:04:21 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:04:27 But.
Dungeon Master 02:04:28 Great. You've never had this much emotion in the 10 years we've worked together. That's great.
Ratshit 02:04:38 Well, you know, my soft tissues. I'm just, I'm having a really hard, I'm just having a tough week but I make, I make it do.
Dungeon Master 02:04:58 Well, beyond you guys getting access to... Really, you can move up to the Omen Knight floor of training. I'll stay down here with the common troops, but you'll have more access to supplies. You'll have a new CO. Unfortunately, Ratchet, you won't be, so to speak, top dog at that level. You'll have to sort of fight for a position of leadership again, but... I'm happy to give this to you guys.
Dungeon Master 02:05:28 Of note, Donnie, you will need to see Hamhawk to get an upgrade to your armor, but feel free to take these guys with you if you'd like. Beyond that, he sort of makes like a leveled look to you, ratchet, and he'll you hear in your head
Dungeon Master 02:05:53 through a spell that he has access to. He goes, I'll have you stop by in a bit for a debriefing on what actually happened. But then out loud, almost at the same time, he goes, good work, Kaladin. Sorry about that woman. You seemed, of the group, to have the biggest attachment. And without the mask, I'm afraid she'll just be stone.
Dungeon Master 02:06:25 You know what, actually, I'll be in touch with the High Healer. Maybe he's got access to something that can fix this. You bet. That's all I've got for you guys. You guys are excused.
Kaladen Shash 02:06:36 Thank you. Excellent. I look at Rachid and say, Rachid, where do we get tokens for finishing the mission? Is that still you?
Zariel Torgan 02:06:54 Mm.
Dungeon Master 02:06:56 Oh, yeah, you didn't. It absolutely is. As part of anybody who finishes like an actual assignment, like their contracts, the all of the troops over the years have put together this system where they've donated magical items they found they didn't want.
Ratshit 02:06:56 Oh, couldn't possibly be me. None of them.
Dungeon Master 02:07:21 into this, like, arcane lottery. So if you finish the contract, you get a token, you can put it in and get a random magic item, ranging in ability. And since you also... Yeah, you're the one who gives them the tokens normally, but you now get to take a pull from it as well because you finished your assignment.
Ratshit 02:07:30 And I would just have these on me. Yeah, here you go. Nice job. Proud Papa.
Dungeon Master 02:07:53 hands you each token.
Zariel Torgan 02:07:54 We probably heard about it.
Kaladen Shash 02:07:59 This moves travels fast.
Leopold Magnus 02:08:04 Donnie, is all that soft tissue that got mixed around doing okay up there? And I kind of tap him on the noggin. Never seen you quite cry like that before. Or wait, we're not in the room, are we? Got it.
Ratshit 02:08:20 I was crying really loud.
Dungeon Master 02:08:25 I will say about this time you guys sort of show back up to this level so you see everything happen and you do see how it in and. Ratchet you would see that maybe is a real and leopold look a little unsettled by the encounter they have and then.
Dungeon Master 02:08:47 Leopold and Zariel, you would see, like, dried tear marks down Ratchet's face, and Kaladin looks a little, like, anxious by being next to him.
Leopold Magnus 02:09:00 Yeah, that's what I'll point out. Well, to be honest, I had a lot of respect for this organization until today. Absolutely not. The Lord of Advancement. I did look up to him at once, but no more.
Zariel Torgan 02:09:01 Yeah, they didn't exactly treat Leo with much dignity, acting like you.
Ratshit 02:09:02 What happened to you guys? You don't anymore?
Zariel Torgan 02:09:29 Not a very progressive outfit, unfortunately. Yeah, not very impressive.
Ratshit 02:09:38 I've heard he's kind of a douche
Leopold Magnus 02:09:43 Well, and to be honest, he doesn't even know what he's doing. Zariel, did you see that model of soldier he had on him? If he's got one of those by his side, he's incapable of making better, as far as I'm concerned.
Zariel Torgan 02:10:01 Yep.
Dungeon Master 02:10:01 Um, Leopold, go ahead and give me just cause I don't know if it was not caught versus caught. Um, like, and you just didn't do it in character, but would Leopold have caught that he referred to his black guard as being Victor too?
Leopold Magnus 02:10:23 Right, yeah, there is, uh, implying Victor some, some interesting relation there. What, uh, what did you want me to roll? Got it. Got it.
Dungeon Master 02:10:32 Cool, just wanted to make sure that you had picked up on that. Oh no, you already noticed it. I was like, if Rex had missed that I said that I would have Leopold roll to see something about that, but you picked it up that it was some sort of hint towards backstory stuff and this guy's got some sort of tie to it, but. There would have been nothing else that you could have rolled for at that time.
Leopold Magnus 02:11:01 I see. Oh, damn.
Dungeon Master 02:11:03 I also figured out what happened to my maps. Technically, I fucked it up. I was having trouble getting Travis into the campaign page, so I reset the campaign link. And if you reset the link, you reset your cloud data. So I wiped my maps, not realizing that.
Kaladen Shash 02:11:09 Okay.
Ratshit 02:11:10 I knew it.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:12 Oh bummer. That sucks. Gotcha.
Dungeon Master 02:11:25 Well, luckily most of them are like saved pictures that I just uploaded and made really big. So like the city map, I can just put back really quick and all that stuff. But you guys would not be able to revisit a lot of the battle because I just found those on the fly. So don't, don't, don't try me is what I'm saying. I would like to try something else. It's gone. That's why everything's gone.
Kaladen Shash 02:11:41 That's OK. Are we taking a? Are we taking a trip to him hot that's happening? Bull that.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:45 I'd like to immediately go back to the dragon fight. Do we want to do tokens first? Is that something we could do while you're doing that?
Dungeon Master 02:11:58 Oh, shit, I gotta get that. Oh, yeah, because we don't need a map for that one.
Ratshit 02:11:59 Yeah, I give a couple tokens to the others as well.
Leopold Magnus 02:12:06 Yeah, let's do that.
Dungeon Master 02:12:08 So how this works, just for the first timer, Travis, you can go last or first or however, it'll be a D100 divided by two. I've got a list of items randomly put together from something else. And if it's already been taken, I take the closest number to it. But you just get a random thing that can be super beneficial or super not.
Kaladen Shash 02:12:10 Mother. All.
Zariel Torgan 02:12:34 Who wants to go first? Why don't we have Ratshit go, since he has never gone. Hey Donnie, can I have like three of them? Can I have like a few? I mean, you're chaining them out.
Kaladen Shash 02:12:40 That's it. Donnie, Donnie, rip it up.
Ratshit 02:12:44 It's my first time! My first time doing the thing! I'm pulling the lever! You're asking for more tokens? Yeah, I knew that. What I meant was... It's been a while.
Dungeon Master 02:12:47 It's also not his first time. Donnie, your, your axe and your shield came from this machine. So you have used it before when you were like actively getting contracts, but it's been a while because of your position in the Legion era. Like it just hasn't been something you could do. And it's always really fun.
Ratshit 02:13:14 I just miss doing it. Okay. It's huge.
Dungeon Master 02:13:17 I don't know if you guys believe him.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:18 Spent a big day for him.
Kaladen Shash 02:13:32 38.
Dungeon Master 02:13:40 Okay. You take this token, and it's like a giant slot machine put in, like, enchanted. It looks fun. The soldiers designed it, so it really is not fitting for, like, military, but it's more of, like, R&R in, like, the break room kind of deal. You insert the token, you pull the lever, the wheels spin randomly, just doing random arcane symbols, and out of this little dispenser at the bottom is, like, an egg.
Ratshit 02:13:56 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:14:05 and you crack this egg and inside of it you see a thin blue steel ring and embedded in it is like a tourmaline stone. It is very cool to the touch and that's all you can tell at this point.
Zariel Torgan 02:14:28 would you get? He's a suit of armor. He's got no mouse.
Ratshit 02:14:28 Look what was in my egg! It was a ring. Clap for me, it's tradition! You wanna eat a plastic egg? You've never gotten a... a gumball?
Leopold Magnus 02:14:33 Oh, oh, yeah. So, well, it was good you didn't eat that. I would have been tempted to eat that egg, you know, to be honest, and appetizing. Oh, it's plastic. I didn't notice.
Kaladen Shash 02:14:35 He doesn't need, he does not, he does not eat the food. You know, he's big machine.
Ratshit 02:15:02 Yeah, that makes sense. Understood. That makes more sense.
Dungeon Master 02:15:04 random things pop up but they they for sure because you've watched them do this they've gotten an egg and leopold has eaten an egg in the past and it was plastic but he's robotics i can't tell
Zariel Torgan 02:15:13 What about you, Kaladin? Why don't you get up in there? Ooh. Ooh. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:15:13 Okay, seven, nice, lucky seven, very low, very low number. I guess three and a half, three and a half, number to two.
Dungeon Master 02:15:39 Mm-hmm. Do you want three or four? Oh, well, three has been pulled, so it'll be four. You pull the lever, the wheels spin, three of them lock in a row, and then same deal.
Zariel Torgan 02:15:43 Yeah, we'll take the one above and the one below. Uh-oh. Bree was pulled? Oh my god. When did somebody get that low?
Ratshit 02:15:48 Let's try.
Kaladen Shash 02:15:51 Excellent.
Dungeon Master 02:16:09 little egg rolls out, about a fist-sized egg, a little bit bigger this time. You crack it and you see in this egg is like this fist-sized glass ball and swirling inside this ball is like this silvery smoke.
Kaladen Shash 02:16:30 Okay, give me a minute. I'll identify give me a moment guys. I'll tell you what it is
Zariel Torgan 02:16:32 Sweet. What do you say Leo? Do you want to get in there? All right, I'll step up and I'll pop my thing in the slot.
Ratshit 02:16:32 us.
Leopold Magnus 02:16:48 Well, you take it for a spin. I'll round the bass last. 42, I think.
Zariel Torgan 02:17:00 88, looking at 44, lucky 44. 42, yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:17:05 Everybody says that lucky 44. That's 42. Oh, this one's cool. You see, um, um,
Kaladen Shash 02:17:09 I like the number of the universe, whatever. Look at you. Oh, there you go.
Dungeon Master 02:17:22 you pull the lever everything spins locks into place and you see the dispenser that has been like dispensing almost fist size eggs suddenly expands to be almost the size of like your entire torso and rolling out at great speed is this enormous egg that like falls into your lap do you crack you crack it and you see inside of it is this
Zariel Torgan 02:17:42 Oh, hey, oh. Hmm. Hey, that's pretty cool. This could replace my shield I've got, depending on if it's any good. Galadin, you think when you're done with that, you could take a peek at this for me?
Dungeon Master 02:17:48 perfectly round, shiny, silvered shield. So shiny that it's almost got a mirror finish. So you look into it and you can see yourself.
Kaladen Shash 02:18:13 Yes, you got it. Chrome like Chrome. So we're standing.
Zariel Torgan 02:18:15 Absolutely wonderful. Hmm. Could use this to check for vampires. It's the cleanest thing I own.
Leopold Magnus 02:18:15 Is it reflecting light like kind of like a watch face would? I see, okay. Boy, isn't that, isn't that thing spiffy, Zario? Well, that's not hard to do.
Dungeon Master 02:18:22 No, it's metallic and he looks into it and it reflects his face. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:18:47 I'll step back and admire and give you the floor. Guidance. Oh, 98. Hot damn.
Leopold Magnus 02:18:52 All right, I'm gonna walk up and I've actually attached a small piece of string to my coin and I'm gonna drop it into the slot and I'm gonna try and pull it back out. 98. You divide that by two? Yeah, I guess so, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:19:01 Yeah.
Ratshit 02:19:01 Sure.
Dungeon Master 02:19:09 98. What is that? 49. You see as you spin it and all the wheels lock, the size of the dispenser goes right back down to being pretty small in fist size and you get a, what would you consider like a normal size plastic egg, shoots out.
Zariel Torgan 02:19:18 Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 02:19:40 Oh, dear. Oh, I always have to stop myself. Not eating these things is a hard thing.
Dungeon Master 02:19:41 And you see when you crack inside of it, there are two almost look like skipping stones in appearance. They're somewhat flat and rounded, but there are two of them. And they would fit into like your palm of your hand. They have a little bit of like arcane runes scratched into them.
Zariel Torgan 02:19:58 You got a nice set, Leo.
Dungeon Master 02:20:06 But you don't know anything about them unless you sort of attune to them, but you'd have two magical-ish stones.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:16 Zaria, take a look at these stones, and I'll just kind of hold them down about waist level. Yes, I'm quite lucky.
Zariel Torgan 02:20:33 Do we get a chance to see what these things are? Do you have them loaded up or do you need to make them still? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:20:40 I have to make them as items, because I didn't know what you guys were going to roll. And I wasn't going to make 100 items just out of that. But we'll start with Leopold's item first. You pulled, once they get identified, the Stones of Sparse Speech. So by attuning to each of them, so each person would have one,
Kaladen Shash 02:20:47 term.
Dungeon Master 02:21:04 While you touch the stone, you can use action to cast the sending spell from it without expending a spell slot with no restriction to word count. It targets all the bears of other stones, so in theory there could be more, but there's only two. And if no creature bears the other stone, it's not received at all. But you know that it wasn't received, you get that feedback instantly.
Zariel Torgan 02:21:14 Hmm Interesting any anything You
Leopold Magnus 02:21:30 Interesting. What's the range on sending? Oh, you can go between planes. Oh shit, okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:21:30 Forever. It's got like a 95% success rate. It'll make it. Okay, okay.
Dungeon Master 02:21:35 anywhere on the same plane of existence, and you can do over planes of existence as well if you'd like. Yeah. Ratchet pulled the Ring of Frost. While attuned, you have resistance to cold damage.
Zariel Torgan 02:21:43 It's insane. Nice. No eating soup with that hand.
Ratshit 02:21:54 oh let's fucking go that is role playable stunning
Dungeon Master 02:22:00 Any beverage held in the same hand as the ring becomes frosty and refreshing. And that's kind of all it does. It's just total resistance in that. You pulled the anti-gravity sphere.
Kaladen Shash 02:22:01 What is this? What is this order?
Zariel Torgan 02:22:18 Nice Oh
Ratshit 02:22:31 That sounds cooler than mine.
Dungeon Master 02:22:32 It is one-time use. One-time use. You, as an action, can throw the sphere up to 60 feet, where it shatters and casts Levitate. DC save 15 for your spell save on all creatures and objects within a 15-foot radius, lasting for one minute with no concentration required.
Kaladen Shash 02:22:59 Okay, what kind of saving throw, did you say Dex or? Okay, okay. Let's hear about this guy.
Dungeon Master 02:23:02 It just does spell save DC 15, so it'll be whatever the levitate spell uses. If it has one, otherwise we would just do a general arcana, you know, 8 plus proficiency plus whatever their intelligence is kind of deal will make it work. And then finally. You pulled the shield of heroic memories.
Zariel Torgan 02:23:21 All right, sweet. And then what about my shield?
Kaladen Shash 02:23:30 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:23:32 This perfectly round silver shield has initially a mirror finish. You gain a plus one to AC in addition to the shield's normal bonus, so it's a plus two shield. As you defeat creatures in battle while holding this shield, you gain a further plus one bonus on any subsequent battles with those creatures while holding the shield. The events of the battle are intricately engraved onto the shield's surface once they have concluded.
Dungeon Master 02:23:59 You may also attempt to recount past battles, both real or imagined, to the shield. Upon a successful DC Charisma Persuasion check, if truthful, or a Charisma check but deception, if deceitful, you gain the plus one bonus against a creature described while holding a shield. Three failed attempts cause the shield to be cleared of all its memories. The engravings disappear and it reverts to its mirror finish.
Zariel Torgan 02:24:26 Hmm. So I get a regular plus two, but if I fight a creature I've fought that type before, then I get an additional plus one. Interesting. Gotcha. Okay, sweet. So it's just, yeah, sweet. Yeah, that's awesome.
Dungeon Master 02:24:35 becomes a plus three, you can lie to it and make up a battle and get a temporary bonus against the creature. But if you fail it three times, the shield wipes and it just goes back to being plus one shield. I think that was all the items.
Dungeon Master 02:25:06 Okay, so you guys at this point are in the rec room. Where were you heading? You were heading to Hanhok after this, correct? I was working on finding the thing that I had used for her lab particular, but I found one that was close enough. So we'll use that one.
Kaladen Shash 02:25:16 That's correct.
Ratshit 02:25:18 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:19 Yeah, sounds good.
Dungeon Master 02:25:38 And then I see, Rex, you're still on the chapel map. Has it updated? Are you able to look at where the new one is if you reload it? Weird. They've been at the smallest thing, just the generic one that I had before that I could find.
Leopold Magnus 02:25:47 Yeah, let me see. No, still getting this. Are you guys seeing something else? What's that? Oh.
Kaladen Shash 02:25:51 Just the chapel, very interesting. Yeah, the office. I see a new...
Dungeon Master 02:26:06 That one was pretty easy to get back to. I really fucked the pooch on that one with deleting it.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:12 Yeah, I'm still in that cathedral.
Kaladen Shash 02:26:21 It's a whole building of some sort. It's cool, we're calling this Ham Hock's shop. Oh, yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:26:39 Anyway. Yeah, we'll call this one just for now. It's just like imagine artificer. Uh, lab, but super high tech in the sense that, uh, just for physical description for ham hock, it is a large sort of. Uh, gender neutral, but, uh, you know, to be female, like ogre-esque.
Dungeon Master 02:27:05 humanoid like huge compared to all of you guys. Ham Hawk is looks pretty stupid but like very smart overall has like a pretty thick accent when they talk but um Ham Hawk outfits the Legionnaire with like upgrades to their armor and also has been working with Leopold on some side projects here and there.
Leopold Magnus 02:27:30 I'm her apprentice, thank you very much.
Zariel Torgan 02:27:33 Eh.
Dungeon Master 02:27:35 Not true. Yeah, but as you guys make your way up to, Hamhawk's shop is technically in the Storm District. Let me just pull up, as we're talking, I'll make that map its own thing too.
Ratshit 02:27:36 I can do the narrator.
Dungeon Master 02:27:59 Um, but you enter that out and you see that the large ogre-esque woman sort of in like the back room that they're normally in as she, uh, is like just working on something as you enter. Hey, look who's back. It's, uh, my favorite fucking rascals and whatnot. Uh, what can I do for you?
Kaladen Shash 02:28:15 M-Hawk, hello! In their infinite wisdom at the Legionators, they've made us Omen Knights. We get more toys and upgrades.
Dungeon Master 02:28:36 Let's see, uh, Hamhawk shoots you guys. Look, uh, you did already get your armor upgrades. She goes, yeah, right, I'm not helping you guys out. But she looks and she goes, well, well, well, well, if it's not Sergeant Farsight, a.k.a. Ratchet, you finally made it. Well, I'm
Ratshit 02:28:54 Hey. How you doing? Hello. Another promotion. Don't worry about my voice. Don't react to my voice being different. Everything's fine. I am just very wounded. Yes. Oh, thank God. Thank the gods that you know about the soft tissues. There's not many.
Zariel Torgan 02:29:07 Huh.
Dungeon Master 02:29:07 It's not, you sound like they damaged your soft tissue or something. Hey listen, I didn't know we sound like this either. They fucked up my soft tissue after one of my first combat encounters. It's a tough one. They just fucking get it wrong.
Ratshit 02:29:28 It's intubation. It shouldn't be. Yep. Now you need the doctor to do it. These nurses. They fucked me up. Burfed my veins, trying to start the IV, and then I can't do it. Three tries to intubate me. Can you believe it? Fucked my soft tissues. Anyways, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:29:44 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:29:53 I believe it, trust me. Oh, I get your driftbone. Yeah, I mean, what you're looking for as far as
Ratshit 02:29:56 I finally got a promotion! One tear falls. So that's pretty exciting if you can hook me up with the good shit, not the rat shit if you get my drift.
Dungeon Master 02:30:21 equipment goes, you rock a pretty standard outfit. Are you looking for anything in particular? Yeah, I mean,
Ratshit 02:30:29 No, I don't. I'm not a flashy guy. I don't have a lot of flashy style. I'm just kind of here to help out for the greater good, you know. So, well-rounded and just the standards that will do for me.
Dungeon Master 02:30:47 That's fair. I'll whoop something up. I won't be super rushed on it, because, you know, God forbid you get demoted as soon as they find some other schmuck to be in Old Midnight, you know? What are the chances of that happening? Yeah, wouldn't happen. I'll work on something else. But, hey, Leopold, while you're here, I wanted to show you something.
Ratshit 02:30:59 Hopefully though
Leopold Magnus 02:31:11 Oh, yes, yes, Ham Hock, your faithful apprentice at your service. Oh, sure, whatever you must say, Ham Hock. And I lean into the group and shake my head. I go, I'm her apprentice. Just kind of spin awkwardly, stare right at her.
Dungeon Master 02:31:17 Not my apprentice. I'm right here. You did not walk away from me when you said that. Anyway, I've been working on the frame of that energy sword that we mentioned.
Zariel Torgan 02:31:18 but
Ratshit 02:31:32 My next focus.
Dungeon Master 02:31:48 It's been a few days. Any luck on finding something power this sucker? One energy. Yeah, I mean that's um and you see like
Leopold Magnus 02:31:54 Well, I have some ideas, but I need a battery. Something to store this energy. For the sword, to power the sword, of course.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:06 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:32:13 They sort of move their large figure to the side and show you like on a very like intricate sort of stand suspending it up like on this little point so they can work on almost all aspects of it, this nice cylindrical thin handle that has like these.
Dungeon Master 02:32:29 very very much smaller uh like risers on the side to sort of initially guide the flow of energy but you see they made all of these little inscriptions in arcane runes and they bridge together these pieces with like this arcane soldier and they've like put together this handle to sort of project this beam out like you had suggested and um you see him off to sort of like almost looks lost and she goes right yeah we we talked about
Dungeon Master 02:33:00 Remember how I was like real stoked on this fire sword and then you had mentioned that like. In theory we could sort of balance out the flow of energy and just have a stable beam as a weapon and that was pretty sick and I said. Hey if you happen to find like an arcane power source that could sustain something like that bring it back and we could work on it and you said you would do that you remember that remember that happened.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:23 Uh huh. Uh huh.
Leopold Magnus 02:33:24 Yes, I do remember that discussion. Like I said, I've been working on it. I'm taking some notes. I think I might have the right idea, but I just need some more components.
Dungeon Master 02:33:39 Okay. Uh, more time. You got it. I just, you, you were so quick about the arcane splitter. I just, I don't know. Sorry. I guess I assumed you guys could do anything. Um, anyway, I'm not working on anything else right now. Um, so I guess I'll get while working on Donnie's shit here. Um, gives you a hard pat on the chest, a little too close to the throat with their like large mitt of a hand. Oh shit. Sorry. Um,
Ratshit 02:34:01 Yo, this G.I. almost gagged!
Dungeon Master 02:34:08 Would hate that. Give me till I guess I can get you some stuff in the morrow. I'll go work on the other part of my shop and I'll give you Rex the chance to do this. I mean, if you wanted to do something like steal the handle, you could. Otherwise, with your like knowledge of like blueprinting stuff, you could take note of like the supplies required to build your own energy weapon.
Leopold Magnus 02:34:35 OK. Yeah, I'll take some notes about it. I guess also I was wondering if I'd look around the workshop. Obviously, like this magic is channeled through the city, right? It's kind of I'm imagining that some of these devices require portable sources of power. Right, right, right. But something that
Dungeon Master 02:34:47 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Beyond that, though, you do know that you have the power source you got from the chest of that Blackguard.
Leopold Magnus 02:35:06 I said I'm looking for a battery to charge up, for example, you know, not not necessarily wanting to tender over the heart. Ah, OK. Got it, OK.
Dungeon Master 02:35:15 It was not necessarily the heart in itself. You know that figure had like a bunch of these sources in their like their chest cavity. You didn't get the idea that this was like a super special one. You just were able to charge it with that arcane, the core beam.
Kaladen Shash 02:35:17 Or.
Leopold Magnus 02:35:33 Very, very, okay, that was one thing I was worried about. Okay, so, yeah, I'll, I suppose, let on more than I did in our discussion with Hamhawk, and I'll say, well, actually, Hamhawk, I did find something quite interesting, and I don't wanna reveal the workshop, so could I say I just have that in my inventory?
Dungeon Master 02:35:58 Yeah, I figured you guys have that body in the workshop and then you had the source on yourself.
Leopold Magnus 02:36:04 Got it. Yeah. And I kind of bend over and start shaking my chest cavity up and down until a whole bunch of random things fall out, like little plastic eggs, a couple of pieces of chewed gum that got in there somehow, you know, like a soccer wrench. And then this kind of throbbing magic heart power source falls on the ground.
Dungeon Master 02:36:29 And Mark turns around and goes, what the fuck is that? She goes, when did you find that? Like the last 10 seconds? Like what happened to what you said before?
Leopold Magnus 02:36:33 Well, I think it's something that could help power this sword. Well, it was rattling around in there, and I just had to think about how to get it out. To be honest, it got kind of stuck. It was a little awkward. It was underneath this breastplate, and I'll kind of bend a little bit, point at the seam.
Ratshit 02:36:34 Beautiful.
Kaladen Shash 02:36:51 Silence.
Zariel Torgan 02:36:53 If.
Dungeon Master 02:37:01 Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm fine, yeah. I got you. I got you. Don't get nervous.
Leopold Magnus 02:37:02 Sometimes things get kind of stuck in there, and it's a little embarrassing, and I didn't want to make it more embarrassing. Yeah. Well, it's a convenient place to store things, you see. I mean, it's quite a large void space.
Ratshit 02:37:10 Maybe if you didn't swallow so much chewed gum, stuff wouldn't get stuck in there.
Dungeon Master 02:37:32 the fanboy um hammock goes um right uh and then zariel give me a slight of hand checking how obvious you're being with like your fucked up arm but you see hammock sort of has again i lost the picture on it because it was on that map but has those spectacles that have the folding down magnifying glasses like the big coke bottle goggles essentially over their eyes and really peers at this arcane four and goes this is
Zariel Torgan 02:37:53 Mmm.
Dungeon Master 02:38:02 This is some high-tech shit. Where did you get this? Fuck me, this is in the caverns? I gotta go down there more often.
Leopold Magnus 02:38:09 Well, we came across it, you know, it was something that was in one of the downed, you know, in the caverns.
Kaladen Shash 02:38:19 Ooh.
Dungeon Master 02:38:34 I mean, uh, this is I don't want to say it's above my fucking level. But, um, I'm not so good with this kind of stuff. Um, it's, it's really, it's, it is machine, but it's, it's like, if you look here and you see like, um, all of like the magically inclined people who can communicate and like, or had the, the intelligence board have these sort of like thin glass projection screens where they can pull up ruins and images and stuff on it. Like, uh,
Dungeon Master 02:39:02 um early edition of like a tv for this fantasy world and they sort of transfer the image of this uh core you hold on to and they're like kind of zoom in to show you the intricacy of it they're like if you look at this here you see um like the metal itself is bent with magic so like it's it's much more arcana based than
Dungeon Master 02:39:28 it is any sort of Artificing like something you and I would do and and you see like they start casting a spell on it and cowden and leopold would recognize it To some extent and maybe even ratchet because he's got spell Capability as well as like detect magic On it pulling that up and you see she goes well, fuck me. It's not even just our cotton like this is
Dungeon Master 02:39:56 There's the power that was initially stored in here. I see that you filled it with something slightly different, but it took on the same aspect. This is almost necromantic in origin. It's not just energy bound into this, it's almost like it's life force. Powerful shit. This should work great.
Kaladen Shash 02:40:15 Peace.
Leopold Magnus 02:40:22 Life force, you say? Do you think a machine could have life? I'm just staring at my hands again.
Dungeon Master 02:40:29 That's a, that's a loaded fucking question. I'm going to avoid that like the plague. Um, as you guys are looking at this sort of brought up image and you see hammocks not really paying attention to any specific spot. So give me just a perception check. Anybody who's in the room as you're looking at it, as they're like almost 3d viewing, turning it, analyzing it, looking at it, you see like the, the, the thin metal is bent around in certain spots.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:30 Oh, hehe.
Dungeon Master 02:41:00 to be given this like really sophisticated shape and you see like arcane runes scribbled in certain spots jesse you roll so high on perception every time 22 21 um everybody but leopold sees it because dc 20 on this one as a ham hock is like mindlessly turning it over
Kaladen Shash 02:41:11 Roll the rock part.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:11 It's pretty good.
Dungeon Master 02:41:23 incredibly small etched into like one of the metal banding that goes around the central like power core like they have some sort of precious gem that stores the energy that's encased into everything and and enchanted on one of those tiny schemes you see this little etching of the initials k w and then they like come off of it and rotate through and
Kaladen Shash 02:41:49 Bravo.
Dungeon Master 02:41:53 go, yeah, I mean, this is perfect for this. I feel awkward for saying it, but I'd be happy to buy this off of you for this weapon if you'd like. Or maybe we can work out a deal with some working hours in the shop. Like I said, if you scratch my back, I'd scratch yours, so to speak. Nope.
Leopold Magnus 02:42:14 Well, to be honest, I've been your apprentice for some time now, and I'd just appreciate it if you recognized that fact.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:21 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:42:23 Really not how this works. I didn't have an apprentice. You came in for some gear one time, I sent you on some errands, and then you came back and you said, I was your master and you were my apprentice. And that's just not how this works. Oh.
Leopold Magnus 02:42:39 Well, I guess then if it's not the relationship, I better find another master, and I'll just take that core back with me. Sure yourself!
Zariel Torgan 02:42:51 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:42:53 Bummer, um... Could I at least, like, take a scan of it to try to build my own in the future? I mean, I don't know that I'm anywhere near skilled enough for this, but, uh... I'd like to be able to work on it. Hey, I didn't say that you couldn't be my apprentice in the future, I just said you weren't already.
Kaladen Shash 02:42:54 Flex in. Nope.
Leopold Magnus 02:43:06 No, no, no. If you do not need an apprentice, then you do not need this power core. Well, I just don't understand. I thought we had a very clear relationship. We were working excellently together.
Dungeon Master 02:43:32 Oh, fuck. Um, yeah, well, here you go. Sort of like open palm, let that roll down the fingers into like your gauntlets. It was, um, I'll keep an eye out for one of myself. Um, friendly competition. First one to build that wins. Right. And you see like a little bit of like primal competitiveness, sort of like burn behind their eyes is like you, you gather as soon as you leave this building, they're probably going to start working on their own core.
Kaladen Shash 02:43:36 you.
Leopold Magnus 02:44:02 Right, so in the time that we were there, can I try to, I don't know, investigate the sword design so I could similarly replicate the sword? Maybe.
Dungeon Master 02:44:15 Yeah, go ahead and give me a, you can do Arcana or just Intelligence. They might be the same, but Arcana might be better. And then Jesse, you had gotten a 16 on that sleight of hand. Let me just roll to see. I got a natural 19 on the die. 27, yeah, you like instantly printed into your brain
Kaladen Shash 02:44:27 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 02:44:37 Yeah, 27.
Zariel Torgan 02:44:39 but but
Dungeon Master 02:44:42 That everything you need to recreate this like arcane handle this like energy weapon that you would be able to basically build your own lightsaber right. Even though you're old pretty high Zaria you're like.
Dungeon Master 02:44:58 awkwardly sort of holding your hand behind your back a little bit and you see Hammock takes notice of it but like very particularly it takes notice of the fact that like on certain parts of your arm the parts that can be seen because it's really hard to hide now you have like metallic aspects showing through your like torn up armor and cloth and like it very you can it's really hard to hide it at this point unless you like replaced your clothing and you haven't had a chance to do that yet
Zariel Torgan 02:45:28 I'll just, uh, I'll just clock that and I don't know, I kind of want to wait until it becomes an issue. I'd really like to get a glove for it or something at some point, but we've been a little on the run.
Dungeon Master 02:45:30 takes notice but doesn't say anything outright about your arm.
Dungeon Master 02:45:59 And that is all I had for Hamhawk. And then honestly, we could call this session there. I didn't plan on it being any encounters. I figured it'd be like a little downtime stuff. But if you guys wanted to move towards like your next thing, we could set up for like an encounter to start the next session.
Kaladen Shash 02:46:03 Can I have given Hamhawk the dragon scales just as I have these? Think about some upgrades you can give me.
Dungeon Master 02:46:26 Yeah, you see a hammock goes, oh shit, Kaladin, you're here too. You've been so quiet. Holy fuck, are those dragon scales? Um, I mean, excuse the fuck out of me, but where did you get these?
Kaladen Shash 02:46:32 Yeah. Look, I get some stuff from our adventure as well. I pull out five or six dragon scales. Yes, very observant. Very good. Well, we killed dragon. That's how you get dragon scales.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:59 Eh.
Dungeon Master 02:47:00 Right, right. Sorry, pardon me for being so fucking stupid, but we live in a domed city to be protected by... from threats such as dragons, which notoriously live above the central planes of fate that we sort of inhabit, roughly, right? So...
Dungeon Master 02:47:22 At what point in being in this city did you guys find dragon scales? Because if you have a guy, I gotta know this guy. I work for the Legionnaire, what are you talking about? What? Did I fucking piss in your guys' cheerios or something? Why are you holding so much bag?
Zariel Torgan 02:47:34 Quit asking questions.
Kaladen Shash 02:47:34 We have our resources at the Legionnaire, don't worry. That's okay. We were deep in the caverns. We were deep in the caverns. Come on. Enjoy your work. We got dragon scales.
Ratshit 02:47:45 Awesome.
Dungeon Master 02:48:03 Yeah. You're looking for a shield or a chest plate, gauntlets, boots, helmet, what you're looking for? Yeah, we can. She sort of looks you up and down. She goes, you've been putting on some muscle recently. As far as like,
Kaladen Shash 02:48:13 Uh, perhaps new chest plate upgrade of that and my one shoulder to brace her. Um, I'm wearing half plate right now. Medium.
Dungeon Master 02:48:31 Metagaming-esque conversations. What kind of armor do you feel comfortable wearing? Like, how heavy are we making this? And you're sticking to it? You want something heavier? Something lighter? Mm-hmm. Yep. Don't want to do that.
Kaladen Shash 02:48:43 You need more than half plate. No, I like the, because the heavy, I become, I'll have a dex disadvantage. Yeah. No, so just keep it up at medium. Maybe it'll just have some resistances or whatever you want to do.
Dungeon Master 02:49:05 Okay. Um, she goes, I'll, I'll add that to the list of things. I've got Donnie up first, just general upgrades to his gear. I've got, you have, uh, some dragon scale armor you want to make, um, points at Leopold. You are withholding something really cool for me. And that hurt my feelings, but I get it.
Leopold Magnus 02:49:33 Well, there's one quick way to change that, Ham Hock. Indeed, I would like to be an apprentice, but quite frankly,
Dungeon Master 02:49:38 I said you could be my apprentice in the future. I don't understand where our wires got crossed. You see sweat visibly coming off, like, lower brow, like, it comes over their eyes really heavily with, like, their ogre-esque face, like, starts sweating, and you see, like, uh, like, the moisture is glistening a little bit.
Kaladen Shash 02:49:44 It's not future. Just say yes now, make agreement, and it's yours. Make agreement, sir. Right now, we will watch.
Ratshit 02:49:55 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:50:09 Yeah, sure. We can write something up. That's no problem. Uh, yeah. Mm-hmm.
Zariel Torgan 02:50:13 mhm
Leopold Magnus 02:50:17 Amhok's going to draft me a contract? Amhok is just kind of like, you know, rank and file, right? OK, yeah, I guess I'll ask. One momentary thought, Amhok, what do you know of the
Kaladen Shash 02:50:36 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:50:48 Chair of Automation, what were they called? Sorry. What do you know about the Lord of Advancement? Okay, good, I'll be your apprentice.
Dungeon Master 02:50:51 Lord of advancement Calmera fucking douche What really because yeah he um, oh
Ratshit 02:51:03 Rice head.
Zariel Torgan 02:51:03 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:51:10 Came out of nowhere, really. Nobody had heard of him. He just sort of was this aspiring mage when he showed up. Some, I think his background says he was from North Dome back when communication was still up. But, I mean, genius of a man. He is, say what you will, he works really well with advancing the cities. A little more skilled than I am, but,
Kaladen Shash 02:51:36 Jonathan above table didn't didn't they lose communication like I thought it was like 100 years ago or hundreds of years ago. OK, OK. Awesome.
Dungeon Master 02:51:36 Nah, he's never really had quite the brain for inventing more than enchanting. It's his kind of specialty. No, North Dome and South Dome were the last ones to be in contact with each other and it's like a somewhat recent change that they aren't in communication.
Dungeon Master 02:52:03 West Dome fell from the curse, East Dome lost communication like hundreds of years ago, and then North Dome and South Dome were like intermittent trading supplies, things weren't looking great, and then North Dome went for it.
Kaladen Shash 02:52:09 Okay. Sweet.
Leopold Magnus 02:52:27 Okay, well, let's get this show on the road.
Ratshit 02:52:27 I'm going to give her one thing real quick before we go. I'm going to say, can you take this ring and maybe make it a little bigger and throw a cup holder on some armor for me to keep Bev cold? That'd be sick.
Zariel Torgan 02:52:42 but but
Kaladen Shash 02:52:45 Hello.
Dungeon Master 02:52:48 You see her face slacks and then tights from where she goes. Are you asking me if I'll take this ring? Turn it into a cup holder and put it into the honor. You son of a bitch, I'm in. No, I just.
Ratshit 02:53:04 I don't—was I not speaking clearly? Yes, I would like that very much.
Dungeon Master 02:53:13 Shares a look with leopold. This is what happens when people share what they find No, that's fine friendly competition Sweats a little bit more Happy to share obviously she goes ratchet. I would love to get you some
Zariel Torgan 02:53:17 mhmhmhmhm
Kaladen Shash 02:53:20 Silence. Silence.
Leopold Magnus 02:53:21 Oh, well, that was your apprentice. I'm happy to assist.
Dungeon Master 02:53:42 A beer koozie. I would love to get you a beer koozie. Beyond that, and then you see, like, just making some small talk and then before too long you get the, like, intercom message through your armor that sort of just is from Captain Levi as he goes, now I'm not sure what you all are up to, but
Ratshit 02:53:49 Perfect
Dungeon Master 02:54:09 I've got another assignment if you guys are up to it. Take a couple days off if you'd like, but I think you'd want to hear about this one. OK.
Kaladen Shash 02:54:25 Respond, OK.
Leopold Magnus 02:54:28 Jonathan, did you say, okay, so Hamhawk refused my proposal.
Zariel Torgan 02:54:30 Oh, Jesus!
Ratshit 02:54:31 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:54:38 Just giving you shit. If you want to give the arcane core over, they already have the handle assembled, so it'd be much quicker. But the implications of that, because you're not a dumb guy, you're pretty smart. Hamhawk works for the Legionnaire, so likely if they figured out how to make this weapon work,
Dungeon Master 02:55:00 the legionnaire would have access to this weapon on like a mass scale whereas if you built it yourself with the arcane core you would be like the sole person who would have this weapon.
Kaladen Shash 02:55:06 But.
Leopold Magnus 02:55:12 Right, okay. Yeah, yeah. Maybe I'll try to get the relationship between hammock sorted, see where the chips fall in the near future, but I'll take that part with me. Did I get a read on what is gonna be required to make it? Got it.
Dungeon Master 02:55:31 I'll get you a list once I make one up, but just like some precious metals, some gems worth a certain amount of money, things like that, things you can buy if you like look in the market district kind of deal.
Kaladen Shash 02:55:44 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:55:49 But easy enough to do with a little bit of downtime if you guys would like. But again, I wanted to keep things rolling just so we set something up. And then we can go above table for a little bit. I don't want to do Hamhawk's voice anymore. It's killing my throat. But Travis, you were moving. But the weekend you were moving, we were going to do an in-person D&D session.
Zariel Torgan 02:56:06 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:56:15 I figured the chances of you being to join, being able to join something the weekend you're moving was like unlikely. But I don't know. Yeah, that's what I figured.
Ratshit 02:56:23 Very, but that's fine. Send it obviously. Yeah. Yeah. Perfect. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:56:30 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:56:32 Yeah, we're gonna do it. We've been planning it for a couple weeks. But the great thing about Ratchet is he can jump in and out. So we'll just keep it moving and then we'll have him come back in. Or if you have your own character, Ratchet would get demoted and the other guy could jump in. That was one of the funnier things when the giggle happened about it. You guys, make your way back to the car.
Leopold Magnus 02:56:48 Poor, poor Ratchet.
Ratshit 02:56:53 This goes back to.
Dungeon Master 02:57:00 Let's say with the way you've slept in the way back and everybody you've talked to like bridging on almost into the evening You hit back into like the conference room. This was like the basic wooden table. This is where um Well, you guys are official I wish I had the master this is a bummer I had like a whole omen night level for like your guys's upgrade but You guys will say you're on the old floor for now and then we'll do everything fun When I can do it. Um
Kaladen Shash 02:57:22 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:57:30 in the normal room captain levi is there with his paperwork and everything and um donny you sort of make your way to your side of the table that's like next to him And this is news to you because you've been out all day So when he said that they had a new assignment, this is something you hadn't heard of but captain levi goes um Yeah, if you guys are ready for this again take your time on starting it but word is spreading of um
Dungeon Master 02:58:00 there have been some, how do I phrase this, um, lycanthropic type creatures spotted in the Storm District. Um, no clear connection to the attack when we sent those soldiers out, but that was the first werewolf we had seen in a long time and to have something pop up so soon after makes us think this is worth following. If you guys are
Kaladen Shash 02:58:07 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:58:29 interested in it, I have been given word formally at this point that if you successfully find whatever the source of this rumor, this monster, these monsters, whatever it is, your next assignment afterwards would be, if you guys are accepting, exploration towards the North Dome.
Zariel Torgan 02:58:55 Mmm. Absolutely.
Kaladen Shash 02:58:59 Yes, we'll do the first step.
Dungeon Master 02:59:04 OK. And then same assignment briefing that you guys get always, where it's very bulleted for ease of writing down. It says, like, case number 2,253, not important necessarily. But then it goes, assignment, eliminate lycanthropy in Storm District. Next bullet point, last known location, club near Southern portion.
Dungeon Master 02:59:32 Next bullet point, three infected and neutralized, not isolated to lupine forms. Next point, consider extremely dangerous, find head of pack. And that's underlined below that standard offering of
Dungeon Master 02:59:52 250 gold pieces for each of you upon completion, or you take a cut of that off and you get 150 with the token for the arcane. And so Captain Levi's like walking you through this and he goes, again, just to get this clear, are you guys looking to take any sort of downtime before we start this or should I offer this? Do you guys want to take it and take some time? Should I offer this to another group?
Kaladen Shash 03:00:22 No, take it. Don't worry. Don't know what you're talking about.
Zariel Torgan 03:00:23 We're on it.
Dungeon Master 03:00:26 Wonderful. Um, let me know when you started on the case as a, I technically oversee the storm district and get you some clearance into some buildings. I've got some contacts in there to make it a little less tedious for you guys. You guys don't always have the most, um, nonchalant fashion of entering places. Couldn't, couldn't fucking tell you. Um, anyway,
Ratshit 03:00:47 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 03:00:57 See you guys on the flippity-flip. And he goes, just sort of like awkwardly looks towards the door and sort of like moves his eyes like, hey, get the fuck out. Cool. We'll pause there. Good place to end. Nice beat. I'm super bummed about the map thing, but I didn't realize I was going to do that to myself.
Kaladen Shash 03:01:07 Very good.
Zariel Torgan 03:01:09 Yes. All right. Roll out. Yeah. Having used VTT as the DM, that would be pretty devastating. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. I had prepped like. Mm-hmm.
Ratshit 03:01:25 All right.
Dungeon Master 03:01:31 Yeah, like all the math store, that's killer. And then you go back to the page and it so clearly warns you where it says, if you press reset invite link, you will lose all your cloud data in red and framed in a box. Yeah, most of it's like our photos on my computer.
Leopold Magnus 03:01:45 But you said you have most of them stored so you can reload it. So you said we're going to have a few days here before the
Zariel Torgan 03:01:45 Yeah, that's unfortunate.
Dungeon Master 03:02:00 We'll just take time to reload them and scale them and everything, but I can do that. Yeah, essentially you guys will have some downtime because you guys look pretty rough. Get time to repair your armor, give you time to go shopping if you want to, because you guys got some, some coin, I guess like a couple of missions. You hadn't had any time to spend yet.
Kaladen Shash 03:02:22 How much coinage? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:02:30 So I'll give you guys think about what you want to do. In the meantime, we can start the next session, the in person one, because Rex, we do have, we're not playing next Tuesday, correct? Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 03:02:41 Uh, yeah, I've got something that night. So if we skip, that's fine. Then we would just play that weekend. That would be like the 17th or the 16th. I don't know if we settled on a date specifically Saturday or Sunday, but
Kaladen Shash 03:02:50 Next weekend or weekend after next? Is that what we're saying? 10 days? Both days. Is that OK, Jesse?
Zariel Torgan 03:02:54 Hmm. That worked.
Dungeon Master 03:03:02 We hadn't because I'm helping trap move. So it just depended on when they need me for that more or less. You guys move in Saturday or Sunday? Primarily. Okay. So if we could play Sunday, that'd be 17.
Ratshit 03:03:13 Likely Saturday, when we have the U-Haul.
Kaladen Shash 03:03:24 All right, cool, so we'll just plan on 18th, is that what that is? 17th, Sunday, okay.
Leopold Magnus 03:03:28 I think it would be the 17th. Yeah, cool. I'll put that on my calendar right now. That'd be, yeah, that'll be awesome. So basically in two weeks is when we'll play. I mean, I'm happy to play other nights too on that week if we want, otherwise we can just postpone too.
Dungeon Master 03:03:43 No, that's cool. If we're playing in person, I want to be able to drop maps and stuff, so I'll need some extra time to do that.
Leopold Magnus 03:04:03 Awesome. I guess also, so it seems reasonable that I could gather the supplies I need for that sword in these days, or is that going to be a bigger thing? Cool. So I just have to wait for two weeks to figure out what it does.
Kaladen Shash 03:04:03 That's great. It'll be good.
Zariel Torgan 03:04:05 Yeah, yeah, works for me.
Dungeon Master 03:04:13 Mm-hmm. No, you can definitely do it. You have the hard part. You got that figured out. Wait two weeks, and then obviously you have to build it. So we'll do some like, you know, sleight of hand, tinkering checks, things like that.
Leopold Magnus 03:04:37 Cool. Well, thanks for joining, Travis. That was a lot of fun. Yeah, of course. Donnie was cracking me up.
Kaladen Shash 03:04:39 All right, great. No, this is going to go.
Ratshit 03:04:47 Thanks for having me. I got the vibe at least a little bit.
Zariel Torgan 03:04:48 Yeah, it was. Yeah, Donnie was great.
Dungeon Master 03:04:51 And now you'll have some time to figure out a character now. I love the commitment to the soft tissue bit. I muted a couple of times because I couldn't stop giggling about him just being like.
Leopold Magnus 03:05:13 It's just like a completely different man. That's great. That was fun.
Ratshit 03:05:13 SV what I know about stuff, I was like, okay, so here's the thing. I don't fucking know. I want to be helpful with my scope. Yeah, I'm sure. Is he more of a gruff kind of guy before? Because I definitely 180'd that.
Zariel Torgan 03:05:19 Yeah, that was pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he was very much, I'm getting too old for this shit.
Kaladen Shash 03:05:36 Bye.
Dungeon Master 03:05:37 He was he was really fed up with them at all times because they're kind of ridiculous. And I love that you're like, no, I'm 26. I have damaged my esophagus. I have brain damage.
Ratshit 03:05:45 Makes sense, he'll probably go back to that. Sure, sure. He'll only be telling jokes about himself. Yeah, I don't know if Ratchet, I don't know if I'll continue to play Ratchet or not. We'll see.
Zariel Torgan 03:05:49 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 03:06:03 That shit just was never the same after the accident. That's great.
Dungeon Master 03:06:08 It'd be really funny if he was still technically Ratchet but it was a completely different character and he took a different class and everything was different beyond the fact that he has the same name and you technically know him. They say concussions change people, you know?
Kaladen Shash 03:06:17 She's cursed. She's cursed.
Ratshit 03:06:22 Yeah, that direct on all the all the previous
Zariel Torgan 03:06:28 Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 03:06:35 So I've heard.

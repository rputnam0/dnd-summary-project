Dungeon Master 00:00:00 It's been a little bit so who would like a more detailed recap or do you guys read the summaries and you're good?
Kaladin Shash 00:00:02 Oh, Craig. Uh, some of these are pretty pretty good with where we're at. I mean, give us a.
Zariel Torgan 00:00:03 Goddamn.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:27 I'm always good. Yeah, if you think there's more more to include, they got left out.
Kaladin Shash 00:00:32 A brief recap.
Zariel Torgan 00:00:35 Yeah, I feel pretty good.
Dungeon Master 00:00:35 Yeah. After, uh, no, it's, it's really thorough. I just didn't know if you guys wanted to hear it. You had your fight with the Reverend. Um, everything hit a pretty intense point, but you had a brief moment to breathe. Um, you each received some mysterious items, Kaladin, a potion called the soul prosthesis. Leopold got a creepy six inch porcelain doll that looked like him. And Zariel got a pocket workshop.
Dungeon Master 00:01:00 You then turned your attention to Cedric, the occultist who had led the attack on the Med Bay. He stole that strange fae mask that Kaladin has pulled toward. Your pursuit led you deeper underground from the Forgotten Chapel, dedicated to Teyo, and as you were moving through these caverns, Kaladin's sharp senses eventually caught the scent of wildfire, a clear sign that Cedric blessed him too far off.
Dungeon Master 00:01:24 He eventually came upon the impromptu leader of the cult and one of his lone followers, as they had made camp at the edge of a large cliff that seemed to go into the abyss. Things took an unfortunate turn when Leopold's armor let out a loud, cacophonous clang after being hit by a stalactite that had fallen from the ceiling, and Zariel let out an audible yelp that only made things worse.
Zariel Torgan 00:01:49 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:01:49 One of the cultists, who was alone, came running. You knew you didn't have too much time, so you guys went immediately into combat. Kaladin, sort of, was the highlight with his new sword light splitter. Zahariel turned into, and this is really important, the now tannin-established form of his finger, standing upright with a bowler hat with his flaming claws.
Kaladin Shash 00:02:07 Yeah, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:02:14 Leopold found some struggle initially, not hitting a whole lot. It was really unfortunate. But after landing a Witch Bolt, eventually he had a lot of steady damage. It came through together with the Magic Stone. You guys took a lot of blows and it was getting really intense. He hit this sort of middle form that transformed him into like this more nature-based monster. But then at the final slash, Zariel bisected Cedric, killing him.
Dungeon Master 00:02:42 You took the mask. He turned to stone. And at this point, Kaladin has not put the mask on his face. But you followed through the tunnels. It said go to the water. Through a whole lot of traversing, time passing, you guys eventually ended up for the first time ever, and this is kind of the interesting part, outside of the dome, and it appeared
Dungeon Master 00:03:09 Beautiful blue skies, no immediate sign of danger. You guys didn't really know where you were at first, but as you took in this new world, some questions were formed with Zario, who suggested maybe the dome's dangers may have been exaggerated to keep people under control. You walked in what you assumed to be the correct
Dungeon Master 00:03:29 direction when eventually Leopold spotted the dome. You also discovered Leopold had sort of strayed a little bit and found this sort of boggy area, a large monstrous amphibian frog like creature the size of a tiny house, seemingly like hunting a giant beetle. And we left it sort of right there. You guys haven't engaged. You don't know if you've been noticed. So you don't necessarily you're not going to roll initiative right away.
Dungeon Master 00:03:59 But that's sort of setting the scene as you sort of walk up. It's midday at this point. The sun is just past its apex, sort of coming down in the sky. Leopold is slightly ahead of the group, and you're just sort of watching this enormous monster go after these, like, giant insects.
Zariel Torgan 00:04:26 Hmm. I missed it. In this, did we, we leveled up, right? We did? Yeah. Oh, okay. Just making sure. I mean, I thought, you know, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:04:31 Yeah. Sure. Level up again from five to six. Are you? No, you just level up again. Of course you guys all agree.
Kaladin Shash 00:04:44 Oh, oh, OK, OK, but. Just check it. Are. Let's go. Well, that's it.
Leopold Magnus 00:04:50 I kind of thought, you know, I agree with you. I guess, I guess. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:04:59 That's funny. One of these times, Rex, you should go back and change the transcript to it's like, yeah, you said. You said we're going to level up. Good question.
Dungeon Master 00:05:00 I'm not going to level you up two sessions in a row. That would be really funny. Late, it's like past midday. The sun, like I said, has hit its apex and it's sort of starting on the path to setting.
Kaladin Shash 00:05:14 What time of day is it? All right, and we've only just started making our way to where we felt like the conflict was occurring whenever we opened the dome.
Dungeon Master 00:05:33 No, you've been walking for a while, so you had spotted the dome and then kept walking. You guys had a couple encounter checks before eventually rolling like a nat one or something. I forget what it was. But like eventually you came upon this on your way back to the dome.
Kaladin Shash 00:05:52 All right.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:53 I'm seeing that I haven't used any spells or wild shapes. Does that sound right? OK. OK. Cool. Do we recognize this creature as anything we would have any information on? Like something?
Dungeon Master 00:06:02 Yeah, it's been mostly just walking today. You can give me a nature check or like history check.
Zariel Torgan 00:06:25 My nature is not good, but I'll give it a shot.
Dungeon Master 00:06:33 I think they're different stats. Six. No. You can tell this does look like a frog to some extent. No. Like that.
Leopold Magnus 00:06:48 Does it look like that? Oh, I like, I like it. That's sick. Oh, he's like a really juicy.
Kaladin Shash 00:06:57 Beatles up guy you do an image generator. I love them. Hey, Jonathan, did you did you post music for tonight? Small house we could all get on there
Zariel Torgan 00:07:01 Oh, that's so funny. Yeah. Oh, yeah, sorry. I keep. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:07:05 Yeah, should be in the chat above Jesse's photos. Yeah, it's enormous. You could all be on space.
Leopold Magnus 00:07:15 Would it be obvious? Could you ride one of these? Yeah, I'll perk up to the group and I'll say like, um, gents, fancy a ride back to the dome? And point over at the large amphibian.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:42 I think that might be ill-advised. Perhaps we should see what we're capable of with this beetle and see how dangerous it is. Maybe we should hide. Yeah, I'll slip behind a tree.
Kaladin Shash 00:07:47 I agree with Zorio.
Leopold Magnus 00:07:56 Oh, oh, okay, yes, well, if you insist, maybe we should take cover.
Dungeon Master 00:08:07 Getting me a group self-check then. I don't know. Not bad at all. Good average though. I mean, maybe it notices you guys, right?
Zariel Torgan 00:08:11 I got a 13. Is this what I think it is, Jonathan? It's fair. Not bad at all.
Kaladin Shash 00:08:23 I can't read your mind.
Leopold Magnus 00:08:23 Uh, 15. How bad would this be managed?
Dungeon Master 00:08:42 Oh, it's got great perception. Yeah, didn't realize it. Yeah, it had a plus nine, didn't expect that. You guys are, Zahra, you'll start to back up, and Kaladin follows, both very quiet.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:53 Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:08:54 It's yours.
Dungeon Master 00:09:05 Leopold being the one who was sort of ahead and had noticed it and was the farthest up and being sort of stuck in this idea of like let's ride this he takes a clumsy step back just splashes very loudly in the water and like the sort of boggy murky water just large sucking mud sound as it happens and this huge creature like
Dungeon Master 00:09:29 at this point has like let out it's about to shoot its tongue like its mouth parts a little bit and you see like jagged teeth sticking out and large points and then this tongue that has like coated in lightning is the best way to put it shoots out of its mouth sort of sticks this beetle shocking it and then it pulls it back in
Dungeon Master 00:09:53 swallowing it and you see like a large, deep croak shakes the water around you. And then one of its eyes sort of flips backwards, training right on Leopold. And it sort of does the frog turn thing where every, every limb moves a little bit at a time. So it just sort of scoots itself backwards into a stance at you. And sort of like left, right, left front arm sort of set it, tilt its head and it just sort of watches you for a moment.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:15 Yes, yes, I see.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:27 Easy there, boy! Is there any beetles around me?
Dungeon Master 00:10:36 Now the beetle that I had like gone after to eat was like three feet in length, like a large insectoid creature. You don't see anything that big in this immediate area. So you call out to it?
Leopold Magnus 00:10:56 I tell you what, uh, yeah, so I'm going to, I'm going to take the, uh, all or nothing coin out of my bag. Uh, I guess I'll just kind of reach in to my chest cavity and pull it out and I'll just flip it up in the air. And as it's spinning, I'm going to go try and ride this thing. And I think by the time it lands, we'll find out if I can get on it.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:03 Oh shit. It's now your mouth.
Dungeon Master 00:11:21 Okay, this check will be to determine if you get on it, but it's not me telling you that you can ride this monster on a coin flip.
Leopold Magnus 00:11:30 Yeah, that's fine. OK.
Dungeon Master 00:11:31 But I want to see how this plays out. I will let you with that get all the way to it, though. However long the movement is, you can fully close the distance as you like flip the coin up and you just like rings really loudly. And the frog monster sort of cracks it through the air as you're sprinting across the ground. You see, even though he had been the one to make the noise by stepping deep into the mud at first, he is lying over this.
Kaladin Shash 00:11:31 Control.
Dungeon Master 00:12:00 Call it, you know. However you want to define it, it just has to be defined to start with. 1 through 20, 11, I mean 1 through 10, 11 through 20.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:02 So I'm going to roll a d20, and then what is that? Higher would be heads, lower would be tails. OK, so if it's a heads, it's treated as a 20, tails is treated as a 1. So greater than 10 will be heads, and then lower would be tails. How's that sound? Yes. Oh, boy.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:28 Mm-hmm. I can't see it. Oh. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:31 Ooh, baby. How about that? 11. An 11. So that would be heads, right? Tail. Greater than 10 was heads. So I think you said 1 through 10 would be tails, and 11 through 20 would be heads, right?
Kaladin Shash 00:12:38 What's that number? Yeah. OK. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:12:40 I'm waiting for it. It hasn't come through. Didn't you say one through 10 with 10? Okay. Okay. You bounding across.
Dungeon Master 00:13:06 jump up and leap on one of its sort of haunches of its bent leg, and then tumble onto its back, sort of laying onto your belly, getting up sort of unsteadily as your knees as it immediately notices and turns a little bit like we'll say like 40 degrees to its right, just sort of spinning as you are now on top of it.
Leopold Magnus 00:13:29 Oh, easy there. Easy there, fella. Easy there, boy. I'm going to try and hold on. And OK, perfect.
Kaladin Shash 00:13:36 I'm going to hold an action. And just see if he. Yeah, I think I'm I'm just going to wait and watch what happens if he gets tossed or if he gets aggressive all. Cast.
Dungeon Master 00:13:37 Oh, you're on it. That'll be like your action for this round. What do you guys want to do? We're not in initiative yet. So if you want to hold your first thing in an initiative, we will.
Dungeon Master 00:14:06 And Zario, anything out of you? I mean, you could do intelligence. You could do wisdom. You could do animal handling. You could do nature. You could do insight. You can make a lot of checks to determine if something's going to be really, really violent.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:10 Uh, what kind of check would it be to get like a vibe from how violent this creature is? It would be like animal handling. So like, since it's like demeaning. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:37 I want to, I'll just throw a real insight. I just want to see if this thing is clearly going to like, just like turn and try to kill Leopold the 21. Okay. All right. Was that my action or do I,
Dungeon Master 00:14:50 21. Yeah, this is a violent predator. You can tell by like, no, I mean, that's just a pretty easy check. You see looking at it like it's got sharp pointed teeth. It's got like a thick eye full of scars. And when you stumbled upon it, it used like a lightning tongue on this beetle.
Dungeon Master 00:15:18 almost just like instantly taking it in despite the size, like this thing looks very dangerous. And the first thing it did when Leopold jumped on its back was sort of turn instinctively. So it's it's aware of what has happened, but it hasn't like knocked him off yet.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:19 All right. I'm going to go into my bear form.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:49 But before I do, I'm going to cast Flame Blade. Actually, I think, I don't think that statistically the odds were any better or the damage was any better. So we'll say they're on fire for flavor, but I'll save the spell slot and I'll run over. So I'll burn one of my wild shapes and head over.
Dungeon Master 00:16:18 OK. OK, we'll have a let.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:20 And then let's see what I got. Yeah, I'll just action a movement just to get up in its space. Yeah. And that's all I got. Just going to posture. Looks scary.
Dungeon Master 00:16:45 Kaladin, do something now if you would like, is like the last thing in initiative. But everybody go ahead and roll initiative, and we're sort of running right into this. But you can attack if that's what you would have wanted to have done.
Kaladin Shash 00:16:58 Um. Yeah, I would have. I would have attacked, but since. Leopold is still on top, I'm just gonna. I'll just enter initiative. Yeah, I just want OK. All I'll do fireball that. I don't believe that hits as an 11 hit.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:14 Yeah, you should attack this thing if that's what you're thinking.
Kaladin Shash 00:17:29 Big. Yeah, fair enough. Zips off to the side. I'll also just take the opportunity then to move about 20 feet.
Dungeon Master 00:17:31 11 does not hit. All right.
Dungeon Master 00:17:56 Reset combat. Okay, up first is going to be Sauriel. You have ran up to this. And we'll say just like as a continuation of your turn, you shifted into the bear. You're on all fours. Well, you're on all twos. You're sprinting at it. And now you get to do something.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:16 All right. So I'm going to make my attacks on it. Is there, do I get advantage because of where Leo is or no? Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:18:39 He's not technically flanking with how big it is. 22 hits. 12 misses.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:46 No problem. All right. Then I am going to make two attacks in my bear form. First is going to be a bite attack. That's going to be 22. And the next is going to be my claw attack. That's going to be 12. OK. So for the bite damage, we're going to be looking at 9 piercing damage.
Dungeon Master 00:19:17 Line piercing. Did you use that one app?
Zariel Torgan 00:19:18 And it looks a lot like this. Anyway. I did, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:19:30 What? Oh my God. Yeah. That is so crazy. Is that is that the app? This is this is the app rec suggestion. This is gonna get crazy. Oh yeah, OK.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:31 That's fucking incredible just tongue in that toad Yeah, that's great
Zariel Torgan 00:19:48 I love that thing so much. Oh, shit. All right, that's all I got.
Dungeon Master 00:19:49 This is going to get ridiculous. OK, Caledon, you're up next. Go for it.
Kaladin Shash 00:20:01 Oh my gosh. I'm going to go ahead and. I'm going to throw another firebolt. For another 11 absolutely misses and then I'm going to start closing the distance. I'm gonna start running. So I get within.
Kaladin Shash 00:20:27 I just need to get within space next round. I'll start, I'll move up to here.
Dungeon Master 00:20:33 All righty. Leopold, your turn. You start your turn. You are not prone. It's not difficult terrain. You are sort of standing on the back of this thing.
Leopold Magnus 00:20:46 Okay. Oh, oh dear. I think I may have made a grave mistake. This is a rather rowdy toad. And I will cast Burning Hands at the second level, just cook the back of this sucker.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:03 Damn! Yeah
Kaladin Shash 00:21:12 Yes. That's a great hit, man.
Dungeon Master 00:21:13 Is that a deck save? You unleash this torrent of flame onto the back of this monster. It's got nowhere to go because you're so close to it.
Leopold Magnus 00:21:15 of 16. Yeah. Pretty big, pretty big hit unless he passes. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:21:41 You notice that it doesn't seem to do as much as you'd like. Yeah, you're all very close. Well, actually, I don't know. That's a hard one to tell.
Kaladin Shash 00:21:46 Mm.
Leopold Magnus 00:21:47 Interesting.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:48 Hmm. Fire damage, huh? Interesting. Did we notice that, or? OK. Interesting. Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:22:08 Leopold can tell his spell wasn't as effective as he was casting it, but I'll leave it up to you if you think that you could notice the spell not being as effective. It doesn't seem to take a huge recoil. It didn't roll onto its back to cast a flame.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:21 I guess I haven't seen him use this spell that much.
Leopold Magnus 00:22:32 With my bonus action, I'm going to cast Magic Stone. And that will be my action and bonus action.
Dungeon Master 00:22:48 All righty, up next is this creature's turn. It's going to sort of spin and it sees this huge bear in front and it's got Leopold on its back. Leopold has been the most dangerous, so it'll do two things. Well, three things. It can do two attacks and also this other thing.
Dungeon Master 00:23:16 You see it opens its mouth and you see like the lightning charges from inside sort of shock back and forth and deep in the throat and then it lets out two attacks. One will be right at Zario in front but then you see the tongue whips around the back to the top to hit Leopold.
Leopold Magnus 00:23:39 Now, could I use a reaction here?
Dungeon Master 00:23:42 If you have a reaction to use, the first one on Zariel is a 15. Then, 15 to hit Leopold, which obviously doesn't. Zariel, you take... 25 damage. Wow. Yeah, that's a big hit.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:48 Yeah. That hits. Damn. Damn.
Kaladin Shash 00:24:07 Watch it man, that was a stiff hit, that was a stiff hit.
Dungeon Master 00:24:15 And you are grappled as the tongue, as it hits you, you stick to it, stunned from the shocks. The tongue comes back to the front where you're standing, so you're not going to move you on the map. But you are considered grappled until your turn.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:27 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:24:33 And then it doesn't have, since it's got you in its mouth, it can't do a bite. So it'll turn its side and then count and give me a dexterity saving throw. As you see one of its legs comes flying at you as it kicks backwards.
Kaladin Shash 00:24:57 Well. Alright, so prone in 10 feet back damn.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:59 Mm.
Dungeon Master 00:25:02 Well, it does not pass. You take not a lot of damage on this one. It's not about the damage. You take one point of bludgeoning damage, but you were kicked back ten feet and are knocked prone. Here. And that is up at the top, Zariel.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:31 Are my attacks with disadvantage or I just can't like run away All right, then I'm gonna take a bite and then a swipe again, so that's gonna be a 25 on the bite And a 15 on the claws Oh, yeah Oh ouch six on the bite
Dungeon Master 00:25:37 Uh, you just can't run away. Attacks on other creatures would have disadvantage. Hits. It's been hit. Nice.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:01 And oof, nine on the claws for a total of 15. Arr. And then, I mean, that's it. Yeah, that's all I got.
Dungeon Master 00:26:10 six and nine. You can try to escape if you'd like. Otherwise you can just stay. I don't think so. I wouldn't call it that.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:32 Doesn't that take an action? Okay, is it opposed strength? Okay, my strength's decent as a bear. 12? Oh-ho! I, uh...
Dungeon Master 00:26:40 Yeah. It rolled nine. You break out.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:01 indignantly adjust adjust my hat and just bear press back and do a kung fu bear stance cool
Leopold Magnus 00:27:09 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:27:15 Very nice. 15 damage, broke the grapple, not bad. Up next, Kaladin. Knocked back, winged out of your chest a little bit because that was a strong pick, but nothing else seems to be wrong at this point.
Kaladin Shash 00:27:31 Uh, use a stand up half on movement. I'm going to run 10 feet forward. And then I'll Misty step. To the backside, so I have advantage. So we could hit 25 to hit.
Dungeon Master 00:27:50 Oh, nice. 25 hits.
Kaladin Shash 00:28:08 It's not a kind of a soft rule there. And we'll call the, what was the base rule? Well, the six narc necrotic damage.
Dungeon Master 00:28:25 Nice. Seems to take effect as, like, the light is sapped from the area. You hit, like, almost into a dark void. It disappears. You feel like it takes full damage. Doesn't seem to take any extra or anything like that, though.
Kaladin Shash 00:28:44 Okay, cool. What are you doing?
Zariel Torgan 00:28:53 yeah we get it we get it just walked away he's like i want to rat it
Leopold Magnus 00:28:53 Well, well, I thought we'd have the ride, but. This thing is quite rowdy. Yeah, all right, so with that. I'm going to use my. We got this under control, I'm going to use my action to do cantrip, I'm going to do Ray of Frost.
Dungeon Master 00:28:55 It's Leopold's turn.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:25 20 to hit. Okay. I'll take 10 frost damage. And then my bonus action. Is his tongue kind of swirling around, floating away? Like, I mean, I guess what's the range? Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:29:28 Not at the moment.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:55 I'm just wondering, I'd probably take a penalty, right? Being so close. If I'm shooting a stone at him. I mean, is his hind quarters 10 feet away though? I mean, he's a pretty big creature, right? Ah.
Dungeon Master 00:30:04 Yeah, if it's a range attack, regardless, within 10 feet. Yeah, but it's not about his size, it's about your distance to him. Your space is within 10 feet.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:26 I see, okay. So what would it be then? Or can I just not make that attempt? Okay. I'll try and do magic stone here. And a hit. Okay. Yep, so that's my action.
Kaladin Shash 00:30:26 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:30:33 You can't, it'd just be a disadvantage. Can miss it, unfortunately. Just too rocky as you're on top of his back. He's moving around a lot at this point, so it's a wonder you're even on there. But yeah, that is action, bonus action. Would you like to use movement?
Leopold Magnus 00:30:59 No, I'll just I'll just kind of try and get prone and hang on.
Dungeon Master 00:31:10 Nice, okay. I like that you intentionally got prone. I'll give you advantage on any check. It is this creature's turn. It's got a lot of options. It'll take two Atung attacks and an additional bite attack.
Dungeon Master 00:31:39 No, sorry, it won't bite, it'll kick. Same thing as last time. First one on Zariel right in front. 27 to hit. Yeah. 13 damage. And then Leopold hit you.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:53 Just barely.
Dungeon Master 00:32:12 18. And then it'll kick out in 12. It's a big old miss. OK, that is its turn.
Leopold Magnus 00:32:14 18 misses.
Kaladin Shash 00:32:34 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:32:38 Uh, it's surrounded. It can't really jump away. It you don't like You don't have a lot of intelligence out of this creature. Uh, so you just see like it's just fighting back at this point Sorry
Zariel Torgan 00:32:55 Hmm. Well, I'm still a bear. And as a bear, I'm going to bite and claw. 21 for the bite. And 22 for the claw. Yeah, just munching away on that bear. That's better to start. 12 for the bite. And 14 for the claw.
Dungeon Master 00:33:10 Both hit. 14 exactly hits. Oh, well, then I also just told you. OK, well, 26 damage.
Kaladin Shash 00:33:29 Those are damaged. From 14. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:29 What? No, I... That's my damages. I got... Okay. Yeah. Yes. I just... I'm munching away. I'm going for those frog legs. I have a very refined palate.
Dungeon Master 00:33:41 You're just getting like, you know, a portion of part of its leg, like it's not encompassing the whole thing. It's pretty big. But those are some nasty hit. Update as hell. Bam, bam, bam. Kaladin, it's your turn.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:59 I feel like I'm doing a really good job.
Kaladin Shash 00:34:12 Uh, I will do the same thing. I'll go ahead and take another. Attack with. Is it light splitter? Something with this word right now? Neither of those hit again. That is awesome.
Dungeon Master 00:34:23 That is the name of the sword, yes. Two fours. That is tough. You're swinging at this monster, but like from where you're at, it's just not finding good purchase. You can't, there's not like a,
Zariel Torgan 00:34:38 Oof, ouch. Would he get advantage? Oh, bummer. Okay, sorry.
Kaladin Shash 00:34:41 Some swing out of barn and I couldn't hit it. I wrote I was with advantage, yeah. That's OK. We were there.
Dungeon Master 00:34:52 an easily sliceable portion of meat. It's really thick in this spot and you can't get a good angle. That was with advantage. He rolled a 4 and a 4. Yeah. He multiclassed. He doesn't have two attacks, you know. Not yet. But go ahead, while you're back there and you're sort of whiffing on this monster, let me have Perception check.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:10 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:35:26 14. That's OK. That's not super high, but not super low. As you're slicing into this creature, you notice that it's got some tattered cloth strewn on its back, on one of the hip, one of its legs in that crease.
Kaladin Shash 00:35:28 14.
Dungeon Master 00:35:51 draped around part of the back seems to be stuck on some like mud and some growth and like the skin is like folded over it trapped it in place um but a 14 isn't enough to like know what it is after your turn leopold
Kaladin Shash 00:36:02 OK.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:04 This frog had pants.
Leopold Magnus 00:36:11 Yeah, let me see. Is that ranged? Which bolt isn't a ranged attack, is it? It is a ranged attack.
Kaladin Shash 00:36:34 Yes. I think. I want to say yes, you use it up to 30 feet.
Leopold Magnus 00:36:45 Well like once you connect though, like is that a ranged attack? Oh, but he, nevermind. This guy is like glowing with lightning. He probably wouldn't, probably wouldn't have. Okay, so then for my action, I will unfold my Steel Defender. So kind of half of my armor will whirl up and spin and emerging from my enormous suit is a smaller,
Dungeon Master 00:36:50 Now, once it's connected, it's there.
Leopold Magnus 00:37:14 standing suit of armor. And I will command him to attack. And then for my bonus action, I will try another magic stone. Damn, 13 to hit. Okay, so then that's my, that's my action and bonus action.
Kaladin Shash 00:37:27 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:37:32 13 misses. And then your steel defender goes. I'm pulling it up right now that I'm working on.
Zariel Torgan 00:37:34 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:37:44 Yeah, so I'll just have him run down the side, maybe dropping over here. I don't have a token for him. OK, awesome. And I will make him just simply attack with his Force Empowered Rend.
Kaladin Shash 00:37:58 Hello.
Leopold Magnus 00:38:15 That's a 1d8 plus proficiency bonus. And no, I can never figure out what my proficiency bonus. Oh, 3. OK. So 1d8 plus 3 here. Force damage.
Dungeon Master 00:38:23 Does he rule the hair?
Kaladin Shash 00:38:32 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 00:38:47 5 damage from the defender. Yeah, I guess he needs to roll to hit. Would he have flanking in this position? I'll maybe slide him a little closer to Kaladin so he can get flanking.
Dungeon Master 00:39:03 You could put him in a position to flank if you'd like. Because you're technically on top, so he could get it. There, natural 20. Okay, so you're 5 damage.
Leopold Magnus 00:39:16 with the bear. And I'll roll one more and see if that hits. Ah, natural 20. It does 10.
Dungeon Master 00:39:34 becomes 10, yeah. Big difference, quite literally double. Up next is this creature. Got four options. Everybody roll me a d20. Lowest number doesn't get attacked.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:36 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 00:40:13 Nice, sorry, I'll nail the two on that one.
Dungeon Master 00:40:17 on a d4. Yeah, and also the still defender just gets, just takes one of the attacks. Okay, first up, we'll just do in order again, so it'll be Zario, Leopold, and then still defender. 26 to hit Zario.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:18 I rolled, yeah, it's Kaladin. Oh, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:40:47 12 to hit Leopold. And 19 to hit the Steel Defender. Alrighty, Zarios damage first. You take 24 damage.
Leopold Magnus 00:40:49 That misses. Steel Defender has an AC. 15, yeah, that hits.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:14 Oh. I. That's what you meant that for Zario, right? I no longer a bear.
Kaladin Shash 00:41:15 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:41:19 And then Steel Defender takes... Oh, sorry, he doesn't take the bite damage. That's not him. He just takes a d6 and gets kicked a distance away. Yeah, no. The Steel Defender takes 5 points... Steel Defender takes 5 damage and gets pushed 10 feet into the, like, tree line.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:47 OK.
Dungeon Master 00:41:49 And then the bear in front, pulling cap first, disintegrates back into the true form of Zariel. I'm sure we'll see that bear really soon. But that's all it can do on its turn. Real straightforward. Zariel, your turn. You've just been
Zariel Torgan 00:42:00 That hurt. I'm going to take a wild swing here.
Dungeon Master 00:42:19 You've been like fucking whacked three times.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:27 And I'm going to reach up, since I'm a person now, and put my hand to the skies. You'll see a swirling black cloud appear roughly 60 feet in the air above this toad. And I'm going to try to call down lightning on this thing, hoping that the water and the murky will maybe hurt it. It's going to be a dex save. 15.
Dungeon Master 00:43:00 This is really interesting. This is obviously based off of, if you haven't figured it out, a frog he-myth.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:02 Alright, it's gonna take 3d10 lightning damage and that's gonna be 16 lightning damage and the spell maintains the storm cloud just swirling up above.
Leopold Magnus 00:43:06 Stay at home.
Dungeon Master 00:43:29 It has resistance to lightning damage, but it also has shock susceptibility. If it takes lightning damage, it suffers several effects until the end of its next turn. Its speed is halved. It takes a minus 2 to AC, and deck saves. And it can't use reactions or multi-tack on a turn. It can only use either an action or bonus action, not both.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:37 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:43:56 So you do 8 damage, but you see as the lightning connects with it in this environment, it like almost gets overcharged and it like can't focus and its limbs are shaking and it can't like, it just can't like coordinate its movements as it's really struggling to get its bearings. Call lightning is not AoE, right?
Zariel Torgan 00:44:23 Let me check. I don't think so. Sorry, one second. It says each creature within five feet. So it's big enough to where I could have chose to shoot it to where it's not going to hit Leo. Oh, shit.
Dungeon Master 00:44:34 It's like a target. I was just thinking you very specifically mentioned the water, and I might make it try to shock Kaladin if. But if you just wanted to hit it and maybe not the water, it'd still have the same effect.
Zariel Torgan 00:44:54 Hmm. Uh, yeah, yeah. I'll just have it hit, like, over here if I can, just on, like, his, like, leg or something. I mean, just looks.
Dungeon Master 00:45:04 You mean you don't want to intentionally stun your friend? Alrighty, good turn and it just stays right. Call lightning is just there.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:20 Yeah, it's just up. And then bonus action... I'll Healing Word my... No, I'll take one of those potion things on our chest. Oh, do those work still? Might save it then. I'll just cast Healing Word on myself.
Dungeon Master 00:45:36 The ones built into your suits do not work outside of the dome, but you have some other ones that you'd picked up. All righty. Two. Okay, Kaladin, you're up.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:51 Oof, ouch. All right. This is tough, dude. You're making good plays. It's just the dice are just so bad.
Kaladin Shash 00:46:00 I do the same thing. I. Don't hit her on the 23. Oh my gosh, has been the worst round today. Yeah. Sorry.
Leopold Magnus 00:46:19 That is really hard. Five minute, five minute break, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:46:22 Maybe he's taking his stuff away from the computer, check it out, come back a new man. Maybe he just needs to be lighter. No.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:29 Turn it off, turn it back on. What? There you go, okay.
Kaladin Shash 00:46:34 Um, I think, I think what, cause it can't take a reaction right now. I'm going to use 30 feet of movement.
Dungeon Master 00:46:51 It's going to use 30 feet of movement. OK. Leopold, you are up, followed by your steel defender.
Kaladin Shash 00:47:04 Silence.
Leopold Magnus 00:47:05 Um, yeah, so with my action, I will do another stuff. My bonus action is pretty limited unless I use stone. So I guess I might as well keep trying that. But for my action, I will do a
Leopold Magnus 00:47:39 Ray of Frost cantrip. Roll the hit for that. Oh, 26 to hit. Oh, 12 damage. And then with my third and last magic stone, I will attempt to hit it.
Dungeon Master 00:47:47 26 hits. 12 damage, nice. 13. It has a minus 2 to its AC, so its AC is currently 12.
Kaladin Shash 00:47:47 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:09 Yeah, not hitting. 13 on that one. Oh, shit. That was actually super cool. So it connects and takes another nine points of damage. And then it was only 10 feet, my still defender got pushback.
Zariel Torgan 00:48:13 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 00:48:25 Another line damage.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:36 OK, yeah, so you'll kind of see its head rotate. Imagine it got pushed back and fell. So it's like arms and legs all kind of flip around and stand upright. And then it kind of very clunkily charges the toad. And with a very discontinuous slashing motion, does a force-empowered rend.
Leopold Magnus 00:49:05 And that is, I guess I'll just, 18 to hit. I don't know if this guy has a plus to his, like attack. Really tough to, let's see.
Dungeon Master 00:49:19 18 hit It would say Does it give you a character sheet for him So you find them on your normal page, right
Kaladin Shash 00:49:26 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 00:49:31 Yeah, but it's kind of hard to see because it only pops up in the width of the game chat Well, I don't know how to like get a better Yeah features and traits and I click steal defender and then that pops up but like is it an extra Can I add it as an extra oh yeah battles battlesmith defender
Dungeon Master 00:49:52 I mean, like, if you open up your character sheet on a different tab or something like that, I was thinking. But anyway.
Leopold Magnus 00:50:05 Oh, I see. Like in D&D Beyond. All right. I mean, it doesn't matter in this case, because I definitely connected. But yeah, I guess he'll make a connection. And then that will be a force and power of Rend, which is a 1d8 plus my proficiency bonus, which is 3.
Zariel Torgan 00:50:07 Yeah, it's your spell attack modifier is what you use to hit. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:50:33 Let's go. Nice good damage. It's looking pretty hurt. Is not as healthy as when you guys walk in for sure. A good round at a Leopold and a steel defender up next is this creature.
Leopold Magnus 00:50:36 Nice, 10 damage on that swing.
Dungeon Master 00:51:03 It's not looking great. It can't hit Leopold. Been a problem on its back. Still Defender behind it. It is going to take a reliable tongue attack on Zariel. And it will... It is then going to take a leap towards Kaladin. Leopold, are you still prone? Did you ever get up?
Leopold Magnus 00:51:34 I don't think so. I mean, I attacked him, but I don't, should have, I, uh, hated a penalty for being prone. Okay. Oh, that was tough. That was an 18 and it cracked over to it too.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:34 Oh, it hit me?
Dungeon Master 00:51:42 No, you won't get a penalty for being prone. Go ahead and give me like an athletics check to hold on as it jumps. 18 to hit thorough. Yeah. It is huge.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:05 Ah, shit, yeah. Oh, wait, is this a huge or bigger creature? Hang on, let me check my ring of the giant slayer. Oh, I only get a plus one. Oh, no, it's a plus two against creatures of the giant type. Oh, damn it. Okay, yeah, it still hits.
Dungeon Master 00:52:19 Still hit. It's not a giant though. Okay, 16 points of damage. Leopold, you do not hang on, so you're going to take only 1d6 falling damage, but you are going to land prone.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:36 Tch.
Dungeon Master 00:52:49 You take one point of falling damage. Mixed with murky muddy water. It'll jump out of your guys's space to take like.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:53 You see a whole bunch of dust and coins and other trinkets kind of fly out of Leopold's chest cavity when he lands.
Dungeon Master 00:53:09 a huge attack on Kaladin, but you all, except Leopold because he's being knocked off in this process, Zariel and the Steel Defender can take an attack of opportunity if they like. I believe it only lets you cast a spell with a range of touch.
Kaladin Shash 00:53:17 We.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:22 I have War Caster. Does that mean I can pump another lightning into him?
Dungeon Master 00:53:38 You are welcome to check out for sure. 16 would hit. Oh, you know what? They couldn't do any of this. It's it's lightning stunned. What am I doing? It would have. You guys wouldn't have made the attack on it, but labeled you'd still be on top.
Leopold Magnus 00:53:38 Uh, 16 to hit with a steel defender. Or damage.
Kaladin Shash 00:53:56 Oh, that's great.
Dungeon Master 00:54:06 And it would have only have taken the one attack on Zarya because it can't do anything else. My bad, I almost forgot that. But up at the top then, you see this effect seems to sort of subside after it has a chance to move around. So at the end of its turn, the effect ends. But back up at the top of the initiative is Zarya. Is that all of that?
Zariel Torgan 00:54:29 All right, I did roll to maintain concentration, and I was able to maintain. All right. Let's see what this is here. And then I'm just checking to see if it's a bonus action to re-pump it in there every time, or if it's an action. I think it's an action. Yeah, I think so. Okay. All right, yeah, I'll use another action, another deck save.
Dungeon Master 00:54:50 I think it's an Action. You know it's good if deck saves. Eight. Ten. But same deal, you basically stun it.
Kaladin Shash 00:54:52 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:59 even if it's not doing great. It's gonna take 20 halved. I don't have any good bonus actions.
Zariel Torgan 00:55:29 Um, yeah. I guess I'll just, uh... I'll just chill. Um, actually, I'm feeling pretty hurt, and... I'm rec- Was I able to recognize that... It's... Hmm. That it's combat efficiency has been diminished to the point where I feel like I could walk away without taking an attack? Or is that too much? Okay, then I wanna go ahead and move back... Uh...
Dungeon Master 00:55:52 You talked out and do it, but I'd say that's I'd say that's fair. Is that? Return calendar is your turn. Can you?
Zariel Torgan 00:56:00 Like 30 feet, just my regular movement right there. All right, that's all I got.
Kaladin Shash 00:56:13 I'm going to cast... I'm going to use... Ring of the Grimmerian. Ring of the Grimmerian ability. And instead of casting a Firebolt, I'm going to cast an Irebolt and try to deal psychic damage. It won't hit. Man, I'm rolling poop over here on four. I just can't get a vote.
Dungeon Master 00:56:23 OK. Well, nice. Here's what I will. We're not doing firebolt. How about it makes? An intelligence saver take damage. It is a minus 4 to.
Zariel Torgan 00:56:33 Interesting. Oh. Nice. Oh.
Kaladin Shash 00:56:48 There you go, I'm done on time. Yep, still works. Yep, that's OK, it was meant to happen. I'm just doing nothing over here. I will always.
Leopold Magnus 00:56:53 Ooh, you're dumb dumb. Oh, but he's, he's lucky.
Dungeon Master 00:56:54 He got a natural 20. I wish I I'm trying to send it to the chat, but it's not letting me get a natural 20 minus four, but it's still a natural to me. Just hanging out. OK.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:07 Oh, no.
Kaladin Shash 00:57:19 I'm going to use movement. I'm just going to move another 11 feet. That's my turn.
Dungeon Master 00:57:28 30. Okay, Leopold, your turn.
Leopold Magnus 00:57:39 Oh dear, this would have been so much easier if you just let me ride you! And I think with that, I will try to just land another blow. This cantrip ray of frost is doing me good, so I'm going to try again. About time. Natural one on the frost.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:51 Mm.
Dungeon Master 00:58:01 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:58:07 With my bonus action, I will cast Magic Stone to bring it up again. And I'll keep hanging on tight. And then for my Steel Defender, he will attack. Plus 8 is the modifier here.
Kaladin Shash 00:58:23 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:58:36 also a natural one. So I think a nine would miss. Perfect.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:39 Oh. Around. Yes. Absolutely.
Dungeon Master 00:58:39 You Ray of Frost your still defender in the face on accident and it swings wide because of it. It is the creature. With your movement, Kaladin, that last 11 feet, you are out of its range.
Kaladin Shash 00:59:02 Please go up. Yeah. We're on it. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:59:08 Which means it is going to jump at Zariel instead, who is exactly 30 feet away. You're trying to hold on. Unless you let go willingly to attack, but your Steel Defender could do that, yeah. But I need an Athletics check from you, Leopold. Attack of Opportunity from the Steel Defender.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:18 So that would be an attack of opportunity, yeah. No, no, the steel, yeah. Okay. A nine on my athletics check.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:19 Get him steel defender. Alright.
Dungeon Master 00:59:38 And Zariel, give me a Dexterity saving throw as it jumps in the air at you. It builds you to fall off the floor with a 9. Good. Okay, top lane. Hits.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:49 17 on the deck save. Finish him.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:54 The defender also, he landed a 27. Ooh, six, he takes nine damage from that hit.
Dungeon Master 01:00:12 No, not yet. But as it was stunned, and they can't do anything more than this leap, and sort of like you see, as it jumps in the air, halfway through its jump, it sort of spins around so that its legs are kicking you. And like right before it makes impact, it ejects its legs out to try to kick you and you mostly dodge, you still go underneath with like the weight of it and the water splashes and it sort of knocks you down. So you'll take half the damage on
Dungeon Master 01:00:42 It's got a 3d10 plus 6. Yeah, you took 1d6 falling damage.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:52 Now, did that single point of damage come last time when I was supposed to be kicked off? Okay, so that shouldn't have happened, I guess. Or did that happen again? Okay, I got it.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:58 Oof. Oh, OK, good. OK. Let me roll in other cons today. All right, so it's back up to me.
Dungeon Master 01:01:08 We'll just say it continues through. I won't reroll the d6, but you'll take the 1 point. Sorry, you take 10 damage. You take half of that. And since it's stunned, it can't bite you afterwards, so that is its turn. Yes. This creature's looking hurt.
Zariel Torgan 01:01:31 All right, the storm cloud has... All right, yeah, the cloud's got a 60-foot radius, so I'm gonna use my action again to call lightning. It's gonna need to make another deck save. Yeah, it's only 10 feet tall, but it's 60 feet wide, which is a weird thing for them to, like... 17?!
Dungeon Master 01:01:46 Did not realize your radius was that big. 17 on the deck save. Yes. Three, but the effect still happens.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:02 Damn, he's going to take a quarter damage. Alright, so... like, three. Let's see. I'm going to Healing Word myself again. Because I am looking rough. Let's see.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:33 Okay. And then I'm going to move... am I trapped? I got to get away from this guy. You know what? I'm not. I'm going to stand firm because I have faith in my party. Say, y'all get him boys.
Dungeon Master 01:02:41 No, that was a lot of flavor. You passed your state, so you weren't knocked down or anything. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:02 And I'm just going to look angry at him. I think it's going to be Kaladin. Kaladin's going to get him.
Leopold Magnus 01:03:07 Dario, I'm coming to help you.
Dungeon Master 01:03:14 Caledon, you're up. 26 hits.
Kaladin Shash 01:03:16 Oh, got the hot hand. All right, I'll just stay where I'm at, and I'll use a first level chromatic orb. OK, there we go, 26 dead. And then just to cause, it won't take a lot of damage, but just to guarantee it won't. That's not a bad rule.
Kaladin Shash 01:03:47 Uh, I'll do lightning damage so that it has the same. Paralysis effects again or whatever you call them. Yeah. Oh, did he OK? Oh, that's great. Yes, I didn't catch that. Let's do. Let's do thunder damage.
Dungeon Master 01:03:56 And then Zariel did just do that, so you could pick a different element type to try to do more damage. Thunder damage. Nice. Hurting, but not dead.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:13 Nice. Oof. Steel Defender's gonna get the kill.
Dungeon Master 01:04:24 After your turn, Leopold is up. Leopold, it is your turn.
Kaladin Shash 01:04:26 That's OK. Six rounds to get a hit. Got it. Got it.
Leopold Magnus 01:04:46 Oh, it's my go. Thanks. Yeah, so after yelling out to Zario, just trying to act very cool and pretend like he doesn't need the help, but Leopold knows that he needs some help. I'll kind of stand up, dust myself off from all the swampy bits, and I will launch
Leopold Magnus 01:05:13 At the first level, I will do a catapult, which is a deck save of 16.
Dungeon Master 01:05:26 What are you catapulting? Do it. It only gets us to 7 on the deck save.
Zariel Torgan 01:05:31 The Steel Defender. Awesome. Awesome.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:33 You know, I was going to say that I don't have much movement. I'm going to grab this steel defender. I'm going to kind of like stick them inside my chest cavity and I'm going to. And the defender. OK, the defender is going to go flying through the air, spinning kind of like a giant corkscrew with a steel sword erected straight in front of him, and he will take.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:06 15 damage. 3d6, okay.
Dungeon Master 01:06:08 Good thing kinds of damage. Go ahead and roll. Go ahead and roll 3D6 damage. For your steel defender. Yeah, just lower in the dice count by one.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:36 Nine damage. The defender? Yeah, 27, but I think he took some hits, so he took a little damage earlier. 22 hit points. Okay. And the toad is still up.
Dungeon Master 01:06:40 And he's got 21 HP to start with? Yeah. OK. He's at 8 HP. OK. It is so hurt, but it is still up.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:11 Okay, yeah, so then with my bonus action... Yeah, with my bonus action, I had casted the stones to bring them back up, right? So that's fresh. And now I'm at a distance, so I can attack without suffering disadvantage. 19 to hit.
Dungeon Master 01:07:15 technically your Steel Defender's turn or your bonus action. You did, yes. Nine disadvantage. Nineteen hits.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:37 Mm-mm. Gonna kill him with a rock. Yeah!
Leopold Magnus 01:07:40 Uh, 9 damage on the magic stone. Okay, yeah. So after ingesting the steel defender and launching him forward, Leopold just kind of abruptly stands up.
Dungeon Master 01:07:44 How would you like to do this?
Leopold Magnus 01:07:54 upright and one of the stones flowing above his shoulder zeros in and goes soaring past the steel defender, speed of sound, and makes a small entry point into the toad's eyeball in which the steel defender kind of spinning with his sword straight ahead of him just kind of blasts clean through the toad's head.
Kaladin Shash 01:08:11 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:08:17 The heck? Exploding behind it with this.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:17 in one eyeball out the other. And the steel defender just goes like rattling into miscellaneous parts on the outside of the toad landing on the forest floor.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:18 Let's listen in.
Dungeon Master 01:08:34 monstrous hit you guys take a second catching your breath heavy in your ears and then you look around and that's it there's no other creatures it seems to everything sort of takes a lull and then like the various sounds of nature start picking up you hear insects birds bugs things like that but you guys are you can do what you'd like
Kaladin Shash 01:09:00 I start walking back towards everybody. How are you guys doing that? That looks so hard to hit.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:13 Well, Kaladin, I think it was just my lucky day, to be honest. And I bent down and I picked the coin up and its heads. Oh, man.
Dungeon Master 01:09:22 He really had to try his hardest.
Zariel Torgan 01:09:29 That's funny. Yeah, it's just one of those things that my lightening, I thought, you know, hey, it's wet and slippery, but it didn't seem to hurt it much, but it definitely seemed to make it discombobulated. So that's, that's good.
Kaladin Shash 01:09:48 Jonathan, can I?
Leopold Magnus 01:09:51 I think I'm grabbing a stick. Is there like slime on this toad? It's kind of covered in gross slime like is drooling from his mouth. Yeah, and I kind of gather up a bit and I go, Kaladin, he was quite a slippery fellow. Maybe that's why he couldn't make contact. And I will put a little bit of that toad spit in a vial. Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:09:57 It's going to be. But right down to file of code.
Kaladin Shash 01:10:17 Inspect the. Can I inspect the hindquarters where you describe the cloth being stuck? Alright, well, outside of battle. Let's
Dungeon Master 01:10:26 Yeah, go and give me an investigation check. That's much better. No. I would describe it as one vial of code stripped.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:36 Jonathan, would you describe this toad spit as quite slippery? No? OK. All right, I was just curious. I mean, Kaladin couldn't hit it, so it seemed like maybe there's something to it. Fair enough.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:43 Oh shit. Oh yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:10:55 Listen, if Leopold wants to think that, he can, but I'm not. You don't get to write down anything other than Toadstool.
Kaladin Shash 01:11:04 I'm just getting used to the sword. First attack, first fight with the sword. It's deeply bothering me. Yeah, look at that guy.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:09 I like to imagine that Kaladin looks so good and is dressed so good that being knee deep in this muddy bog was just not fun. Yeah, I mean, look at that guy.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:25 That's great.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:34 Um, can I like, uh, put an ear to the ground real quick and see if I hear, I mean, that was loud. Can I see if I hear or see any like other big thing coming?
Dungeon Master 01:11:45 You don't have to put your ear to the ground necessarily because you like look around and there's so much water that separates the like main pieces of soil and grass that it would be lost in the water. You just sort of picture that being sort of a nature guy. But you do just take a beat and listen and you can give me like a perception check to see if you hear anything. What do you want? Don't hear anything.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:08 21.
Leopold Magnus 01:12:15 Jonathan, can I do a repair on my still defender? I don't even know if that's just an action, I guess. I could probably do that in combat again.
Dungeon Master 01:12:20 Yes, you can. Oh, what did you get on your check? It was 24. It was good. I didn't see anything yet. I got distracted. Dick Cloth. You? 24 is pretty good.
Kaladin Shash 01:12:28 I'm sorry, what did you? What did you tell us about the cloth that was stuck in his leg? Like 2024, yeah. OK. Roger that.
Dungeon Master 01:12:48 I want to give you more. Go ahead and give me a. History check. To see if you can remember something. Otherwise it'll just be like good information, but not great. 11 is just not quite enough, so you're looking at this cloth and it's.
Kaladin Shash 01:12:59 Okay. Oh, it's a 17 to 07.
Dungeon Master 01:13:15 you're feeling it and it's really dirty so you like maybe press the digitate a spot if you have that cantrip like you clean it up best you can and you're feeling it and you're like this is this is just like regular cloth this is like silk material from like a shirt and you're like feeling it doesn't make a lot of sense and then like
Dungeon Master 01:13:33 the way it distributes around the body it almost looks like this creature was wearing something before it grew into this monstrous size and like the tatters teared at places and got stuck in others um indicating maybe it was wearing cloth but like I said that the second rule wasn't quite high enough to get more than that
Kaladin Shash 01:13:50 Okay. Okay. I would share this idea with everybody.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:00 Can I cast Healing Spirit while we're doing this? So I can heal up a little bit. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:14:01 That's interesting.
Dungeon Master 01:14:12 it.
Leopold Magnus 01:14:20 Jonathan, can I make a like a medicine or animal handling or maybe something to kind of investigate this creature a little further? Maybe take a look kind of in its in its gullet, see if it's eating anything interesting recently. Yeah. OK.
Dungeon Master 01:14:38 uh give me interesting looking in this goal specifically you can give me like an investigation fact next thing you're looking through uh first thing is like you're like reaching in as you find like
Kaladin Shash 01:14:41 you
Leopold Magnus 01:14:50 19.
Dungeon Master 01:14:58 the decomposing and crushed form of that like large beetle and like it's you know decentralized organ system and all that stuff like you're just like scooping by all the goop uh and then you see like other animals a hind limbs some bones things like that but you find an interesting thing of like a boot in its in its gut as you're like really in there
Kaladin Shash 01:15:11 it.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:26 Yeah, I'll, I'll, uh, fish that out. Oh, okay. I'll fish that out and, uh, maybe kind of show it to the team. It looks like this fella has been eating somebody with footwear.
Dungeon Master 01:15:26 which strikes you as odd because you were outside of the dome. In theory, there wouldn't be a boot.
Kaladin Shash 01:15:47 Does the boot look like like the one that would be fashioned in the dome? Or is it look more simple? OK. We know that sometimes people come outside of the wall.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:54 Oh, good call. Good call. Well.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:57 Yeah, I'll pass it to Kaladin.
Dungeon Master 01:15:58 It looks of similar fashion as you have seen people wearing, yes. Mid to late afternoon.
Kaladin Shash 01:16:14 Can we move forward or look first? I mean, it's still mid afternoon, right? No. Why not we? We watched our own. Well, we watched our crew just what a week ago when we opened the dome. Right, have that battle. Why then?
Zariel Torgan 01:16:24 We wouldn't think that this thing would have eaten a person, right? I mean, not recently, because... Yeah, I guess. I guess my thought is, like, what are the odds that this thing ate one of those dudes? Like, that's, like, astronomical.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:46 Yeah. Is there, I mean, that would have been. Go ahead.
Kaladin Shash 01:16:48 Right, but open the door. I'm assuming we've opened the dome several times. Yeah. Right.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:55 I think that was the first time, wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah, so I mean like... So yeah, either these are really good boots or...
Dungeon Master 01:16:58 That was, that you, the dome had been opened? First time in a long time. First time the dome has physically been opened, but there have been, like, there used to be travel outside of the dome as, like, inner dome travel, and people would go out into the nature and look at things, like, it used to be something that happened before the curse sort of took root.
Leopold Magnus 01:17:23 Jonathan, does this? Yeah, I was just curious, I mean, the boot from an omen night or any of those soldiers that went out through the dome would be pretty, pretty distinct, right? Compared to just kind of common. Right, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:17:26 you
Zariel Torgan 01:17:35 Yeah. All right. Something to think about. Yeah, so are we wanting to just, well, real quick as a group, what are we doing? Are we...
Dungeon Master 01:17:35 It doesn't look like a militaristic, you know, identifiable, like, uniform boot. It just looks like of the fashion that people would be wearing without the dome.
Kaladin Shash 01:18:03 I thought we were trying to head to where we thought the battle occurred. Right, so I feel like there's this. I feel like we discussed having like a suspicion that. We're not being told everything that. You know the Legionnaire or whoever is governing the core understands.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:07 to investigate a little bit, see if we gather some clues about the outside. Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking.
Dungeon Master 01:18:12 The consensus, yeah, was to head back to the dome. You were going back at this point.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:20 Okay, yeah. Okay. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:18:33 Right, and you already made the comment that maybe they're doing it out of control. So hopefully that battle just confirms or denies sort of this thesis. I think we have a long way to go.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:44 So we should probably kind of be careful on our approach, maybe be a little sneaky.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:50 I think you're absolutely right. Yeah, when we start to get close, Jonathan, or would we know what close looks like? All right, sweet. Well, when we get within like,
Dungeon Master 01:18:57 Yeah, I mean you guys have been making your way towards the dome over the like the span of the day so far And you it's like looming. It's it's so tall that you guys are like heading right at it
Kaladin Shash 01:19:04 We still have to skirt around it. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:19:15 five minutes of where we know we're going to be. I'd like to pass without a trace, see if we can get right up to it without getting spotted. But yeah, I'm good to keep rocking. Did we want to short rest or anything, or did we want to just start cooking?
Dungeon Master 01:19:25 Nice. We'll have that go and do it for me. We don't have...
Leopold Magnus 01:19:29 Let's go. Keep it up.
Kaladin Shash 01:19:34 You if you want to heal we can wait and start moving forward that also helps you regain the bear come on Make sure
Zariel Torgan 01:19:49 Yeah, I get a, yeah, yeah, okay. I'll do that. Okay. So that's 2d8 plus three. So that's 2d8 total plus six. So that's 13.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:16 Okay, and then I get a bare form back, so okay, cool. All right, I'm ready to rock.
Dungeon Master 01:20:25 Alright, I don't have like an inner travel thing map, so you guys just look at the map. You guys make your way through that was. I don't remember exactly which one it wasn't your first check of the day, so like you get back on your way. You're just sort of slowly moving towards the dome will say we'll have one more encounter check as you guys like hit that 5 minute mark that you would sort of outlined. So whoever wants to give like the next encounter check.
Dungeon Master 01:20:54 Also, you just don't want super low at this point.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:59 I think it's gotta be Kaladin, right? He's rolled so many low ones, statistically. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:21:05 All right, here we go. There you go.
Leopold Magnus 01:21:05 Yeah, you might as well stay hot.
Dungeon Master 01:21:32 Can you guys hear me? My audio is not coming out of my headphones for some reason. Well, I can hear you guys.
Kaladin Shash 01:21:34 Yeah. What? What?
Zariel Torgan 01:21:34 Yeah. Should we just pretend like we can't hear him even when he gets back on? What's that?
Zariel Torgan 01:22:02 I keep hearing that we're going to level up. That's what I keep hearing. Yeah, I know. It's like, we're already level 8. I mean, I think going just straight to 10 doesn't seem fair.
Dungeon Master 01:22:05 Okay, whatever, I fixed it. Nice try. 18 of the dice is good. You guys are making your way through. It's a nice easy walk. You guys are welcome to have some chats as you're going. We'll say it only takes like
Kaladin Shash 01:22:08 Again.
Dungeon Master 01:22:31 an hour or two total to get to that point but then as you guys will say you'll do pass without a trace and that will give you enough passive stuff that you won't be like very noticeable because the dome carries sort of like a opaqueness it's not completely see-through in general so also hiding is going to give you you're pretty much not going to be seen um so as you guys sort of approach you hear like
Dungeon Master 01:22:57 as you get closer it gets a little bit clearer but there's some like some static at first and then the next time you hear it a couple minutes later it's like a little bit less static and a little bit more like can you hear me it's like sort of trying to feed through and as you guys sort of like we'll say are approaching getting right up front to where you think the arcane splitter was you guys are still we'll say 100 200 yards away
Dungeon Master 01:23:24 um you get like a very clear message that just almost sounds pre-recorded just on a loop you figure it's the same thing that's been playing that's like um uh adventuring party oh dears report in lost contact time span two days and then it just repeats that can you hear me
Dungeon Master 01:23:48 party adventures, odiers, no contact, two days, sort of just looping. And you guys know that this is your second day. You did take like a rest in the cavern before you reported back in.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:06 Yeah, I reckon it's about time we nail some things down before we move forward too far.
Kaladin Shash 01:24:08 I think we need to talk about some things. Tell me more about what you think when you implied that perhaps the organization is doing more than we believe.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:38 Well, I'm just going basically off of a hunch here, but seems to me that ruling class's ability to keep an entire population
Zariel Torgan 01:24:53 completely cut off from the rest of the world be a tremendous source of control. And seeing as though we've only ventured a day outside of the dome and almost everything we've been told about the exterior conditions is inaccurate,
Kaladin Shash 01:25:19 Hmm.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:21 The one glimpse that we saw and that our population saw was of a wasteland, you know? I mean, it was like a storm. I mean, it was like evil. And what are the odds that we open the door one time and everybody dies and then, you know, the three of us, you know, we just make our way out some random spot and it's like beautiful. And if it wasn't for Leo trying to ride that frog, we would have strolled all the way here, no problem.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:52 So I just, I don't know, I don't, I don't trust these guys. I don't trust the, at least the, at least what they're being told is right.
Leopold Magnus 01:25:59 Well, I'd like to point out that if I had rode that toad, we wouldn't have to walk here. But I do agree with both of you. There is some strange business afoot, and I don't know if we can fully trust our bosses.
Kaladin Shash 01:26:08 I agree. Let us proceed this way, but perhaps, perhaps we're not done, at least for now, working with Blue Engineer, no? Perhaps we can learn more.
Kaladin Shash 01:26:37 We know a way out of the dome already.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:38 Yeah. I would also venture to guess that us letting on that we've been outside the dome would be, if my assumption is correct, would be quite dangerous for us. It's like that
Leopold Magnus 01:26:41 I think that's a wise idea, but we must remain cautious and tread lightly. I think that will be the right time, and we'll know when it comes.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:07 that movie The Village by M. Night Shyamalan. You know, the moment we know what's out there, we become a threat to the stability of our dome. I don't know if y'all have seen it, so I won't ruin it, but there's a twist.
Leopold Magnus 01:27:19 Well, Zario, I don't remember that picture in the library. What exactly happened?
Kaladin Shash 01:27:33 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:35 And it's, uh, unexpected. Uh, yeah. Have you guys seen that one? I think everybody's seen it. Oh. Yeah, it's like an M. Night Shyamalan movie where, like, it's like this, like, horror, like, old school, like,
Leopold Magnus 01:27:44 Uh, no, I haven't. No, that's uh, what what what is it the village? Maybe I saw it on tv once Okay Right, right
Zariel Torgan 01:27:59 you're not sure how back far in time it is, but like, there's like these things that kill people out in the woods and you're never supposed to venture this far from camp. And it's like, anyway, and there's a big twist reveal at the end. So, but I won't ruin it for you. Yeah. Anyway. Yeah. The twist is it was like a cult and that like this chick, I think she was blind.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:14 That sounds vaguely familiar. I don't think I'll watch it. I get the point. That's probably exactly what's happening inside that dome. Stupid Truman show.
Dungeon Master 01:28:20 A twist that it was modern times. It was fun. Yeah, it called. I ripped on the village.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:29 Anyway, yeah. Yeah, we're gonna get out. It's just gonna be like us. Yeah, he's got his camera off, but Jonathan's violently sweating. Totally revealed his village plot.
Kaladin Shash 01:28:48 No. As we.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:50 Okay. Well, what do you suggest, Zariel? How do you think we can seal this?
Dungeon Master 01:28:51 Oh.
Zariel Torgan 01:29:05 Well, I mean, I'm not the talking one of the group, but I imagine we need to come up with a plausible reason why we have been outside of calm range if we plan on continuing to be part of the Legionnaires.
Zariel Torgan 01:29:22 I think it's a good idea, Callen. I think we stand to gain more information and skill by not just heading off as enticing as that might be, but just having all of our ducks in a row, I think would be smart. You know, coming up with a good plan that we all agree on where we've been, you know, something reasonable.
Kaladin Shash 01:29:34 Yes, if we go back upstream all the way and just say we were lost in the caverns, you know, communications did not work. It's like a maze down there.
Zariel Torgan 01:30:01 Absolutely. I think we could even say that we fell in that hole. Say, yeah, we were down in that hole. Yeah, we fell down. We made a boat because we were planning on riding it, but it was a terrible idea and so it didn't work, even though obviously it's not true and it did work. I mean, that's really close to the truth.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:22 Hmm, I do like where your heads are at. I think that's quite nice. You know, I could rub some mud all over these gears and we could pretend that in a clumsy misstep I tumbled down a cavern hole and got stuck headfirst. Probably, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:30:23 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, rub some more mud on there.
Zariel Torgan 01:30:37 Hasn't, haven't you been like climbing in and out of a dead frog in a marsh? Aren't you just like filthy? Yeah, just covered, you know, smell lines coming off of him. Yeah. That's funny. Yeah. They're never going to believe.
Dungeon Master 01:30:48 He says that absolutely covered in shit. Some gunk, like, falls off of his elbow when he says that. Slaps on the ground. I want to clarify something. I want to make sure we don't get our wires crossed.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:54 Well, we have to really sell it.
Zariel Torgan 01:31:06 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:31:13 Are you guys going to the spot where the dome was opened, getting in and then telling them you got in through the chapel? All right, and it has been a pretty substantial fall into the hole.
Kaladin Shash 01:31:22 No, no. I think we'll have to literally try to go all the way back. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:31:28 Yeah, go take a look, scout it out, don't be seen, backtrack, go through the tunnel. Now, okay, hold on. Do I have the blueprints to the Arcane Splitter?
Zariel Torgan 01:31:37 Yeah, I think, I think, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:31:43 So you guys would either have to try to overcome that or find a different way out. Is that something you're willing to do? You probably have them vaguely like, you know, parts of it, but that wasn't a project that like you were responsible for. So you don't have that. And that was something handbook code.
Leopold Magnus 01:32:05 Okay. Like, I mean, is there a way I could make a roll and maybe we could collect some things and sneak in through the drone? Like... I see. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:32:12 It is only on the other side of the dome. That's what I was trying to clarify. I didn't want you guys to walk all the way up and expect to be able to sneak in because you can't access it. Somebody would have to open it from the inside.
Kaladin Shash 01:32:23 Right? Yeah, I was. I was expecting just to see if it looked like they set up camp and hiked away. Was there a slaughter? Are they still set up there, right? That's what I that's what I'm excited like that's what we're trying to do.
Zariel Torgan 01:32:23 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:32:37 Yeah. You know what else, Jonathan? Can I make a perception or investigation check? Can I look to see if there's any smoke in the skyline? Is there any evidence of civilization out here?
Dungeon Master 01:32:50 Yeah, before that, just so I know, how close did you guys get to the dome when you go to like, make this check? Like, where are you guys in relation to it when you're having this conversation? Okay.
Kaladin Shash 01:33:02 I think probably stopped right when we could begin to hear communications. So whatever that is for you.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:08 Yeah, I think we want to just clarify once we remember before we get there. And I imagine that then we're going to go check out the site.
Dungeon Master 01:33:23 Okay, so you were like, I'll say when you first started here in communications, you're like, 300 yards, you're pretty, pretty far, when it's like initial static, and then you get like, about 200 yards out. 150 yards out, you can sort of make out a full clear message. You guys stop, you have a powwow, you say you're going to go look at this site, and then you're going to backtrack, correct?
Zariel Torgan 01:33:45 Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:33:48 Correct.
Dungeon Master 01:33:50 Okay, cool. On the same page. Love it. Yes, they both go ahead and give me your like about 150 yards out from the dome. So like that puts you guys if you made it that far, you're sort of a little bit more on the north side of it. So looking to your like southeast, you're pretty much just seeing enormous arcane dome, you can't see anything, but everything sort of looking north
Dungeon Master 01:34:16 Northeast and then like all through the West is unobscured because you're mostly in like a plains. Give me a perception check. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:34:23 OK, and I guess, yeah, is it is it possible? Is there anything? Like any semblance of civilization or evidence like? OK, yeah. Ah. Tragic natural one.
Zariel Torgan 01:34:38 Is your Spotify still playing? That's weird. I tried rejoining a couple of times. It's just not working. Oh, bummer.
Kaladin Shash 01:34:42 Yeah. Nope.
Dungeon Master 01:34:54 Yeah, nothing you can tell. I think you just kind of keep getting caught up in how nice it is that even unintentionally looking around you're like. It's it's just very nice. Rolling Hills gradually changing. You've got like.
Dungeon Master 01:35:14 like it rolls up to a pretty tall hill and then you see like trees around it and dips down and you like came from one of that areas when you were going through like the boggy area so while there is different biomes and vegetation type you're like for the most part if you get to a high point you can see pretty far in each direction so it's really nice here.
Leopold Magnus 01:35:33 Are there a lot of trees around? OK. In the Emerald Grove, how large are the trees? What kind of foliage should they have? Is it unusual to see?
Dungeon Master 01:35:36 Pretty spread out, but not a huge concentration. Nothing where you would be like, that's a forest. Maybe you see something and you're like, oh, that's like a little orchard type thing, like just a small collection. Pretty variance in foliage because it's artificial made by druids. So you've got like,
Dungeon Master 01:36:04 You know, rainforest type vegetation, evergreens, you've got taiga, you've got like pines and evergreens and seasonal, you've got all the different types that are sort of forced into one mega city area. Some of them do, yeah. Not nearly the same biodiversity out here.
Leopold Magnus 01:36:20 Interesting. OK. And these species of tree, do they seem to overlap with the ones in the dome? I'll just keep pointing at trees, just so blown away with their majestic beauty of the surroundings. And I'll just every once in a while point
Leopold Magnus 01:36:43 Do a large tree, kind of grab Kaladin. Look at that tree! We'll do the same to Zarya a couple times while strolling. Just like a kid who first got out of the library and realized that there's a world outside of it.
Zariel Torgan 01:36:51 Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:36:52 Yes, very good. It's a beautiful tree. You're right. OK. How far away do we believe we are from where the splitter was used?
Dungeon Master 01:37:10 All right, and you guys are just sort of hanging out. What are you doing next? You feel like you're pretty close. Like if you looked around, you might be able to find the exact spot, but you're in the general area, you think.
Kaladin Shash 01:37:31 Can I make an investigation check to see if I notice large sets of prints moving in a general direction or was there evidence of camp set up? 26. Yeah, sorry, sorry, I'll see you too. You saw a tree.
Dungeon Master 01:37:41 Yeah, you guys can do investigation, you can do perception, anything sort of looking. That's very funny.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:48 Yeah, I'll do a perception. 26.
Leopold Magnus 01:37:50 I'll do another perception. Nice. Yeah, I don't see shit. I just have really narrow visors and all I can see are just like, yeah, these big trees.
Dungeon Master 01:38:12 two people who just see really well you guys are in the one person sees nothing you um you're moving around you're looking specifically for prints uh and you give up on that after a little bit just because it's been not like immediately been it's been at least a few days if not like
Dungeon Master 01:38:31 five, six, seven days since the full on attack on the market district on that big parade type deal. So footprints still being around would be hard pressed to find, especially because when you'd first seen through it, it was pretty stormy. It wasn't clear weather outside. But you're looking and
Kaladin Shash 01:38:49 We saw a lot of. Yep. I was gonna say, I feel like we saw like a giant like where something. Doing like. OK.
Dungeon Master 01:38:59 Yeah you saw like a giant lycanthropic creature of some kind but as you're like looking for tracks you do realize like with it being mostly like grassland and densely packed dirt when you do come across it you're like okay there's no prince that stayed this long but in your search of that you guys do
Dungeon Master 01:39:20 Find like a section of the dome that you can see through enough that you're like okay this definitely seems like the market district and then you sort of like narrow it down and definitely with 226 as you eventually happen upon.
Dungeon Master 01:39:34 the area that you're pretty sure is where the splitter is on the other side of the dome. It's like maybe where like the old entrance of the dome was intended to be. Like a lot of the vegetation is cleared away. There's no trees nearby. It's like open almost dirt pathway. The grass is sort of at bay in like a straight line for a certain distance, slowly overgrown. So like the farther it goes out, the less wide the pathing gets. It sort of fades into a triangle.
Dungeon Master 01:40:02 But as you sort of come up to the dome, you don't have to get right up next to it. We'll say 100 feet at the closest at times. You do see a weapon here. You see some tattered cloth. No bodies instantly. But you do find the one spot you're like, this is definitely where that fight happened.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:30 And with what we rolled, we feel pretty confident that this looks legit. We've seen fight scenes. This looks like roughly everything seems accurate. There's nothing that seems hokey. Is that going to be perception? I'm going to guide myself.
Kaladin Shash 01:40:30 OK. I'm not. Another investigation is that we've got. Go.
Dungeon Master 01:40:43 I'll keep your other checks in mind, but everybody go ahead and give me another check just to assess for if this is legit. Yeah. Whatever check you made last time, you can just do again. Yeah, absolutely. 30, 20, 21.
Leopold Magnus 01:40:48 Can I do a... Yeah. Jonathan, can I do an investigation check? I didn't know that was an option. Okay. Yeah, that would be way... 15.
Kaladin Shash 01:40:59 Dance on a 20 for a second
Zariel Torgan 01:41:07 Gertie20
Dungeon Master 01:41:13 15 all pretty good good average the main thing I wanted was for Leopold to find it to I wanted everybody to be in on it as you guys are looking through. You're sort of moving more north sort of circling around the dome just sort of like analyzing and eventually you see fully like.
Dungeon Master 01:41:35 propped up against the arcane wall. Like head down, a figure seems to be just like laying, unmoving. You guys are pretty far away still, but just like up against the dome wall. Off of the main fight area, almost like whatever happened was drug out some distance before this figure fell.
Kaladin Shash 01:42:00 OK, so we can tell you instead. Can I can I still like? I just definitely move forward and check. You got. You got passed without a trace, correct?
Zariel Torgan 01:42:01 This figure, yeah, they did. Somebody throw a rock.
Dungeon Master 01:42:05 You guys are not super close. Kind of hard to tell. Yeah, give me a stealth check. That only lasts for an hour.
Leopold Magnus 01:42:15 I could launch a stone.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:31 Yeah. Well, I wanted to wait until we were like 10 minutes away. Or yeah, five minutes away, sorry. God damn. Oh my God.
Dungeon Master 01:42:38 Okay, so you still have it. 37. You're so stealthy. You feel like the light is being almost sucked in with your sword, like just absorbed from the area, your colors blend and you sort of glide through this environment. You get really close to the figure and what you see is not really what you expect to see.
Kaladin Shash 01:42:38 five minutes from our spot solution. I got a natural 20 for 27.37.
Leopold Magnus 01:42:46 Nice. That's what he needed.
Dungeon Master 01:43:08 This figure is definitely what you had seen. You had seen this figure twice. The first time, this dark armored figure and the huge sword was seen taking out that creature on the edge of the Emerald Grove when you were trying to hide the body of that woman initially, if you guys remember that.
Kaladin Shash 01:43:29 Right. Yep.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:30 Mmm, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:43:30 And then you saw here again, when the Lord Marshal had wanted to run out of the dome to save the soldiers he had been called to something, and he dispatched this soldier to run out of the dome in his stead and you saw the last thing you saw was this figure sprinting out of the dome before it closed.
Dungeon Master 01:43:49 now laying unmoving, unresponsive, you like get up to the armor and maybe like tap the shoulder, completely unmoving and unresponsive. But at the abdomen, you see
Dungeon Master 01:44:04 Torn open where you would have expected to maybe see some gore bugs eating things like that you see this advanced system of clockwork years. Arcane horrors hoses machinery just in this like most advanced system very reminiscent of what you see going on in the inside of leopold armor.
Dungeon Master 01:44:30 So, like, this figure is unresponsive, unmoving, but they don't look human or undoven.
Kaladin Shash 01:44:41 OK. And with a 27, is there any way to tell if there is there any sign of breathing? Or am I assuming because of what I saw that they are only a bulb?
Dungeon Master 01:45:02 You are like analyzing it. You go to sense for breathing and you like touch the bottom of the mask in the right spot with a super high stealth check and then a pretty high perception check and the face mask pops up a little bit.
Dungeon Master 01:45:18 And you see that there isn't a face behind it, it wasn't designed, it was like whatever this is was crafted with the idea that there would be a mask over the face. You see like a blank slate and you see this
Kaladin Shash 01:45:28 OK. Is this the same school crusher that is on the back of? Leopold
Dungeon Master 01:45:34 symbol inscribed over the face of or over where would have been the face and this symbol is it almost looks like an iron gauntlet crushing a skull and like the skull is being crushed into a powder below it. It very well might be.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:57 Oh, shit.
Kaladin Shash 01:46:04 What is this? Oh my God.
Dungeon Master 01:46:06 And you have this almost out-of-body experience for a moment where you're shunted back in time. And you remember Leopold weirdly saying this one thing once where he goes, I don't know what it was, but I think I just missed something when he had been staring at this figure. And he couldn't figure out why there was something off about them. But he had reported that he felt like he
Dungeon Master 01:46:29 had a connection, but he couldn't articulate it no matter how hard he tried. Slaps you in the face right now. This figure has the same marking on. His was hidden. It was underneath the face mask of his helm, whereas Leopold's is underneath the cloak on his back.
Kaladin Shash 01:46:34 OK. Yeah. I think I would. Make my way back over to. Leopold Zario. That is the elder tonight that we saw.
Kaladin Shash 01:47:07 But he's not dead. I don't know. I think one of you should check. He appears to be made of the same stuff you are. Also, when I walk up behind him, can I lift up his cloak? Do they look the exact same? Leopold, what do you not remember because
Leopold Magnus 01:47:10 Oh, dear.
Dungeon Master 01:47:12 They look the exact same.
Zariel Torgan 01:47:27 Jesus Christ.
Kaladin Shash 01:47:36 That knight has the same logo under his helm as you have.
Leopold Magnus 01:47:43 But I'm kind of spinning and my cape is flapping while they're trying to look at what what are you two looking at back there? Yeah, and I don't I don't think. I, Leopold, no, I guess I have said I know what it says, but I'd like to think that he doesn't really know what it means. So
Leopold Magnus 01:48:08 Yeah, skull crusher. Yes, indeed. That is what it says. I don't know why. Not exactly sure. What do you mean he's not alive and he's not dead? Is he going to make it, do you think?
Kaladin Shash 01:48:24 Perhaps you both should check Other than him did we see anything else any other bodies any other? Yeah, yes, we'll just reapproach
Zariel Torgan 01:48:29 Did, did Kaladin touch him? Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:31 Well, okay, yeah, maybe we should take a look, but it seems brash to walk right up. Do you think we should still be careful?
Dungeon Master 01:48:44 You don't see anything else. Yeah, nothing. Yeah, he like pressed on his shoulder to see if he had moved and the armor was cold and it was unresponsive. But looking at like the thrashed open like abdomen, there were like powered arcane cores like there's still stuff working on the inside, but there's no movement externally.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:59 All right, yeah, so I'll... Okay. I don't know what we gain by messing with this guy. If he comes back to life,
Kaladin Shash 01:49:10 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:25 While we're there he will have seen us out and we'll have to explain that and if he doesn't Other than seeing what what you saw You know But uh
Leopold Magnus 01:49:40 Well, I gotta say that I think Leopold wouldn't be able to resist taking a look. Callaghan really piqued his interest. He doesn't quite know why that makes sense, like what this thing is. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:53 Yeah, yeah, well, no, let's definitely take a peek. I'm just saying as far as like trying to wake him up or something, you know? Yeah, OK, yeah, yeah, let's check it out. Can steal his batteries.
Kaladin Shash 01:49:57 Yeah, waking or healing, no way.
Leopold Magnus 01:50:07 So Jonathan, can I make an investigations check to see where the power source is for this suit of armor? 23.
Dungeon Master 01:50:17 Yeah, go ahead. 23 there are several. There's you find that it's not one centralized.
Zariel Torgan 01:50:25 Damn.
Kaladin Shash 01:50:27 you.
Dungeon Master 01:50:30 power system. Unlike yours, you have a central core where your energy is stored, your main being that operates everything. You see multiple areas isolated from each other as you're digging through this body. And you notice that as you're
Dungeon Master 01:50:51 prying into this torn open chest piece this body's not moving at all it does not appear that this figure is at this point knowing like its autonomy and everything going on it doesn't seem sentient at this time
Kaladin Shash 01:51:03 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:51:08 It is like a hunk of metal. There is stuff working, maybe the most basic of like processing power for this ancient technology. But like you guys see Leopold is like digging through his chest to figure out his power system and the figure is not watching.
Dungeon Master 01:51:24 But Leopold, you are looking through this and what strikes you is how similar the design is between your body and this body. But to put it in perspective, it is almost looking at like the alpha and then like 2.0, not even beta or like release. It is like looking at a much more advanced design than your form. They're of the same origin.
Kaladin Shash 01:51:48 Anyway.
Leopold Magnus 01:51:55 but more advanced than my armor, is that what you're saying? I see, okay. Right, is there a way I could make another check to see if there's anything interesting that's implemented that's an improvement to what I have, something that maybe I can make note of and attempt to integrate into my suit later?
Dungeon Master 01:51:57 Way more than. It looked like you were a prototype to whatever this is in equivalence, right? Like you are the same idea, but this is executed at a much higher level. Depending on how much time you want to spend with it.
Leopold Magnus 01:52:25 Okay, I guess, um, how much is a torso weight? Is it pretty, pretty massive? I got a strength of 15. Is that unreasonable to carry?
Dungeon Master 01:52:31 The whole thing is a couple hundred pounds. You can probably throw it in the workshop, too, if you wanted.
Leopold Magnus 01:52:47 Oh, yeah, OK. So I'll bug Zariel and I'll say, this thing is quite interesting. I think I can extract some fairly useful designs from it. Any chance you'd let me store it in your workshop, Zariel?
Zariel Torgan 01:52:48 Yeah. Well Leo, we could do that but I mean it's a lot like you Leo. I mean if you're thinking and feeling and living,
Kaladin Shash 01:53:09 Leave it.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:19 Are you sure you want to take it apart or? Maybe it's got a family and memories and. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I just maybe I don't know. Just be careful.
Leopold Magnus 01:53:24 Well, I think I'd need to investigate to understand a little bit more behind these creatures. It might come in handy to understand how they tick. They seem to be the premier soldiers at the Legion. Yes, indeed. I wouldn't want to distress any souls bound to this creature.
Leopold Magnus 01:53:54 I just kind of end up staring at my hands and fade off. Yeah. So I'm going to grab the torso arms, legs, whatever kind of parts are easily accessible.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:57 All right, I'll open up the workshop and just get all put in there, help haul it in.
Dungeon Master 01:54:12 Nice. Yeah, it's a full form. Again, it's bound together like yours are. All the joints fit together with different advanced gear mechanisms to make it look just like a fluid form. So it's got legs, torso, pelvis, arms, head. It's just like, if it is sitting,
Dungeon Master 01:54:37 upright at like 90 degrees, its head's tilted forward, its legs are directly in front of it, it's just midsection, we'll say like right shoulder to like left oblique is torn open. Like this definitely was in a fight with that creature before it was destroyed. Give me another investigation check if you'd like.
Leopold Magnus 01:54:53 OK. Cool. Nice.
Kaladin Shash 01:54:57 Do we see it stored anywhere? 21. Yeah, giant.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:00 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:55:08 Yeah, that's pretty good. You see, like 30 feet off embedded in a tree, the buster cloud buster sword style weapon of like the huge blade is tall as a person is halfway through a tree trunk.
Leopold Magnus 01:55:26 Like a massive claymore.
Kaladin Shash 01:55:28 I just go retrieve it. I'm going to put it in the workshop for now. Are we going to, what time of day is it now, Jonathan? You said we hiked for like another two hours? OK. OK, do we want to try to make our, yeah, what were you going to say?
Zariel Torgan 01:55:34 Yeah, I'll open it back up and we'll hang on to it. I was just gonna say the same thing. Do you wanna hoof it or do you always wanna try to find camp?
Dungeon Master 01:55:43 Yeah, getting close to it's like evening. It's like, um, you know, we'll can just call it summer right now. Sunsets at like eight 30. It's like five or six. You got a few hours of sunlight.
Kaladin Shash 01:56:03 I think if we find camp, I would want to mess around with the mask. Yeah. Yeah. Um, did we discuss, we can't move the toolbox, but we can be in the toolbox. It just, it's just stationary.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:08 Mm-hmm. I mean, if we're going to mess with it anywhere, I think outside of the dome to our own devices is where we do it. So I don't mind that.
Dungeon Master 01:56:26 Once the tool is deployed, it's stationary, yeah. I love that because I thought about exactly that kind of thing. I was like, how would you guys use that if you wanted to? Pretty much what I came up with.
Kaladin Shash 01:56:29 I mean, yeah, I don't feel too bad about just using the toolbox area. We could try to cover it with a shrub as we walk in, and that way it's sort of hidden.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:41 Yeah, I'm good with that.
Dungeon Master 01:56:58 Yeah, you guys move away from the dome a little bit, you find like some overbrush that you can push backwards, you open the toolbox, open the lid, the ladder deploys down, it sort of grows in size a little bit to accommodate you. And then like you guys sort of go in one at a time. And the last person just sort of pulls the shrubbery back over and it feels like a pretty good fix.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:27 Sweet. Well, I don't have anything planned for the evening. So if we want to jump right into what you guys are doing, I'm cool.
Kaladin Shash 01:57:30 Yeah, can I, I'm sure we left the mask on a bench or a shelf or something. Can I walk over to the mask and pick it up?
Dungeon Master 01:57:48 Yeah, you pick it up, you look it over, you feel that draw that you always feel when you pick it up, almost like it's whispering to you. You get just an air of wildflowers fills your nose. The plant growth on the inside of the mass seems to have wilted a little bit, but it's still present, still pretty green.
Kaladin Shash 01:58:14 Um, I think I would look over my shoulder to Leopold and Dorian just... I think I'm going to try to put the mask on. Perhaps just keep an eye on me.
Zariel Torgan 01:58:33 Now, Galladin, I mean, what's our exit strategy here? The last two people we saw with this thing on, they took it off and they didn't fare too well. I'll trust you, I just want...
Kaladin Shash 01:58:51 It's difficult to explain, but I don't feel the mask will be dangerous to me. Yes. We're a team. Let's hope this goes okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:59:02 Just want you to know we care.
Dungeon Master 01:59:18 Awesome. It's got a strap that goes over the top. You hold it. The leather sort of groans a bit as you pull it back over the occipital of your head. The back just sort of fits very snugly. You take a deep breath in, and it almost feels like it suctions in just
Kaladin Shash 01:59:20 I just pull it on, pull it right over my face, head. Is it like a, is it a buckle or something or is it just a strap? Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:59:49 and it seals and you guys everything sort of billows out nicely like almost like a wave goes invisibly through the air everything ruffles your clothes blow back but you don't get like shunted or anything you guys will go over what you see first
Dungeon Master 02:00:08 uh leopold and zariel in the shop you see um instantly kaladin sort of lifts off the ground for a moment his toes pointing slightly downward his form raises up a slight bit his mostly rounded ears a slight point to signify his like pretty pure elven heritage drastically elongate
Dungeon Master 02:00:37 and point up a little bit and back, giving him a much more fey appearance. His hair, normally so platinum and white, you see at certain angles as it like flows, hints of green gleam through. His form gets a little more lithe. He gets a little bit taller.
Zariel Torgan 02:00:38 Oh shit.
Dungeon Master 02:01:01 his eyes sharpen at the corners and they're not open. You see maybe a, a slight glow coming from like his sealed lids. And then he pauses and he almost just sort of like, you almost hear like, you know, in movies you have like the glistening of ice in a cave, just like little sounds back and forward, just sort of play with the depth of everything as he sort of just sits there stagnant.
Dungeon Master 02:01:28 At that time though, Kaladin, you put on the mask and the last thing you feel before everything blacks out for a second is that suction. It almost feels like it seals into you as a person and then nothing. And then not nothing but just darkness and you hear a pleasant voice
Dungeon Master 02:01:53 A woman just talking with a nice southern drawl as she addresses you, and she's just going, oh dear, when you wake up, the world's going to be a big mess, I tell you that. But you are important. You're important for so many reasons that I wish I could tell you, Cal.
Dungeon Master 02:02:12 You'll figure it out in time, I promise. We all have to leave, me most important, but when we aren't abandoning you, almost addressing you in the dark, and that sort of fades out, and you feel like you're living.
Dungeon Master 02:02:26 Years, years fade to decades, decades to hundreds of years, thousands of years, millennia. You are in this darkness that eventually you see like a little plant sort of sprout in time lapse out of the ground, sort of hitting sharp edges as like time passes so suddenly. And the one plant turns to a bunch of grass, turns to a field of grass, turns to a forest, turns to a dense rainforest, breaks back down to a wasteland, it rinses and repeats, and you're sort of experiencing this cycle of nature over and over again. And eventually things slow down.
Dungeon Master 02:02:57 You were on this lush, green haven. You see birds in the sky. You see water flowing upwards from like the pond up a hill to the top of a river. And it's very fey. And you know instantly you're in the fey wild. Like the sky has got a pink hue to it. It's not the normal realm you're from. It's just things you've read about. But it's where you usually have your dreams. And you feel your body sort of set down. And
Dungeon Master 02:03:27 For the first time instead of feeling like you were having a dream looking through somebody's perspective, you have a weird deja vu moment where this is just now your perspective and you have sort of free range of your body as you are in this field.
Kaladin Shash 02:03:46 Do I see any, is this field like, is this a cultivated field or is this just like a wild grassy plain?
Dungeon Master 02:03:58 it's kind of a mix you do see like what you would consider to be like modified and harvested wheats like but it's not it's not organized traditional agriculture it's just like over this huge hill it's planted it's sparse there's some patches here and there but it is it is edible food if that makes sense it's not wild.
Kaladin Shash 02:04:19 Yeah. Do I see any, do I see any buildings on the horizon or larger structures?
Dungeon Master 02:04:26 Looking your vision sort of delays behind the action so you see an almost like a light trail goes off the direction where you were as you like adjust your vision. And you see, yeah, almost like hundred yards down the hill. This like point a little wooden shack is there that seems like there's a light on a fire.
Kaladin Shash 02:04:49 Can I walk towards the shack? Does it look like it's been empty for a long time, or is it
Dungeon Master 02:04:55 You walk towards and as you're walking, time seems to accelerate almost like you're walking towards the house and it becomes night, it becomes day and then you hit the door again and it's like same time of day that it was when you started walking. It's like midday again. Open the door, but it's empty. Nobody in there.
Kaladin Shash 02:05:19 I mean, is it dusty or is there even furniture or does it look like it's recently been used?
Dungeon Master 02:05:26 You're sort of investigating, looking through, and then you hear a voice from the doorway behind you. Just a fair, feminine voice, light, a little breathy. She just goes, there's nothing there yet. You haven't ate anything. And you turn and you see the woman who was unconscious. The woman you always see in the dream.
Dungeon Master 02:05:55 long hair flower sort of sprouting from different things she doesn't have a mask on her face so you see she's got nice full lips pointed cheekbones pointed ears pointed like sort of slants the ends of her eyes she's very fey and very fair in her presentation um you are 10 feet what was that you still don't know who this is
Kaladin Shash 02:06:14 Seeing her without the mask, do I know who she is? Where are we?
Dungeon Master 02:06:26 It's that gnawing feeling of like weird deja vu. You're like, I feel like I should know you, but you don't. She blows air out of her lips.
Dungeon Master 02:06:44 Well, I suppose this field had a name at some point, but I can't for the life of the gods remember what it was. I can tell you that we are, as you have probably presumed, in the Fae. Some distant time in the future. Thank you for putting on the mask. She levels her eyes at you very carefully.
Dungeon Master 02:07:11 I guess I'm dead in a traditional sense. It took a lot to get me to sort of the prime realm, but once we had felt your presence, we knew we had to try to make contact. But I'm not gone forever, I don't suppose. Obviously, I'm here now.
Kaladin Shash 02:07:12 Sorry, but who are you?
Dungeon Master 02:07:40 Don't be silly, you know me. She goes, my name is Faye, Faye Lara. Quizzical look crosses her face when she realizes that when she says her full name, that it doesn't ring a bell. She sort of tisks through her lips and her teeth. Doesn't seem as though you are quite yourself yet. That's okay.
Dungeon Master 02:08:11 I think we've all got time to wait for you. And then as she says that you hear it sort of drowns and you sort of can't help but sort of start to fall unconscious and you guys see that it's been two or three minutes on the outside.
Kaladin Shash 02:08:22 you.
Dungeon Master 02:08:24 But you see, like, it almost looks as though Kaladin is being physically yanked into his consciousness again. Like, his head is fighting it like he wants to stay where he was, but he's being forcefully, like, pulled into reality. And then he drops to the ground, boots with a solid thud, and he is standing in front of you, still wearing the mask, heavy, deep breaths. His form has not changed from what you guys saw.
Dungeon Master 02:08:54 It is still very, very elven and exaggerated. Well, there is like, this is not something anybody in that room has had experience with, but as far as like purity of bloodlines, it's like humans, half elf, elf, fey, elf.
Leopold Magnus 02:09:00 He became more elegant in appearance to us, and he didn't change back.
Dungeon Master 02:09:18 and he is beyond elf and he is verging into like the realm of the Fae. He is the most elven figure you have ever seen and it's not even close.
Leopold Magnus 02:09:32 Would Leopold have any recollection of seeing somebody, this elvish, or kind of bridging into that Feywild? Just like, would that strike any veins? Ooh, 27.
Dungeon Master 02:09:41 Give me, I love your question, especially with what you've seen recently, give me a history check. Play some guys, big role, big numbers on important roles. Leopold, you are, I think, struck by the beauty of your party member. He is so gorgeous in this moment and you're like, wow.
Zariel Torgan 02:09:55 Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:10:08 That's a great looking elf almost and then like your brain sparks and tweaks and you have a moment of you sort of get forced back into like one of the very few memories you can like resurface of.
Dungeon Master 02:10:21 you and your brother Victor standing next to this mentor in an unfamiliar building and you remember looking at this person who sort of taught you everything you had known about the arcane and you didn't really think it was important at the time but you're looking at this in this memory looking at this figure now and like in between the blurs of like sort of the pain of this memory you notice
Kaladin Shash 02:10:22 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:10:45 We'll be back.
Dungeon Master 02:10:47 pointed ears, a fair face. Your mentor previously was a very, very pureblood elven gentleman. So this is not the only elf you've seen, but this is maybe the only elf you've seen in a very, very long time.
Leopold Magnus 02:11:05 Well, kind of looking Kaladin up and down, you know, suddenly becoming more gorgeous in appearance, and I'll be like, oh, wow, wow, Kaladin, you're reminding me of my old mentor. You're quite strapping. That mask did you up one.
Kaladin Shash 02:11:24 I guess I sort of feel my ears and recognize that they're a little longer. Yes, quite.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:25 How are you? Feeling all right?
Dungeon Master 02:11:30 Yeah, you can't see yourself, but you reach to what he's like. Instantly, he mentions that you look more elven-y. You reach up and you're ear is twice as long going backwards.
Kaladin Shash 02:11:57 I saw a vision, I interacted with a Fae Elf, a woman named Fae Lara. I don't, I know her, but she laughed when I did not remember who I was. But, yes.
Kaladin Shash 02:12:26 Can I, can I try to remove the strap? No, it's a fifth.
Zariel Torgan 02:12:32 Calvin was a good character.
Dungeon Master 02:12:35 Yeah, give me a constitution saving throw. You take off the mask as the leather strap tightens going over the top of your head. Your hair ruffles. The mask hits the point where it like previously sealed. You give one pull to break the seal and nothing happens. You're fine.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:08 What, you took the mask off? Is that what happened? He's fine?
Kaladin Shash 02:13:13 Samsung. Yeah. Donald. Yeah. Watched.
Leopold Magnus 02:13:19 Does he stay, he stays more elvish? Interesting, okay. Well, how long do you suppose you were gone for, Kaladin?
Dungeon Master 02:13:23 Stay is more elvish, doesn't turn to stone. It felt like a million years. You saw the birth of an existence.
Kaladin Shash 02:13:48 I watched Melania pass, yes, I know. Yes, but... Yes, but it was the Feywild. This is a stranger place, and time is not always what we think time is.
Leopold Magnus 02:13:54 A millennia? Surely nobody could withstand such a torturous existence and still be mentally sound.
Zariel Torgan 02:14:20 Does the mask still look the same?
Dungeon Master 02:14:26 for the most part, looks like a little bit livelier, a little bit more verdant and green on the inside, but overall it's the same, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:14:40 Uhm? I think I've passed identify on this before, but now having worn it white, I have a better understanding of. What it's for. It's not just built for communication, is it? Do something else.
Dungeon Master 02:15:02 Yeah, hold on. I wrote it down somewhere. In essence, you have attuned with this item, but it doesn't take an attunement slot in the classic sense. But when you connected with it by wearing it, you know, I think, I can't find it right now, but I'm pretty sure I called it Breath of the Wild as a joke.
Zariel Torgan 02:15:32 Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:15:35 Let me figure out if I can find that, just to make sure. But anyway, yes, I can get you a more detailed thing later, just because I don't have it written out. Yes, I'll create an item that gives you the description of what it actually is.
Kaladin Shash 02:15:50 All right, so that's fine, but this is like an item that can be on me. OK, cool. And does it give me any immediate bonuses or perks? No, OK, that's cool. I love that.
Dungeon Master 02:16:08 We'll talk about it if you'd like. Nothing planned, I wanted to leave it up to me and you. Okay, I can't find where I actually wrote it, but I'm like 97% positive I called it Breath of the Wild. So you can put a placeholder.
Kaladin Shash 02:16:28 Okay. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:16:30 Was that in one of our past games? Got it. Well, I kind of look at Kaladin in a puzzled stance and say, I'm not quite sure what that all means, Kaladin, but it's certainly important.
Dungeon Master 02:16:33 No, this is something new, but Breath of the Wild is the name of The Legend of Zelda, obviously, like the new game. So I named it after that.
Leopold Magnus 02:17:00 What do you think we should do next?
Kaladin Shash 02:17:06 We should make our way back, but again, I think we have much to learn about the Legionnaires and more about the Corps. We need to discern if perhaps Captain Levi and the Ratshit are just like us, performing a duty, or if they understand that something greater is already happening. Perhaps they could still be allies for us.
Kaladin Shash 02:17:37 Otherwise, I don't know. We need to investigate, and perhaps there is an opportunity to do something outside of the dome.
Zariel Torgan 02:17:51 Yeah I think you're absolutely right. I think we need to recognize that probably only the higher ups really know what's going on. Sure, Ratshit and Levi are probably just as in the dark as we are. Absolutely.
Leopold Magnus 02:18:10 Yeah, it's probably best to assume that they're still worthy companions, but we should certainly tread carefully like we've talked. I'm very curious about this specimen we dug up here. This is something quite puzzling. And I've got like an extending monocle lens zooming in on this suit of armor.
Dungeon Master 02:18:31 Ha ha.
Leopold Magnus 02:18:36 And I make, I don't know, an investigation check. What I want to do is I want to extract the power source from the suit and then maybe also kind of try to study it a little bit to see if I can glean some information. So I don't know if that'll be like a number of consecutive checks, something I could just do every time we have a long rest or whatever.
Zariel Torgan 02:18:36 That's it.
Dungeon Master 02:19:02 Yeah, we'll start off with just like an intelligence check to start with.
Leopold Magnus 02:19:06 Okay. So just a straight intelligence check. Ah, off to a good start. Natural one.
Dungeon Master 02:19:17 Natural one. Um, I think it's the I think it's better. This came from a natural one and not a high roll. You are sort of like working in this body, you're taking out things that are like are for sure unnecessary. But then you get to like around one of the like, what you've identified as like one of the isolated cores. And you go to like,
Zariel Torgan 02:19:18 Heh.
Dungeon Master 02:19:38 tinker with it try to pry it out just to sort of get a sense of it and as soon as you get close to it it hits you with like a really abrupt zap and you take I don't know like five points of shock damage as it like almost sort of like is protected from tampering and you were just electrocuted by trying to do that.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:00 Yeah, so that electricity kind of reverberates through me and gets conducted off of the, uh, Witchbolt antenna that is kind of on the back of my armor. And, uh, yeah. And Kaladin and Zariel's hair starts to stand up on edge. And I'll turn and I'll say, Hmm, tamper proof mechanism on this thing. It's going to be a little bit more difficult to figure out than I initially thought.
Dungeon Master 02:20:09 Like a Jacob's ladder goes up the top. You guys can tell that if you touch a Leopold right now, you're getting shot. You can tell by looking at Leopold that if you touch him, you're getting shot.
Zariel Torgan 02:20:12 Got to be in. That's funny.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:30 What's that? Oh, yeah. I'll spin around and I'll say, Zario, hand me that wrench, please.
Dungeon Master 02:20:39 He's like a live wire.
Zariel Torgan 02:20:42 Must be an Apple product, they don't want you messing with it. Alright, just be careful alright. I don't want you getting zapped. Alright, I'll just take a big step back.
Kaladin Shash 02:20:44 Yep.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:58 Yeah, I think that's wise. I don't know what this thing is, but I think I could probably crack it.
Dungeon Master 02:21:17 OK. Anything else for tonight? I guess this would. Be really important to get out above table. You had originally described it the symbol on your back.
Leopold Magnus 02:21:23 No, I was just curious about the... Does it say bone crusher, or is it just the gauntlet crushing bones? Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:21:24 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:21:45 With the symbol on your back, I think you had said that it says bone pressure over the top. So I would say this is an exact copy. It is essentially like a house crest that is printed on your guys' like it's engraved in. So it would also say bone pressure.
Leopold Magnus 02:21:52 I think it, I think I did. Okay. So yeah, it's, it's pretty evident that maybe that is like a house or some faction or something.
Kaladin Shash 02:22:13 Silence. Silence.
Dungeon Master 02:22:18 Something like that. Real hard to say.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:22 Or they just really like crushing bones. Interesting. So much lore tonight.
Leopold Magnus 02:22:29 Well, and that's interesting because the Steel Defender peels off of my back, and he has that emblem on his shoulders. A softer armor covers me when the Steel Defender's out. I don't know if that's any connection or not, but that's something, yeah, that's interesting, no doubt.
Dungeon Master 02:22:58 So much lore, guys. Justin, you sure you don't want to do something tonight? We can knock into you, too.
Leopold Magnus 02:23:01 Well, I'm all ears. I'm interested to hear. It'll always be captured later, so you can go back and look.
Kaladin Shash 02:23:01 on.
Zariel Torgan 02:23:07 I think we're at capacity right now. There's so much shit going on. Yeah, I mean, I'm cool with whatever. I'm just... Zariel's just...
Zariel Torgan 02:23:29 I don't know, reeling from being in a fight for the first time without going down. Maybe recognizing that this is a strategy he should probably try to adopt. Yeah, I guess I didn't have to die this time. Maybe I could try that again. Yeah, it's like, I guess I could do this differently.
Dungeon Master 02:23:34 Realizing that you don't have to die is really funny.
Kaladin Shash 02:23:39 Don't go down. Okay. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:23:58 Yeah, I was going to say, I don't think I have identified. But if I did, could I use that to look at the magic that the suit is held together by? Would that give me anything interesting? Or would that be kind of a waste? OK, interesting. Yeah, OK. Yeah, that was pretty fun. That was a big session.
Dungeon Master 02:24:11 You could try. You know that Identify lets you know School of Magic and stuff, so it would be at least a little helpful for sure. Yeah, we can call it there. That's good. Well, you guys would for sure get your long rest.
Kaladin Shash 02:24:28 Dude.
Leopold Magnus 02:24:33 I mean, I'm happy. It's up to you guys.
Zariel Torgan 02:24:36 Hey, did we nail down? Oh, go ahead, sorry. I was just going to ask, because I thought we were done, if we had nailed down a tentative in-person game. But if we're doing more in-game stuff, I can wait till we're actually done done.
Dungeon Master 02:24:42 Oh, go ahead. Well, what are you going to say? It'll be important. It'll be real quick. You guys get your long rest in, so do that. And then somebody give me, because it sounds like the plan was backtrack to the river that it sort of ejected you.
Kaladin Shash 02:25:12 Yeah. Oh, we're gonna have a combat. We're gonna have a combat.
Dungeon Master 02:25:12 Give me one more encounter check and then I'll just determine if we start next session with a comment. Will set the same next time will do everything next time, but yeah, that's not good.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:21 I think it's me, so I'll roll it. That's not what I was hoping to see there. Well, at least we got a long rest. It's going to be an adult white dragon.
Leopold Magnus 02:25:34 That is a natural one. That's really not good. We're in for a big fight, that's for sure. We're going to need it. Yeah, yeah, that's great.
Dungeon Master 02:25:50 I can do so much with that role too, I guess I have a whole week to decide. OK, yeah, so she was. Well done, good fights. That was a good balance. I like that that was like a good encounter and then a lot of story stuff came out too.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:58 A second Froghemoth. Yeah, that was.
Leopold Magnus 02:26:11 Yeah, that was pretty sweet. It was dense. It was a good session, yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:26:23 But anyway.

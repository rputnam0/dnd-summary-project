Dungeon Master 00:00:00 Great, folks. Alrighty. As you all, the Odears, crept through the spider-ness towards the center of the sort of thigh that you were traveling in,
Kaladen Shash 00:00:02 Mm hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:03 There it is.
Dungeon Master 00:00:23 You made quick pace with your alternating companions turning into wolf spiders to travel along the web with perfect vision and sense of where everything is. As you got towards the center, they had a sort of mental link established by some mysterious, feminine-esque voice.
Dungeon Master 00:00:49 Curious at first, warning next, and then wanting a meeting lastly, just through these brief conversations as you made your way towards the center. Eventually, you got to a density of spiders that you couldn't avoid them. They were all around you, completely encompassing some entire walls of the tunnel as you came through before you came into the
Leopold Magnus 00:01:09 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:01:15 A very large pit and descending out of the darkness of this funnel web pit that kind of goes off into nothingness. An enormous spider descended its legs bigger in circumference than your bodies as it kind of silently moved in the darkness, sort of brushing the wind against your face.
Dungeon Master 00:01:40 and eventually it lowered down to a point where you could see it had one large marble black eye surrounded by the other spider eyes on its face, and when you came in contact with that, you felt as though all of your magic ceased. In a telepathic link, it continued to talk with you, saying it had been a long time since it met any who seemed as powerful as you, and it offered you a
Dungeon Master 00:02:09 a trade a chance for a great challenge as it had been a long time since this creature had had a good fight if you lost she would enjoy devouring your flesh and gaining your power if you beat her you would be rewarded greatly but first she wanted to see if you were worthy so you were given each 18 seconds to demonstrate how powerful you could be um
Dungeon Master 00:02:37 And with one of the party members, Zariel, doing over 175 points of damage, you just broke the threshold in gaining that audience. And the large spider form descended again, having sort of gone up to watch the exhibition. And in its sort of center carapace, it split open and coming out
Dungeon Master 00:03:04 Beneath it, there was this much different form. I need this to move. It's not. You had seen a still very large but more drider-esque form, still maintaining the one eye with the other eyes around it, but it had this wicked black sword in one of its hands, its monstrous spider lower body.
Dungeon Master 00:03:34 Um, and as you guys sit here again in this large space, it's like pretty open underneath you. You guys are on this little platform. You see instantaneously all these little spiders connect and mesh and they weave this spider web below your feet of a floor. And you guys have this sort of arena that you can stand on. It doesn't look
Dungeon Master 00:03:58 The strongest ever, like you could definitely tear through it, but when you walk on it, you find that it holds your resistance really well. But in the silence of this moment, who would like to do what first?
Zariel Torgan 00:04:16 Do we get the feeling that we're, like, rolling initiative, or do we get the feeling, like, she's like, all right, and, like, stretching and getting ready to do our thing? I'm gonna cast Polymorph. And...
Cyrus Schwert 00:04:27 yeah that's a good question we're getting a free round
Dungeon Master 00:04:34 what do you think awesome
Kaladen Shash 00:04:40 Yeah, it's happening. It's happening.
Leopold Magnus 00:04:43 Yeah, it seems like we maybe have some time to prepare if we drink the potion. Not like instantaneous, right?
Zariel Torgan 00:04:48 Yeah, I'm going to stretch big and just point. And a bright green, it's like zebra stripes, but the stripes are neon green and like bright hot pink. And you've got like a big afro, like a Mr. T style, like that.
Cyrus Schwert 00:05:02 A Mr. T felt after on an 8. Perfect.
Kaladen Shash 00:05:16 Yes.
Dungeon Master 00:05:19 Why do you hate him so much? I have you. As soon as you cast Polymorph, everybody go enroll initiative.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:22 Yeah. Have you guys seen the Key and Peele sketch where he's like, Mr. T's like, don't make fun of people's hair! Don't make fun of people's names! It's really good. They're like, we should do drugs, and he doesn't come out and say anything, and they're like, you've got dumb hair, and he's like, don't make fun of people's hair! Pretty good. Aww!
Dungeon Master 00:05:49 You get that off. Kaladin is now a giant ape, but that launches everything. I'm waiting. It's not coming through. Ooh, nice.
Kaladen Shash 00:05:58 Okay, welcome. I rolled initiative with eight numbers. That's great, 21.
Zariel Torgan 00:06:00 Oh, look at that. Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Cyrus Schwert 00:06:02 Look at us.
Leopold Magnus 00:06:14 Not bad. You guys are speedy. Cyrus and I are like over there picking our nose. Yeah, that's pretty high.
Dungeon Master 00:06:26 No, it's not. To start this off, initial count 21, Zariel, you were the first to polymorph. This is basically just a continuation of your movement. How do you want to kick this off?
Kaladen Shash 00:06:32 Those aren't bad numbers.
Cyrus Schwert 00:06:36 Those are good ones.
Zariel Torgan 00:06:37 Yeah, that's good. Yeah, so. So so that's my action. So bonus action. Well, first of all.
Dungeon Master 00:06:50 You see, you can tell in this instantaneous moment, she is sort of lunging. It is definitely the start of the fight. Know that you have an action. You got that off before initiative. It is now your turn. You have your turn.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:07 I would like to... Let's see... I'm going to move about 30 feet to the right. And then... Actually, you know what? I think I'm going to do something different. So...
Zariel Torgan 00:07:39 Let's touch. Ooh, that's a bummer. Um... Okay. Oh, sorry. That's not a good spell. Um... God, I didn't expect to have the action. Sorry. Um... Uh... I'm gonna do...
Dungeon Master 00:08:06 got him ripping over himself. You fool.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:10 Is that Fergie? Okay, just making sure.
Cyrus Schwert 00:08:11 Yeah, I think so.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:27 Yeah, I'm just gonna do... Jesus, I'm sorry. I really don't have any damage. Oh, I'll just bonus action... No, you're good. I'm gonna bonus action Fire Elemental. I'm gonna use my movement to get up into space, and I'm gonna make an attack. I forgot that I can do it as a bonus, so we're good. So I will...
Dungeon Master 00:08:39 I need to start counting down. Yeah. Are you going along the floor or in the air? I like it.
Leopold Magnus 00:08:41 Are you going to turn into a? Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:59 I want to go in the air because I don't want to destroy the floor. If I can. I want to get up in the air and... Yeah. Yeah, it's crazy. Alright, so I want to get over there and I want to make my attacks. Let's see here.
Cyrus Schwert 00:09:09 They have a fly speed.
Dungeon Master 00:09:12 Yeah, it's like 90 feet or something.
Zariel Torgan 00:09:25 So she takes 1d10 regardless, but I get two attacks, so I'll roll here. Do I have enough movement to... I guess I can just look and see. Oh, yeah. I want to get around behind, up in the air, a little bit right above her. Oh. Well, then I'll just go right above. Okay, yeah, I just want to be right above. And then I'll do two attacks.
Dungeon Master 00:09:40 She's against the web. She's against the back. You'd have to get like, you'd have to clunt. Yeah, so you could fly above. That worked. 22 hits. Nat 1 fails.
Zariel Torgan 00:09:56 Not bad. 22 and... Oh, natural one. Okay, so one hits. Yeah. So it'll be... 13 fire damage, plus she takes a d10 of fire damage. Plus, I think...
Zariel Torgan 00:10:19 With my Embered Main, I think I can do an additional 1d6 of fire damage. Right? Or since I'm a Fire Elemental, does that just kind of... It's just too much fire. Alright, yeah, it says once per day when you Wild Shape into a Beast. Well, it's a Beast, so... Okay, it's on now. It'll just be... It's not a Beast. Yeah, that'll be it.
Dungeon Master 00:10:31 I don't know. Read it. Have all my details. Okay. 18 damage on that turn. Starting off strong. After your turn, she...
Dungeon Master 00:11:01 You don't know her name yet. I don't think you guys asked. Not directly. Gotta be. She will. What can she do as a legendary action?
Zariel Torgan 00:11:06 I think it's Itsy Bitsy.
Kaladen Shash 00:11:08 Nope.
Leopold Magnus 00:11:08 Mm-hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 00:11:11 What?
Dungeon Master 00:11:26 She will just take an attack with her sword. Pretty basic. You see as you kind of fly in above and you swipe at her and you just have this aura. She doesn't recoil as like, oh, this is a weakness, but she recoils at the fact that she's now getting burned and she swipes up with this sword. You take... Well, she'll roll to hit.
Cyrus Schwert 00:11:48 Yeah, that'll do it.
Dungeon Master 00:11:57 24 to hit. You take 17 points of slashing damage. Yes, your sword is magical.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:00 Yeah. Alright, is this magical? Damn it. Okay. Alright. Okie dokie. Alrighty.
Dungeon Master 00:12:30 It was just a legendary action. After that, beautiful. Cletus is up. What do you guys want Cletus to do for his first round? Cletus sort of straves up
Zariel Torgan 00:12:32 All right, I saved. Yeah, get party started.
Cyrus Schwert 00:12:45 Move out there and moonbeam, baby. Come on. I don't know. What would Cletus do?
Leopold Magnus 00:12:47 Yeah. Get that motherfucking moon beam going. Cletus, get in there.
Dungeon Master 00:12:58 He's going to stay on the safe stone platform, but he just gets to where he can see this spider demon thing. And he will do a fifth level moonbeam as 120 foot range. And it's a con save of 16.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:15 Hot damn.
Dungeon Master 00:13:27 That was a good roll, though. That is 27. It still does half damage, though, so he'll do 35 points. Yeah, that was an insane roll. What kind of radiant damage? And then he will...
Leopold Magnus 00:13:30 Damn.
Cyrus Schwert 00:13:44 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:13:55 Bonus action. Does he have bonus action time? He'll Shillelagh. He'll turn his staff into a weapon just in case. And after that, it is Osiris.
Cyrus Schwert 00:14:15 Okay. I'm going to do kind of a buffing round. And I'll cast Freedom of Movement on my spell. And then I'm going to bardic who needs a bardic. I'm going to give...
Dungeon Master 00:14:29 That was a huge hit for me. Nice. Yeah. You can give a bardic to whoever you want.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:37 Nice. Nice.
Cyrus Schwert 00:14:49 Can I give a bardic to the ape? I smack Kaladin on the ass and it jiggles your afro hair a little bit and say, go get him, son. Ew. That's disgusting. I can't believe I just touched a baboon ass. It's greasy.
Kaladen Shash 00:14:58 Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:15:02 canon that this ape has like baboon ass, like bright red cheeks.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:12 Oh, God. DK up there. Oh, a little special sauce, huh?
Zariel Torgan 00:15:15 Yeah, it's very wet.
Cyrus Schwert 00:15:20 I'm going to try to walk in the business, run out into the business of one. Not necessarily next to her, but I'm going to walk on the webs. I think I'm going to do that, if that matters. Got it.
Dungeon Master 00:15:45 It is just a platform. OK. Beautiful. Up next is Leopold. But before that, nobody else got into range. So she'll just use another legendary action to take a swipe at Fire Elemental Zariel.
Cyrus Schwert 00:15:51 That's it then for me. That was action bonus action.
Dungeon Master 00:16:17 That is 19 to hit. 13 points of slashing damage. Leopold, your go.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:20 Yeah. Okay. Lower than 96? Yep.
Kaladen Shash 00:16:25 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:16:31 Well,
Leopold Magnus 00:16:37 Zaro, what are you at now? Your health is a lot lower than 96, right? Yeah, I was just looking at the combat log. Maybe it's not updated on my computer, but everyone's full health. I was just curious how much health you had. I was thinking about doing something. Oh, okay, so it doesn't impact. So I guess...
Zariel Torgan 00:16:57 Oh, I'm an elemental, so I've got like an extra 120. No, I'm good. I'm good. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:16:57 is
Cyrus Schwert 00:17:04 That's crazy number two.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:07 Right, right. Yeah, well, and so heroism allows people to get an extra five hit points of temporary health on their turn. Lasts for a minute. So if he was an elemental, he would still get that, right? Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:17:07 No, he's got two health rolls as a druid. Yeah, that would work. Yeah, because you're casting it on...
Dungeon Master 00:17:27 The person that is Zariel, and Zariel is just in an altered form, like casting it on Zariel still gets the magic too. So if you cast it to heroism, sorry, heroism on Zariel, it would still hold even if you dropped the form. It's not just going to go away. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:42 Yeah, that was what I was interested in. OK, excellent. I'll cast heroism, but I'll upcast it. And so it's when you cast a spell using slot second level or higher, you can get one additional creature. So I think maybe I'll do it at the third level. Yeah, third level. Which went one extra person or two? This is a first level spell, I think.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:42 It's just terrible. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:18:11 Does it say per level? Mm-hmm. Yes, two extra people. Three people total. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:18:14 Yeah, let me see. Yeah, so it is a first-level spell, and it says you cast this spell at second level or higher, you can target one additional creature for every slot above first level. So I guess it would be two extra, so it would be three people in total, yeah. So I will do Zariel, I'll do Kaladin...
Leopold Magnus 00:18:36 And let's see. I'll do Cletus right now. No, Cyrus. I'll do Cyrus. So you three will have five temporary hit points each turn regained. So if you lose damage, remember to replace those. Yep, exactly. So that should...
Cyrus Schwert 00:18:50 Okay. So I can have a higher max HP before
Kaladen Shash 00:18:54 Just to the top of our turn, we can just put like five hit points back on each round. Awesome. Temporary.
Dungeon Master 00:19:02 Is it temporary hit points or is it your hit point? Is it temporary hit points or hit points? Does it specify? So it doesn't go to your hit pool. Tip hit points is always separate. So you just have five. Once it burns through, you have zero. And then if you take more than that, whatever carries over goes into your normal health. But if you were to heal,
Leopold Magnus 00:19:06 What's that? No, they're temporary. So, yeah, if they take damage, then it's important. But otherwise...
Kaladen Shash 00:19:29 That's nice. Just eats a little bit of the damage. Pretty effective. Yeah, 30% reduction. Right, right, right.
Dungeon Master 00:19:32 With the 10 hit points, you don't heal out of your hit points. You just get five back. So it's just like a little shield that keeps coming back for you. Yeah. And it doesn't stack is the big thing, too. It's just five. If you already had five, you still just have five.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:41 Yep. Yeah, I mean, so potentially 15 damage around, yeah. Okay, so, oh, the other thing is you're imbued with bravery, and until a spell ends, you're immune to being frightened if that comes into play.
Kaladen Shash 00:20:06 That's great.
Zariel Torgan 00:20:08 Nice. Sweet.
Leopold Magnus 00:20:08 So I'll do that as an action. And then as a bonus action, I'll call out Bone Crusher. And I'll yell, get in there, Bone Crusher. Take the flank. And I'll send him out to flank with Zariel. Yeah. And that's my turn.
Dungeon Master 00:20:34 Good time. He goes after you, so I'll just put him at 15. And I already had him right next to you. He was just invisible. So where do you want him? Well, he couldn't get flanking because he can't get underneath and Zariel's on top. But if Zariel would go down the next turn, you guys could get... This creature just hasn't moved yet, so she hasn't come off of the wall.
Leopold Magnus 00:20:47 Oh, just flanking with Zariel. Right behind. Ah, okay, got it. Okay, yeah, yeah, that's totally fine. Then Bonecrusher will take a Force-Empowered Rend. Um...
Zariel Torgan 00:21:07 Is the moonbeam still up? Is there like a... Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:21:11 Go for it. Yes. It's directly on it.
Leopold Magnus 00:21:14 Which is, yep, plus nine to hit now. Let's see. 13. I think it is, yeah. I guess, yeah, where is that AOE with the moonbeam? That might be important. Okay, and he can't shape. Oh, five foot. Okay, cool. Pretty narrow. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:21:33 It's only a five foot. It's a cylinder. Isn't it five? How wide is it? Is it bigger than five? Isn't it just a space? Yeah, a space. It's going to be right on her.
Dungeon Master 00:21:41 13 minutes. Already already. After that it is
Leopold Magnus 00:21:44 Cool. Yeah, excellent. Yeah. 13 to hit. I don't think it would hit. Seems like that's a little low. Yep. So Bone Crusher will just post up ready to attack on next turn.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:45 I was gonna say, it's hitting like a knee.
Dungeon Master 00:22:10 Kaladin's big monkey ape but before that she'll use her last legendary action and she will just attack she'll just attack your bone crusher just because he's different that sounded bad yeah that didn't sound good that's only an 18 today 18
Zariel Torgan 00:22:26 That's no reason that I'm liking. The real monster is intolerance.
Leopold Magnus 00:22:28 I think he has... Was it an 18 you said? I think that is only 15. Let me see. Yeah, 15. So yeah, that hits.
Cyrus Schwert 00:22:36 We're the normal ones. You're weird. You're fucking weird, you big spider lady.
Dungeon Master 00:22:42 18 to hit? OK. That is 18 points of damage.
Kaladen Shash 00:22:42 You.
Leopold Magnus 00:22:56 Is he going to get one-shotted? Oh, no. Nice. Okay. So 18 points of damage.
Dungeon Master 00:23:08 Yes, sir. And then it is Kaladin's turn. Like a round of it. That's cool.
Kaladen Shash 00:23:14 Getting smacked on the ass. He's like... He's getting hyped. He's going to run, rope, walk, climb because he's an ape around the side of the corridor. Yeah. And in one hand, he had a rock. And before he arrives at that position, he's just going to launch one at the spider.
Cyrus Schwert 00:23:22 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:23:42 Go for it. 20 does hit.
Kaladen Shash 00:23:50 I think that hits a dirty 20. I think it was, I have to look at it. Is it 76? 76 plus six. 25.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:52 30, 20. Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:24:14 Nice. Almost 100 points dealt, guys. Bottom of initiative. It is finally her turn to go.
Kaladen Shash 00:24:23 It's great.
Leopold Magnus 00:24:27 Good round.
Dungeon Master 00:24:36 You see she is just hissing. These attacks are hard, but nothing harrowing to her yet. She'll continue stepping down. I'll read just real quick if Moonbeam acts at the top of its turn or not. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed and takes the damage on that constitution saving throw. To start her turn, she will do that.
Kaladen Shash 00:25:00 She's on fire. Yeah, she just lit.
Leopold Magnus 00:25:02 That's brutal.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:04 Additionally, if she doesn't use her turn to put herself out... Goddamn. Then, yeah, she would be... She would have to... Actually, I think she takes it on the start of her turn just being in proximity. And then, I don't know if she's flammable. But, I don't know, most...
Dungeon Master 00:25:08 The 30. It is not. It is not. Catch fire.
Dungeon Master 00:25:30 When a creature enters a spell's area for the first time or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in a ghostly flame that causes searing pain, and it must make a constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 at base. Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. A shape changer makes its saving throw at disadvantage. Yada, yada. On each turn after you cast a spell, you can use an action to move it. So it doesn't say anything about catching fire.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:36 Sorry, I might be confusing here. I was talking about me. Because I'm a fire...
Kaladen Shash 00:25:52 Well, nothing on being on fire. I like that even better. I like that way better.
Cyrus Schwert 00:25:57 I want to talk about me you want to talk about that that was worth fighting for let's go
Dungeon Master 00:26:02 Oh, your thing? Ooh, a clapback. Okay. Then go ahead and roll your damage thing, because she just takes it, right?
Zariel Torgan 00:26:05 Yeah, that was what I was trying to say. Yeah, sorry. Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah, she just takes it, and then, ooh, almost a nine. So one damage. And then, yeah, that was worth the ten-minute discussion. Yeah. Yep.
Leopold Magnus 00:26:07 Take that.
Kaladen Shash 00:26:27 I love it. It's a principle.
Cyrus Schwert 00:26:30 That's going to make the difference. It's going to.
Dungeon Master 00:26:31 It is the principal. Anyway, the moon beetle is half damage. Eleven more. Damn. Okay. She'll take the attack of opportunity from the fire elemental. And you see she's so big that she just kind of scuttles over the...
Zariel Torgan 00:26:39 Goddamn.
Kaladen Shash 00:26:59 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:27:00 Bonecrusher and kind of puts herself on the other side. And on her turn, she can... She'll use her Web of the Abyss ability. Um...
Dungeon Master 00:27:23 You see her sword, now that you get a better look at it, is like black, and it sort of drips with like this ichor, but it's kind of up in a sickly, kind of unforged way, almost scimitar-esque, but just like curvy and jagged, but it drips constantly with like this black ichor. But she takes a step back, and she sprays it out, and it spreads out like a web of just blackness, and it covers, it'll be...
Dungeon Master 00:27:50 I'm going to say the fire elemental is higher enough that it won't get it, but it is 30 foot cube next to her, which would get bone crusher and the ape. When you start your turn, you'll have to make a deck save. So nothing happens yet. But then she will take her attacks.
Cyrus Schwert 00:27:52 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 00:28:06 So save.
Kaladen Shash 00:28:06 We're looking for a certain save.
Dungeon Master 00:28:24 um we'll just do she does a bite and then two sword attacks so the bite will be against the ape and then bone crusher will get one attack and she'll go back to the ape so bone crusher has a it's a 27 to hit
Zariel Torgan 00:28:39 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:28:42 15 AC. Okay, but I will use Bonecrusher's reaction to deflect the attack. So this won't impact me, but it'll have disadvantage on Kaladin. Yeah, I think for all the attacks, right?
Dungeon Master 00:28:56 Okay, for the next one. Okay. That'll be 20 points of damage to Bone Crusher. And then she'll attack Kaladin with disadvantage. And that is...
Kaladen Shash 00:29:15 It's going to take a long time to bleed out in the flints.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:15 Actually, hold on that might not apply because if you did 20 points of damage bone crushers down So I can't deflect attack Okay, that works
Dungeon Master 00:29:23 I'll say he gets it off by putting himself in the way. The first swipe sort of takes out like one of his arms and his legs and he goes down on one side and then the next attack goes for the giant ape and he just kind of launches himself up and the bite sort of goes into his form instead. A 16 misses, doesn't it? On the giant ape.
Kaladen Shash 00:29:49 Well, three hits. It's not a great step. I'm okay. I can take a hit.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:52 Oh, cheers. Oh, or
Zariel Torgan 00:29:52 Don't you have that one-a-day shield you could use if you wanted to? It's not your wizard spell like your normal one. Yeah, I don't know. My intelligence might be too low. All right.
Cyrus Schwert 00:29:54 It's not good, Stacey. Can you use that as the eighth?
Dungeon Master 00:30:08 Okay. Bonecrusher gets swiped out of the way no matter what. And you take... That'll be 17 points of piercing damage. Give me a constitution saving throw. You do a 5. So it was just 12 points of damage instead.
Kaladen Shash 00:30:20 Yeah, yeah. I had it stacked on my temporary. That's where I'm putting the apes hit points right now. So it's managed. And you said a con?
Leopold Magnus 00:30:24 And remember those five temporary points. Nice.
Cyrus Schwert 00:30:28 All right.
Zariel Torgan 00:30:34 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:30:42 Perfect. Beautiful. Concept, yeah. The ape should be pretty good at it. Right. 20 fails.
Kaladen Shash 00:30:50 Plus 4. He's plus 4. I can't see it. It's hiding under a button. 6. Oh, 20. That's great. Derte 20.
Cyrus Schwert 00:31:00 That's true. If you want.
Leopold Magnus 00:31:04 20. 20 was your save. Yeah. Oh. Oh.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:08 Nice. Ugh! Wait, you have a... You have... You have... You're inspired. Yeah. It's a d8, isn't it? Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:31:15 And you take 16 points of poison damage. Okay. It's just 16 points of poison damage on top of it.
Kaladen Shash 00:31:22 My bardic. It's a d8. I'll save it for later play. Yeah, I want to hit on a hit, not just miss a 16. OK.
Cyrus Schwert 00:31:29 Use it on an attack call if you want to. Oof.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:37 That makes sense. Jesus fucking Christ.
Dungeon Master 00:31:43 And then you take one more sword attack. And that is a natural 20. Yeah. You take 31 points of blasting damage.
Leopold Magnus 00:31:52 Jesus Christ.
Kaladen Shash 00:31:53 The natural 20 certainly hits. That's okay. I'm sponging it. She's just hitting this sponge the whole round. It's okay, guys. Oh, man, 31. All right, so minus another 47. Here it comes.
Cyrus Schwert 00:32:04 That's the whole point.
Dungeon Master 00:32:15 And that ends her turn. Top of the wall on Fire Elemental Zaryon. I have temporary hit points. Perfect. Yeah? 25.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:21 Alright, so I'm going to move... I added it, so yeah. I'm going to go over here to flank. And then I'm going to take two more attacks with advantage. Advantage. That's going to be 25 on the first hit. And a...
Kaladen Shash 00:32:35 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:32:38 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:32:44 19 misses. Go for it.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:49 I can't see it's hiding. 19. Ah, okay. So 2d6 plus 3. And then being in my proximity for the first time is an additional d10. So that's another 2. So not great. We're looking at 11 damage.
Dungeon Master 00:33:20 Nicely done. And she is on fire still. I mean, yeah, she's a creature, right? Doesn't say anything about not being...
Zariel Torgan 00:33:23 And then... Okay, so she is flammable. Yeah, okay. Just making sure. And then... Can I... I didn't use all my movement. Can I...
Kaladen Shash 00:33:32 Yeah, keep preaching.
Cyrus Schwert 00:33:39 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:48 Can I move away from her 10 feet and move back 10 feet to see if being in my presence gives an additional D10 fire damage? Yeah. Okay, I just want to see if it works. Alright. It's going to hit because I think my AC is 13 as a fire elemental.
Dungeon Master 00:33:59 She'll take the attack of opportunity, but you can do that. Yeah. Let her make that attack. Well, that's a 21. Yeah, I say the one is possible. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:34:15 Don't know. You don't know. Here comes that one. One misses now. Yeah. One's a miss.
Zariel Torgan 00:34:19 but a one's a 15 right oh i guess a one misses no matter what okay that's fair and then i'll roll for that real quick um so do i get to do additional damage sweet
Cyrus Schwert 00:34:23 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:34:29 And that's 16 points of damage. Yeah, mechanically that checks out. What you notice is in order to get into flanking, you had to get close enough to the web. Anywhere your fire touches, you are burning a hole in the web and creating an opportunity to fall to your death. But you fly, so you over it doesn't matter.
Zariel Torgan 00:34:53 Gotcha. I just rolled... I just rolled two natural ones. Two. So the ape drops. Yeah, that's unfortunate. But we did it to get four damage, guys.
Dungeon Master 00:35:00 natural one.
Leopold Magnus 00:35:02 Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:35:03 That's tough. That's very tough. There goes our sponge. That's unfortunate. There goes the sponge. So it totally worked out. Four more damage. It's an easy trade.
Cyrus Schwert 00:35:07 That's crazy. That's pretty funny. That's awesome. Perfect. Really nice.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:22 So, all things considered, it's pretty worth it, if you think about it. Yes. Yeah, no-brainer, really. Um, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:35:35 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:35:37 That's great. Jesus, rolling hot tonight.
Dungeon Master 00:35:42 Four more damage. You got it, man. Okay. After that, legendary action. Gonna take a swipe at you. I forgot bone pressure's down, so. Nobody deserves anything. That's another 20. 20.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:52 Yeah, I deserve that. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, bring it. This is the shame that I've brought to the party. At all.
Cyrus Schwert 00:35:59 Oh, thanks. Go ahead. Jeez Louise.
Dungeon Master 00:36:14 You take 42 points of slashing damage. Yeah. I'm sorry. It feels uncomfortable. Does that put you down at all?
Leopold Magnus 00:36:15 You rolled a one. Yeah, I know. I know. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:36:19 I mean, that was a great roll. 28 on the die and then 14 more. You're rolling on the top end of everything right now, sir. Look at that. 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 1. Just one of them. Everything else was cops.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:29 Alright. Jesus. I'm doing okay. I got like 19 hit points left as an elemental. So.
Dungeon Master 00:36:45 Perfect, still up though. Okay, then it is Cletus. Cletus will use his action to move the moonbeam. So that'll be a con save. A natural 19, so he'll just take half damage. He'll just take half damage.
Leopold Magnus 00:37:07 Mm hmm.
Kaladen Shash 00:37:15 you
Dungeon Master 00:37:18 Another 11 points. Slow and steady. After that, it is Cyrus. What the fuck was up, Kyle?
Cyrus Schwert 00:37:32 All right. Cyrus is going to get all up in her business. What the fuck is up, Kyle? And I'll take a couple swings at her with my sword. Oh, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:37:33 And then.
Kaladen Shash 00:37:52 If Zariel is in the air, can Cyrus be flanking with me? Oh, because he was close enough, even though he was flying, that he burned a hole? Correct.
Dungeon Master 00:38:03 He could, but there is a hole there now. Yeah. Because he had to get into flanking for the advantage, so he got low enough to burn a hole, and then he moved up, but he couldn't go directly under him now because of that space. Absolutely.
Zariel Torgan 00:38:21 Oh, shit. Gotcha. Alright, I'll have to keep that in mind. Nice. Ooh!
Kaladen Shash 00:38:21 Roger that.
Cyrus Schwert 00:38:22 27 to hit on the first one. I'm going to take two attacks. Let's see. And a 28. And I'm going to do Divine Smite for the first time.
Leopold Magnus 00:38:42 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:38:42 He hit it. Damn, dude. Love it.
Cyrus Schwert 00:38:51 as well. So here we go. I wish these dice were combined. It's going to be a bunch of rolls in a row. We've got to add them all together.
Zariel Torgan 00:38:52 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 00:39:15 Nice. Max damage.
Cyrus Schwert 00:39:20 It takes so long for my computer to roll. So the first one was the attack. The second one was both of the bonuses. This is this, that attack. And then we'll do a fourth of smite boost for shit.
Dungeon Master 00:39:23 I think it would be easier if you just typed it out, you know, slash R space slash
Kaladen Shash 00:39:31 Gee, that's all right. Let it go slow. Uh-huh.
Cyrus Schwert 00:39:49 Probably. I'm not good at it. It always fucks up and then I have to do it anyway. 22, 31, 57. Let's go. And that'll do it for me, Chief.
Dungeon Master 00:39:51 Blank D, blank plus 6D, blank plus whatever. 26. OK, so that's 8. 9 is 57.
Leopold Magnus 00:40:10 Nice.
Kaladen Shash 00:40:10 That's not bad.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:14 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 00:40:20 Nicely done. Okay, after your turn, I'm going to use another legendary action, but as you've entered the fray, and that was a huge hit. I mean, how does the Divine Smite manifest from Cyrus for the first time? What is his spin on it?
Cyrus Schwert 00:40:40 Oh, fuck. Shit. My choker and the peace sign on my sword that are the same light up like a Care Bear stare. And it's like a big old pop of light from the sword as I hit on that. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:40:41 you
Dungeon Master 00:40:58 Red chip is magic! Beautiful. That pisses her off. You see she swings down so hard with her sword. It almost feels personal. Almost a 2, but that's a 32 with a natural 18. I'm rolling POTS.
Cyrus Schwert 00:41:28 That'll do it. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:29 Worm's gonna turn.
Dungeon Master 00:41:30 18 points of slashing damage. After that, it is Leopold.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:42 Awesome. Leopold is going to run up and actually take the flank with Cyrus. Oh, wait, that's Cletus. Chill out. Take the flank there with Cletus. And with my action, I'll take two slashing strikes with the searing saber. And we'll see how this goes.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:59 Advantage.
Dungeon Master 00:42:05 Go for it. Misses, unfortunately. 24 hit. So the first one is... First one to 24. Second one is...
Leopold Magnus 00:42:12 Oh, Christ's sake. 12 on one of the attacks. And then a 24 on the second one. Oh, shit. Okay. No, I didn't. So I guess it would be a 24. Let me roll the second one. Good looking out. Oh, well.
Cyrus Schwert 00:42:19 I see.
Kaladen Shash 00:42:23 Did you roll with advantage? One hit. Yep. Here you go.
Dungeon Master 00:42:37 This map excites me. Got a 21 hit. Both hit. Go ahead and roll your damage.
Leopold Magnus 00:42:42 One of them was a nat one, and then yeah, 21 on the other one. Okay, sweet. That's excellent. That advantage saved me a lot there. So, there's one, 12, and the second one, nine, and then each strike will deal an additional bit of fire damage.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:45 Nice. Nice. Nice.
Cyrus Schwert 00:42:51 Yep.
Leopold Magnus 00:43:11 seven points of fire damage on those two. And then for my bonus action, I will pull up the magic stones. And that's my turn.
Dungeon Master 00:43:18 Beautiful. Nice. Okay. That was one, two. This will be third. Third legendary action after you join. You see completely surrounded. Every time somebody strikes, her leg comes up. She goes down with the sword, getting almost feral at this point. She'll swipe down at you, Leopold, being the newest to join in.
Cyrus Schwert 00:43:25 She's fucking feral.
Dungeon Master 00:43:48 That was almost an 18, but that's a natural 2. That's a 16 to hit. Damn, I shouldn't have said something. Sword goes wide. You'd think that it would cut the web with how hard she hits, but the weird material of the sword passes through the floor below no issue if she pulls it up on the back. After that, it is Kaladin now in his elven form.
Leopold Magnus 00:43:52 Oof. Messes.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:54 First miss. Sorry.
Cyrus Schwert 00:43:59 What the hell?
Kaladen Shash 00:44:18 Why was it so short? No fun. I'm going to cast haste on myself. And as the hasted action, I will cast mirror image on myself.
Leopold Magnus 00:44:23 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:44:25 I hear that a lot.
Cyrus Schwert 00:44:32 Yes.
Dungeon Master 00:44:38 Okay. Nice. Okay. Nice. You are pasted and mirror imaged.
Kaladen Shash 00:44:54 Okay, now I'm ready. That's all I can do. And in our telepathic mind, I say, keep it up. Do more. Yeah, no, I'm right outside melee still, right?
Cyrus Schwert 00:45:08 Do more.
Dungeon Master 00:45:10 Don't move into the space, though. Perfect. Let me see. She might have a ten-foot reach. No, just five. Okay. You're not in range. You're good. But after your turn, is her turn proper? Yes.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:23 Well, she already used her reaction if you wanted to move. Hey. Real quick. Why is Kaladin going so late in the initiative? He rolled a 21. Oh.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:26 Oh, this round. That's okay. I don't need to move. My intention is to stay up close the rest of the fight, just keep the buffs I've got. Yeah. I just, it was just, it didn't update because I did a custom roll for the ape because I couldn't use my initiative number.
Dungeon Master 00:45:45 Did you want to use your initiative order? Right.
Cyrus Schwert 00:45:51 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:51 I said that out loud, but it was 13. It was fine. I was like, whatever. I'll play the order. Yeah. It doesn't matter. It's a turn. It's still in front of her. It wouldn't matter if I went before everyone else in the group or at the bottom of the group. So it's good.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:52 Gotcha. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:46:15 I'll say in your hasted magic, do you want to change your initiative order to what it should be? Yeah. Well, is yours 21? Perfect. What is your dex bonus compared to him? Compare length here.
Cyrus Schwert 00:46:20 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:46:22 Oh, yeah, I'll take a back-to-back play, essentially, yeah. You can move me up. It was 21, just like Zariel, yeah. I think it's five. It's five. It's plus five.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:39 Mine's plus two. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:46:47 Okay, Calvin, I'll put him at 22 just so he's at the top of the round where he should be. Okay, though, on her turn proper, looking pretty hurt. You see wear and tear on the body. She's getting frantic. What you guys have noticed is you're not encapsulated in that non-magical space like you had felt before. Focused on combat, it doesn't seem to be affecting you right now.
Cyrus Schwert 00:46:59 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:47:16 But she will take her 3 attack, the bite, and 2 claws. At the start of her turn, she takes 6d10 damage. 5d10. Oh, she can make the con save. Let's see if she passes for the moonbeam. That's... Yes, okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:47:26 She also takes five fire damage. Being on fire, she never put herself out, so at the start of her turn.
Cyrus Schwert 00:47:32 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:47:47 Five fire damage from what? So much damage. 25 shall take the pass. Hmm. Okay. So we'll roll this. That'll be 5d10. Halved is... Damn. So it'll be 15 plus this...
Cyrus Schwert 00:48:03 Wow.
Zariel Torgan 00:48:10 Damn.
Dungeon Master 00:48:17 15 plus 12, 27 points of damage. She will, I think, pissed at the fire elemental being a continued nuisance, will take... She'll take all three attacks on you. Getting desperate.
Zariel Torgan 00:48:43 Now I use my once per day shield. Alright, then I have an AC of 18.
Cyrus Schwert 00:48:46 Whoa.
Dungeon Master 00:48:50 It was a 17 to hit, natural three. Yeah. Beautiful.
Dungeon Master 00:49:06 deflects off the butt when she goes to bite she is humanoid looking her mouth expands and it's almost just like an illusion melts away as like these fangs on top and bottom come out they like snatch at you you have the mental uh like telepathic link forced on you as she's just repeatedly saying that she wants to feed but hits your shield and buffers off she backs off and she'll take two wipes at you
Zariel Torgan 00:49:33 Hey, hey. I'm at one fleamy hit point. I'm still standing.
Dungeon Master 00:49:33 That's a 21 and a 17. Second one misses. Natural three. You take 18 points of slashing damage. Effective use of your round. Nicely done. She will not move.
Kaladen Shash 00:49:51 Still up. Touch him, touch him.
Dungeon Master 00:50:03 Okay. Up at the top of the run, Kaladin. How much more damage does she have? Only hit you once, so she'll take 1d10. 18.
Leopold Magnus 00:50:08 Wait, doesn't she take damage for attacking Zariel? Or did you sort that out?
Cyrus Schwert 00:50:10 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:50:14 Oh, he's right. It's 1d10 every time I get hit. Yeah, so it's 1d10, so I'll roll it real quick. Ooh! That's double what I got for dropping that spell. That was really awesome.
Dungeon Master 00:50:36 Okay. Calvin. I assume you're selecting your spell.
Kaladen Shash 00:50:49 Uh, I will start my turn by casting fireball third level. I'll sculpt the hell out of it. Yeah. I don't want to, I don't want to burn the web or allies. So yeah, no, no issue there. It's, it's one of my better AOEs right now. It's still third level. It'll, it'll get better as I get a little bigger. Um,
Leopold Magnus 00:50:55 You're gonna fuck us up.
Dungeon Master 00:51:03 This is the first big sculpt from Kaladin. How does it... Because this is, I imagine, going to be a huge form of damage.
Kaladen Shash 00:51:19 the the sculpt piece of it it's like everybody's bathed in like a lot of pressure as the explosion like expands outward but it's just like a warm blanket like a warm weighted blanket everyone got swaddled in bright light just feels nice yep
Dungeon Master 00:51:35 and question when you read fireball does it's not fireball sculpt does it specify that you can sculpt only around living beings allies or can you sculpt anything
Kaladen Shash 00:51:49 Allies. I can't sculpt anything. I think it's just allies. Because all flammable objects will always catch. I can also ensure that the bead hits the top of the spider or high enough in the air for an explosion point. Right? But it still misses the web. Yeah. Hole. That's okay. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:51:56 Afternoon.
Dungeon Master 00:52:09 You would have to do that, otherwise you're going to burn a huge hole in the arena. Everybody would start falling. You got it.
Kaladen Shash 00:52:18 We'll keep it high, and if I need to sculpt at least Zariel's one point, I'll do that. He's flying. No, you're gold. Yeah, don't sweat it. We're just looking for a deck save here.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:26 I think I'm immune to fire damage.
Cyrus Schwert 00:52:31 you you
Dungeon Master 00:52:41 Deck save will be a 14, but she will use her first Legendary Resistance to succeed. 25 down to 13.
Kaladen Shash 00:52:54 It's okay, burn those up. No damage. And then that was my hasted action. With my regular action, I'm gonna move forward and take two attacks. Yeah, fine. Now this be,
Zariel Torgan 00:52:56 Absolutely.
Dungeon Master 00:53:15 I'll go for it. I believe Zariel said he was floating in the air. So you couldn't get Flanking from missing.
Kaladen Shash 00:53:24 Would this be with advantage if I move in close enough just because it's already all floating away? Fair enough.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:32 Yeah. Actually, I haven't moved from when I burned that hole. Right? Well, I went up and I came back down because I did that really smart move that worked really well.
Dungeon Master 00:53:49 You did not go up in the air then, so you're still... Okay, so then, yeah, Cyrus would never have been able to get under you. Yeah. So, yes, you do have flanking, then.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:03 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:54:04 All right, good. There it goes. Personal hit, 25. Second attack, same thing. Let's just see what we get. Yeah, it hits 28.
Dungeon Master 00:54:21 25 hits. 28 hits.
Kaladen Shash 00:54:36 Oh, that's great. I'm going to reroll the twos that I got on the D6 and the D10.
Dungeon Master 00:54:58 Okay. 26. Nice. Ooh, healthy hit.
Kaladen Shash 00:55:14 Not bad. So that was 16. So 26 because 20 minus 4 is 26. No, that's all I got.
Dungeon Master 00:55:29 really really hurt but not dead anything else okay I know your turn she's going to use a legendary action to take a swipe at Zario fuck you man you put her on fire
Zariel Torgan 00:55:50 What gives? Oh yeah. I am back to myself, and I think that means I'm falling.
Dungeon Master 00:55:58 21 to hit. 18 points of slashing damage. You will fall on your turn, which is next.
Kaladen Shash 00:56:13 Right through the hole you had Wiley coyote over there.
Zariel Torgan 00:56:19 alright she takes 1d10 fire damage from hitting me 3 alright um let's see here hmm would you like to be an ape again Kaladin?
Dungeon Master 00:56:31 Okay, roll high. Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 00:56:51 I don't know. Are we going to need it? She's starting to get... Yeah, she's got a little burst. Yeah, you can... Question. Question. Would I be hasted as an eight?
Zariel Torgan 00:56:55 Something tells me that this is, like, her first form, and that she's gonna be like, oh, you, you know. Yeah. I see his smug little smile over there. Don't, don't you, don't you wiggle your fingers like you don't know, yeah. Yeah, as I, yeah. Who would imagine so? I don't think you lose concentration.
Leopold Magnus 00:56:59 Yeah. That's good.
Dungeon Master 00:57:04 What do you mean? More than one. Yes. Your concentration will fail.
Kaladen Shash 00:57:24 Yes. That's great. Yes, I will gladly be an ape. Let me hook two stones at a time. I can do three punches. That's 9d10.
Leopold Magnus 00:57:31 mm-hmm
Zariel Torgan 00:57:31 All right. All right. As I'm falling, I'm going to reach out and I'm going to make you into an ape, except for this time it's going to have the fur, but it's going to spell out you've got too many legs. You're black and then there's white lettering. Then a thumbs down right at the belly button.
Kaladen Shash 00:57:56 Just calling her out. Those bonus hours that action.
Dungeon Master 00:58:02 you fall 60 feet on your turn you fall 60 feet on your turn so you are falling while you're doing stuff nice
Zariel Torgan 00:58:03 Yeah. Well, hang on, wait a minute, my friend, my turn's not over, is it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, I know, I know. Bonus action, I would like to turn back into a Fire Elemental, because I can do that twice now.
Kaladen Shash 00:58:30 float back up.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:31 And I would like to move back up into space. And I accidentally made a bunch of elementals. Oh, you got it. Okay, you took care of it. Thank you. I would like to come floating back up through the hole that I fell. And take two punches. Hopefully with advantage. Because of flanking. Alright, so that's going to be an additional d10 for moving into my space for the first time.
Leopold Magnus 00:58:45 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:58:46 Yes, sir. Can you attack if you used your action to polymorph him? That's okay. You're forgiven. You're not falling, which is important.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:03 Nope, you're absolutely correct. You're 100% right. I apologize. So I will just move up and menacingly float. Yeah, there wasn't anything bad down there, was there? It's just like a cushion.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:20 it's like an old dusty mattress yeah
Dungeon Master 00:59:21 No, but she'll take that damage. You rolled four. So hurt. But after that, she'll use her legendary action because it's getting desperate. She'll just go for fire mantles looking healthy.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:29 She has a really dirty mattress. She's like, this probably isn't...
Dungeon Master 00:59:51 Leopold's healthy. Ape is healthy. Cyrus is not. She'll attack you, Cyrus. Oh, almost a 16, but an 8. That's a 22 to hit. Nice. 25.
Cyrus Schwert 00:59:59 Good fucking luck. Once a day shield? I go from 20 to whatever. I forget what the number is.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:10 Nice. Nice. 30. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:16 Plus five, yeah. Plus ten.
Kaladen Shash 01:00:16 Five more. Three.
Dungeon Master 01:00:18 The sword hits you and grinds against these glistening gemstone scales that buffer in space before dispelling. Good use. It is now Cletus' turn. He is concentrating, but since she didn't move, his moonbeam will still hit her. So he will cast... Does anybody need a heal?
Cyrus Schwert 01:00:49 I mean, I've heard a little, but not a lot. Yeah. I'll just save it.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:50 I mean, give it to us if you're going to use it.
Dungeon Master 01:00:56 Do you want him to save it? Okay. Then he will do just a guiding bolt then. But with a 13, he misses. Oh, yeah. And who has the...
Zariel Torgan 01:01:00 Yeah, wait till somebody dies. Respectable.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:15 Oh, I was going to say, Cyrus could have guaranteed a smite on a crit or just a hit. Oh, it's too bad I tried to use that almonds part early. I ate it when we were doing the trial. Or pulled the effect.
Dungeon Master 01:01:25 Oh yeah, the almond was used. After Cletus, that'll be one and two. This will be her last legendary action. Miss the crap out of Cyrus. We'll just attack the giant ape. Nineteen to hit.
Cyrus Schwert 01:01:26 didn't have it at the end of last time. That was so fast. I think
Zariel Torgan 01:01:48 Oh yeah, you've got plus AC now too. Wow. Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:55 Is that me? AC right now is 21. Oh, I'm sorry, with the ape. No, no, no. I'm hasted, but I've got, it'll be 14 for the ape right now, so it still hits. Okay. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:01:58 Yeah, you. Misses. Uh... Hello? How's it going? You take 16 points of flashing damage to your baboon-ass form. And then it is Cyrus' turn.
Cyrus Schwert 01:02:14 Hi Jonathan. I am gonna fucking kill this thing and just attack it with my sword two more times. Sorry I didn't say hi to you Jesse. Hi Jesse.
Dungeon Master 01:02:35 Go for it.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:36 Nice. Got advantage still. Hi, how's it going? Thank you. It's coming up.
Cyrus Schwert 01:02:44 Oh, dude. Oh, it's good. Congrats on the wedding. Or soon to happen wedding. Exciting. Sorry to interrupt. Your case is white. Okay. I think they're wrong. It's not the other one.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:59 Oh. Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:03:04 Yeah, we should talk about that at some point. 19 hits. Oh, 19 misses.
Cyrus Schwert 01:03:15 We'll attack again, then. My other attack. 22? Nice. Then I'm gonna fucking smite again, because why wouldn't I?
Zariel Torgan 01:03:18 Oh. Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:03:34 22, it's
Leopold Magnus 01:03:37 Peace.
Cyrus Schwert 01:03:47 Another not one of that guy, but that's OK. Everything's fine, because I have another fourth level to find somewhere. Let's do it like this. So it's another 5d6. She's the least. 21.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:04 It's only a little under average, just a little. Definitely dead. Definitely the end.
Dungeon Master 01:04:16 21 points of damage. How do you want to finish her for now?
Cyrus Schwert 01:04:22 Could have been better. Oh. The for now takes away what I would have said, I think. I was gonna say, I try to, like, slice the ground that's been created underneath her so that she, like, falls in or something.
Kaladen Shash 01:04:31 Definitely did. It should still be epic.
Leopold Magnus 01:04:32 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:35 No chance. I have killed you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:04:54 Or is it like stone? I think of it as like webs. Her flavor, if she can leave the battlefield for a moment. Who knows? 35 feet. Can't be that deep. Yeah, eight miles.
Dungeon Master 01:04:57 It's a web. It's webbing. Yeah, you can do that. I like that. For a second, yeah. How far do you want her to fall? I'll give you some benefit to the kill. A reward. You...
Zariel Torgan 01:05:14 miles she falls long enough to give us the longest
Dungeon Master 01:05:22 sliced through and it cuts and the webbing splits from underneath luckily everybody in the area that would sort of get pulled down as the way the web gave away has got pretty good footing and she you like cut her through the chest and she almost bisects hanging on just by a little bit and she starts to fall letting out like this horrific scream like like the wraiths from lord of the rings piercing through the sky it's just like splitting your eardrums she falls 35 feet but then you see
Dungeon Master 01:05:50 As Zariel has suspected, she catches the webbing and her form stops as she braces herself. And then with another scream, very similar, you see a rushing of spiders onto her form and she starts eating them and consuming. And you see her wounds heal and she physically grows in size again.
Dungeon Master 01:06:12 And you see the eye on her face, the black huge one that's just a marble splits down the center almost like linear sort of pupil and it starts radiating a sick purple and green alternating hue as you feel all of your magical items as she is looking up at you lose their effect as you enter her anti-magic field. But she is 35 feet below you. And to start...
Dungeon Master 01:06:42 Next round will be Leopold. It's a 150-foot cone, so from her angles, fully encompassing. If she were to be level with you, it would be a pretty good sliver, but not all of it.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:47 Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. So let's see. She's just looking straight up. What's the cone? Is that known? There's nowhere in this.
Cyrus Schwert 01:06:47 Anti-magic, okay?
Zariel Torgan 01:06:51 Just a little comb. Or a rock adder.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:14 Okay, okay. So there's nowhere we can go to avoid the magic. Yeah, got it. Yes, I was concentrating on heroism.
Dungeon Master 01:07:20 Not currently. Is anybody concentrating on a spell? Currently, you can tell heroism is a spell. The tether isn't gone. But...
Zariel Torgan 01:07:34 Yeah, polymorph.
Kaladen Shash 01:07:34 Yeah, at least.
Dungeon Master 01:07:41 It is inactive right now. It's just not functioning. So while you're in this space, you don't get the benefits, but you feel that if you left this field of view somehow, that it would just reactivate. You're not losing concentration and losing a spell. It's just not active currently. Keeping in mind for any actions.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:01 Okay, okay, let me think about this. And the spider is is down below us, right? They're like 30 feet down. Oh, well, that's that's trippy.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:11 Oh, how'd you do that? Did you just make her...
Dungeon Master 01:08:16 smaller because she's farther down. Yeah. It's like down there. Well, I put the floor there, and then I took it away so you can see what the map actually looked like. That is .
Leopold Magnus 01:08:30 Yeah. Oh, shit. I've got nothing if I can't do anything magic.
Kaladen Shash 01:08:36 I'm joking.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:42 Did you make her smaller for perspective? That's too creative. I don't like it. Say something mean.
Dungeon Master 01:08:44 I made her 0.5 so that she got smaller.
Cyrus Schwert 01:08:57 If I only got you. I. I who have nothing. I.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:59 Let me let me see here. I think maybe Yeah, I think I have to do one one thing here. I was just looking for maybe something creative, but I can't find anything Tori. I'm gonna shoot my Yeah, but those are magic, right?
Zariel Torgan 01:09:12 You still hurt her feelings.
Kaladen Shash 01:09:22 Do you already imbue the stones? But they're already imbued. They're just a stone now. Does that mean... Wow. Okay. So you know it's already been... Oh, I didn't think about that. Okay. Roger that.
Dungeon Master 01:09:28 Yes, they are. They are currently innate. Everything magical is deactivated. Anything on your person that gives you a bonus, ring, ring of protection, cloaks, anything that is blocking you is no longer affecting you.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:35 Yeah, so I'm just going to do a good old crossbow hand bolt, which I haven't used in a while. 17 to hit.
Dungeon Master 01:10:03 17 misses. There is, I deleted it, but in theory, it just looks like a big circle with a slit in the middle.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:05 Okay. 12 to hit misses. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. So two missed hand bolts, and then I'm going to, I guess, well, there's a big hole in the floor here. What are we hanging on to? Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:07 All right, guys, she's just got one hit point in this one. We just got here once.
Kaladen Shash 01:10:11 Mm hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 01:10:16 Whoa. Holy shit.
Dungeon Master 01:10:33 It's just a filthy slit. So like Cyrus and the giant ape and you are standing on a web surface, but it is like open on the bottom so you can see where it falls down to.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:35 filthy slick. Okay. Oh, Jesus Christ. I don't have really anything else. I guess as a bonus action, I guess I'll just kind of stand my ground. Oh, yeah. I'll just stand my ground.
Kaladen Shash 01:10:42 So,
Leopold Magnus 01:11:05 That's it. That's my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:11:05 Okay. The end of your turn, it is the start of her true form, the Great Omniscient Eye. The second Great General of the Cursed Army starts climbing up slowly. As she does, she will move her eye to be in range of... I can't do it because there's no way to do a cone above. But it carves out an effect that Moonbeam would technically be inactive.
Dungeon Master 01:11:32 She's going to lower it so it hits Cletus, Cyrus, the Fire Elemental, but it'll not be able to hit the Giant Ape or Leopold. And she is going to do, you see her eye, there's a big one, but all the little ones around, one of them sort of lights up and she at random does a Paralyzing Ray. I need a Constitution saving throw from you.
Kaladen Shash 01:12:03 Oh, giant ape. Sorry, man. Right. Now she's attacking me.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:06 Who's it hitting? Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:12:08 The giant ape. Yeah, sorry. She moves it forward in her perspective, which means the giant ape who is directly above her would be the first one to not be in her anti-magic zone.
Kaladen Shash 01:12:34 Here it comes. It's going to be a fail. Eight paralyzed apes out of the picture. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:12:40 That is, the giant ape is paralyzed for one minute. You can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of your turns, but I want you to give me a D12 roll on a one you fall into the hole.
Cyrus Schwert 01:13:00 All right, Dan. Odds? One, two, three, four.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:02 That's fair. Good odds.
Dungeon Master 01:13:14 then you paralyze sort of fall. You're pretty close to the wall. You just kind of lean back into the webbing. That's a pretty high role. And you're just sort of caught in the web in your fur, but you're a little stabilized. You're not going to fall into the hole. To end that round, we're going to go to the top and initiative and take a quick breather. I'm going to go smoke a little bit, say hi to Hannah. Plan, don't plan. I'll take my earpiece out if you want to talk secret stuff.
Kaladen Shash 01:13:43 secrets that's a total bummer man I was looking forward to throwing two ranged attacks or fucking three punches with this thing that sucks all right I'm gonna pass I get to roll the con save right here after the break so it's gonna be amazing just you can look at it you can't move towards it and you have disadvantage
Zariel Torgan 01:13:43 Nice. Yeah. It's alright. You get to... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:13:44 Ooh, interesting. Guys, does anybody know if a frightened creature can look at the person that is frightening it?
Cyrus Schwert 01:13:49 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:14:11 You can't move towards it, but they could turn around and look at me. Okay, yeah. Interesting. Yeah, I'm just trying to... Well, yeah, I can. I have that ability, but I was trying to think if that would help us in this battle. But she could just look at me, and then she wouldn't be frightened anymore. But I guess if she...
Kaladen Shash 01:14:14 Yeah. Are you trying to get the cone off?
Zariel Torgan 01:14:19 You're trying to frighten her? I'm thinking... Yeah, technically.
Leopold Magnus 01:14:36 Wanted to attack somebody else in the party then they would have disadvantage. So that would actually be pretty pretty helpful, right? Like they can choose to look at me and dispel the frightened spell or they'd have to look over and Yeah, I don't know. I guess they just in their turn looking at me. That wouldn't really matter. I
Zariel Torgan 01:14:49 You know, if they were looking at you. Well. Yes, Fred.
Kaladen Shash 01:15:02 Yeah, I think the key here is going to just be when she comes back up to our level, we have to disperse. She can only stare at one or two. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:09 Oh, yeah. We're already set up pretty good for that. Just getting tighter would probably be good.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:18 Well, I think if she can get the cone off me, I'll try the spell Summon Eyepatch, and we'll just put that on her. I should fix it. I think the only thing...
Leopold Magnus 01:15:29 uh you know i love i actually love that idea does anybody have like some thick cloth we could maybe like team up and try to blind this creature you think that's that we could like legit try that like a grapple or something yes
Kaladen Shash 01:15:40 I don't, that's really tough. I don't, I don't know if cloth obscures this magical aura that blasts out of its eye. Yeah, this, this, okay. We, this,
Zariel Torgan 01:15:50 I was gonna say, this demigod, I don't think some cloth is gonna keep that eye from working, but I like the idea. The only thing keeping this thing from dominating the world is like, ah, this burlap sack. If only it wasn't on. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:15:57 Yeah, me too.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:58 Let's see. Hey, man. There's a reason it's sitting in this dungeon. Yeah, dude. It's brutal when you have something like that because it's D&D. Everything is magic. Yeah, that's how you kill Maharb. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:16:11 This fucking anti-magic cone has been our downfall before, gentlemen. Golly.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:20 Oh yeah, that's how I... That's how I murked your first character. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:29 Cause I, we just couldn't do anything. We were totally dead in the water. They just fucked us up. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. It was a, yeah. Tiny little like pathways, like,
Kaladen Shash 01:16:35 We were hard. And then we were, we were trying to navigate on these small like runways. So it wasn't just like you could get out of the way easily. Cause we were in that cave system. It was terrain. If we, if we had had better terrain, we had a chance, but we just, it was like just a bunch of just a hard situation.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:53 I think our best bet as far as secret planning is maybe we bribe Hannah to mess with Jonathan. Mess up his notes. I think that's our best bet here.
Cyrus Schwert 01:17:05 That sounds good.
Leopold Magnus 01:17:06 yeah I mean like honestly if maybe they're just looking at one person and it's only affecting one person in the party then the others can just fucking beat the shit out of it
Kaladen Shash 01:17:23 I mean, as long as I have a nape, I've got pretty strong melee capabilities. And I'm not relying on my magic, you know, plus one anything right now. I mean, when she stares at me, I just lose the hasted action. That's all that's really happening right now. Is this fourth round? This is third round. We're running through third round? Or is this fourth? Can you keep track of that?
Zariel Torgan 01:17:35 Yeah. That is the benefit of the ape. Since the haste? I think this is the... I don't even think we're at the start of the third round. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:17:51 Third round, eh?
Kaladen Shash 01:17:53 Yeah. We're top of the third. Actually, no, no, no. I hasted afterwards because I've only hasted for two rounds now. No, I haven't hasted for the full battle. You're right.
Cyrus Schwert 01:17:57 Bye-bye.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:04 Well, didn't you haste right when she came back up? Or right when I made you a... Oh, it was right when I made you... Yeah, I was gonna say, I don't think you've hasted for very long. Yeah, because it just happened. So you've still got like, what, like six or seven more rounds at least of haste. Yeah, eight. Yeah, yeah, so you're set.
Kaladen Shash 01:18:27 Eight. It's a minute. It's eight rounds. Exciting. Yeah. Yeah, that's good.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:37 So, of spells that I think Jonathan doesn't know that I have, I have Mass Cure Wounds, which is 60 feet, 3d8 plus 5 for everybody. I still have all my 5th level spells, so I can still give somebody Freedom of the Winds if everything goes badly. That's still an option.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:46 Oh.
Zariel Torgan 01:19:02 Um, for somebody that starts to get in a bad spot, they can still move around and stay alive. And then... Yeah. I don't have much other than that. This is my second, um, Wild Shape. So, we could also have, uh, Cletus Wild Shape into, uh, Sea Circle of the Moon as well.
Kaladen Shash 01:19:30 You know, that's a great question. I don't know. Yeah. He summons. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:19:31 Circle of the Shepherd. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:19:33 Oh, Circle of Shepard. That's right. I don't know. I think I get elementals because I took Circle of the Moon. I don't know that he gets them at level 10. But that's a really good hit point sponge character. If he ends up getting in trouble. And he should have two of those. Just something to consider. Because I don't think that's... I guess it's magic. But I don't know if it's the same kind of magic.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:04 It probably is. And that's how we kill her. Yeah, I don't think... Yeah. Wear this lead apron.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:14 Yeah, it'd be convenient if we could build a little wall so that Cletus could hide behind it out of sight. Just hide Cletus over in the corner while he's focusing on Moonbeam. Hang out over there, man. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:20:47 We all back. I hope so.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:51 You should watch yourself, because we got it all figured out. You're inspired, by the way, Callan.
Kaladen Shash 01:21:15 Oh, that's right. That's right. I got a D8. I'm going to use it on this one. Make it happen. I don't know where the bar was, but I only rolled a 14. It was pretty soft. Yeah. Oh, no, no, no. I rolled a 4. Sorry. It was 4. 4 plus 4. I got an 8. So the plus D8 wouldn't have mattered one bit. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:21 Well, how close were you to making the other first one to not get paralyzed at all? Oh. Ooh. Yeah, okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I wouldn't waste it on that. Okay. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:21:22 Yes, Steve.
Dungeon Master 01:21:51 Excuse me. I don't know if Rex is back, but Talon, you're up first. Go for it. Let's see it.
Kaladen Shash 01:22:03 Yeah, end of turn. I'll make a constitution saving throw, please. That's real soft again. I rolled a three. I will wait. That hurts.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:03 Let's see what we got. It's all right, we'll get you back.
Dungeon Master 01:22:25 I will not succeed. At the end of your turn, she'll use a legendary action. And while she is in her mythic form, she has extra things that she can do. She will do...
Zariel Torgan 01:22:49 Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:22:51 Web of the Abyss, she can recharge her Abyssal Weave and then use it. So she will throw up that black webby ichor that covers all of you. I forget what it does, because I only got to use it once. At the start of your turn, you use a dexterity saving throw. I forgot about it.
Kaladen Shash 01:23:00 black anchor web on me. Sounds exciting. Did some decent damage. There's another. Do I just roll my dexterity saving throw as I'm paralyzed? Or did I just fail that? Do you know what I mean? Yeah, figured. Yeah, what do you want to do?
Dungeon Master 01:23:23 No, you auto-fail those, but at Zariel's turn, at the start of your turn as the fire element, it'll give me a dexterity saving throw. This might not affect you. Can you be restrained? Then you're fine. It'll go on you in theory even if you fail and it just burns off.
Zariel Torgan 01:23:25 Ah, goddamn. You don't want that. No, not as a fire elemental. Yeah, you goddamn right. Taking some nasty smoke. Alright, um...
Kaladen Shash 01:23:31 Staring at him.
Dungeon Master 01:23:53 Alrighty, but it is your turn proper. Okay, so you're going 35 feet long.
Zariel Torgan 01:23:56 I'm going to move around, where is the... I guess I'm in kind of the best spot. I'll just hover directly above her, and come down right on top, and I'll make my two attacks. So she'll take... Oh, um...
Zariel Torgan 01:24:25 I can't hold my action and my movement, so if I wait, I can't do anything. Unless she comes into my space. So yeah, I'll move down. And I'll just go right above her enough to where I touch. And so I'll do the 1d10 fire damage. So 3 fire damage for getting there. And then 2 attacks. First one, 17, missed. Next one, 21. Ooh. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:24:32 Yes. 21 exactly. Sorry. 21 hits AC 20. You guys already got the exact before.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:57 Alright, and then, uh, I'm guessing being in her new form, shedding her skin, getting eaten, or eating bugs, she wasn't on fire, now she's on fire again? Because of this? Or... Oh. So, should she have taken another D10? Or... From the...
Kaladen Shash 01:25:12 Certainly.
Dungeon Master 01:25:13 She never showed up for him. She just was cut down, so she would have been on fire the whole time. She hasn't had her turn yet. Oh, you're right. Well, then go ahead and roll.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:28 Oh, I thought she had her turn after she fell and then came back up. Because he killed her, and then she dropped. I mean, if she had the fire go out, I mean, it's totally reasonable. I mean, she got swarmed by a bunch of others. Alright, well, she's burning then. So, let's give her another D10. This is what's going to kill her. Hey!
Dungeon Master 01:25:42 Mechanically, she doesn't ever change. That was all just description. So she's still on fire.
Kaladen Shash 01:25:58 Death by a fire, a thousand matches. You're doing something, man. I think you're up to 26 points on that passive hit. It's going. No, it's going. It's great.
Cyrus Schwert 01:25:59 Let's go.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:01 Yeah, just a thousand little cigarette burns. I was going to say, cumulative, it means something. It's just the battle has to take a while for it to matter.
Leopold Magnus 01:26:02 Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:26:20 After that, she will use another legendary action to do an eye ray. She'll do a random one, but aim it. I guess she hasn't been able to move the eye yet, so it's the only one she can still... Oh! Sorry, you're right on top of her. She can hit you with it. You're in her shit. I roll for it. Hold on.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:42 With what? Yeah, I should be the only one in her space. This is fire damage, right? When you roll a five? I am immune to being petrified.
Kaladen Shash 01:26:48 It's right. It's random. Spirit. Spirit. Spirit. Woo.
Dungeon Master 01:26:56 No, five is Petrification Ray. Give me a dexterity. Are you? Nice. What a clutch one. Yeah, I recounted. That's the one you got. Beautiful. Love that.
Leopold Magnus 01:27:01 Oh shit. Hell yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:08 I am I'm immune to being petrified or paralyzed or. Just. Oh yeah. Um?
Kaladen Shash 01:27:16 So just a ripped at him again. He just stares it off. Just like the anchor web. Wow.
Dungeon Master 01:27:25 Cletus, on his turn, is currently unmagical. What would you guys like him to do? Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:37 So this really isn't the time for it, but I'm just now putting together that he's a cow that makes almond milk. Has everybody got that except me? Because I just just now. OK, that's hilarious. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. OK. I'm not the smartest guy.
Cyrus Schwert 01:27:38 Yeah. I don't think we focused on it very much.
Kaladen Shash 01:27:47 yeah come on
Leopold Magnus 01:27:48 Yeah. Can he not move out of the anti-magic field with the sight lines, the spider ass? Hmm. Wow.
Dungeon Master 01:27:54 He milks almonds at home. He would have to get... He would have to action... He would have to action dash to get out of the field. So he couldn't cast a spell on him anymore.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:08 He could hold an action.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:18 Wouldn't Moonbeam be up soon? Oh, I see.
Dungeon Master 01:28:23 Yeah, but if he uses action to dash, he couldn't use his action to move the moonbeam out of the anti-magic field. Because as soon as it enters the space, it's dispelled. Okay. Mm-hmm.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:37 Oh, why don't we just have him hold his action in case she moves her eye line? Because she's going to move on her turn, and then he can either cast a spell or move the moonbeam, right? What do you guys think? Yeah, it's just a column.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:50 That was like a vertical line, no? Oh, so are they still in it? If he would move out?
Kaladen Shash 01:28:51 Hang on, quick question. The moonbeam previously wasn't even moved yet, right? Did he move it 35 feet down to her? Or is the moonbeam still... Right, but it doesn't have a vertical limit. Like, what's the spell say? 40 feet? 60 feet? Oh, the beam's 120 feet. So what I'm asking is...
Dungeon Master 01:29:04 It's a pillar 120 feet. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:29:11 I thought it was like 60 feet. So yeah, she might still be getting hit. Oh, that's a good point. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:29:20 Was the original placement 60 feet above and below? Because some part of the beam is still going to touch the spider no matter what. And it's only one space. It's only one space. I'll give you that. Right, right, right.
Dungeon Master 01:29:31 But the beam is dispelled when it enters the spider's vision. And since she's looking up, it hits her gaze. Yeah. So if she moves it, he could absolutely hit her in the ass with it, no problem.
Zariel Torgan 01:29:43 OK. So yeah, what do you guys think? Do you want to have him hold his action or do you want to try to have him do something else? OK. I like it.
Kaladen Shash 01:30:00 I think Hold Action, if she moves, climbs up, does something, then you can use the action to move the moonbeam. It's the easiest choice for damage.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:02 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:30:22 After that, it'll be Cyrus. Yes, they are. She has not moved out yet. She hasn't had a chance.
Cyrus Schwert 01:30:26 Smites and flourishes are magical, correct? This bitch is still in the hole, or she's out of the hole? Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:30:30 yeah 35 35 feet down in the hole untouchable hard round
Zariel Torgan 01:30:42 Yeah, I coughed. Yeah. I was on the phone in a phone tree.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:49 Yeah, that's tough.
Dungeon Master 01:30:53 Jesse, you're muted. Okay, I didn't know if you were saying something. It just really looked like you were speaking. You didn't. You didn't.
Cyrus Schwert 01:30:56 Professional radio host in the conference.
Kaladen Shash 01:31:00 wrong button ma'am that's super funny i thought she got the mute
Zariel Torgan 01:31:09 And the lady's like, one second. And she clicked a button. I heard her click it. And then she went, coughed a bunch and then clicked again. And she's like, I'm back. I was like, I didn't leave. I was like, are you okay? Yeah. Land on that dirty mattress.
Leopold Magnus 01:31:18 Jesus. Happens to the best of us. Oh. There's definitely a rusty, dusty mattress down there, so you're good.
Dungeon Master 01:31:27 Do you need some water? Okay. Just give me an acrobatics check just as you do it for Flourish. No, I mean, this whole goes into like an abyss. You haven't found the bottom.
Cyrus Schwert 01:31:32 I'm going to jump in the fucking hole. Great.
Kaladen Shash 01:31:37 Are they at the bottom of the hole? Did I miss that? Okay. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:31:43 Yeah, lots of springs.
Leopold Magnus 01:31:50 No, I think 35.
Dungeon Master 01:31:55 there's like a gentle green light that kind of comes up from somewhere sourceless. So you could fall an unknown amount of distance, but Cyrus is diving towards her frame in there. 14 is perfectly fine. As you come down and land on her, go ahead and roll your attack. And I'll say roll it with advantage because you're like, you're basically just plunging it in 28 hits. But what did you create? You know,
Zariel Torgan 01:32:16 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:32:22 Yeah, 28. So I imagine that hits. I'm pretty sure. Max on that one, plus a d6. And then I'm going to fucking smite her ass again. I don't care. I'm smite happy. I'm jumping straight into a hole and smacking the shit out of her.
Kaladen Shash 01:32:25 Not bad. Yeah, commit full commitment.
Dungeon Master 01:32:26 28. It does.
Cyrus Schwert 01:32:53 I'm going to fifth level my... I did d6s last time. It was supposed to be d8s. So it's 6d8s. Okay. So 40 damage total. So I'm pouring it into her.
Dungeon Master 01:32:59 Dang. Nicely done. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:33:00 Roll them right. Roll them right. Yeah. 40. Well done.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:03 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 01:33:03 Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:33:21 Right on to her. After your turn, she hadn't used her last one yet. She'll use her last legendary action to take a swipe. But if you have more, keep going. Yes, you can. Plus eight is nasty. You're going to be glad you had that.
Cyrus Schwert 01:33:29 Oh, can I defensive Flourish as well? So I'm going to defensive Flourish. I'm going to roll a d8. So I get a plus 8, 8 more damage, and a plus 8 to my AC until my next turn. That's gold.
Kaladen Shash 01:33:45 That's huge. That's huge.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:45 Nice. So I'm going to do this again.
Leopold Magnus 01:33:49 Damn, dude.
Dungeon Master 01:33:53 Good round. As that legendary action, but as she is in her mythic state, when she takes her swipe at you with her sword, she makes two attacks now instead of one. So she will take two attacks against you, Cyrus.
Dungeon Master 01:34:18 First one is a 17, which misses for sure. Second one is a, not the time to roll low, 23, which probably also misses. Just a poor showing. After that, it is Leopold.
Kaladen Shash 01:34:29 Me too. No.
Cyrus Schwert 01:34:29 It does this time. Okay, go.
Leopold Magnus 01:34:33 What does that put you at, Travis? Oh, okay. Interesting. Yeah, so having witnessed Cyrus dive off, attacking, and recognizing I'm never going to avoid this magic eye without being daring, I too am going to swan dive.
Leopold Magnus 01:34:55 and as I exit the sight line of this magic, anti-magic field, I'm going to activate my saber and take an attack. So you need an acrobatics check, is what you had him do? Okay, I hope I don't fuck this one up. Fourteen?
Dungeon Master 01:35:14 Yeah, go for it. Since everybody's going down to her level, I'm just going to put her back to number 6. 14 to hit. 14 misses. Oh, 14's good, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:35:30 No, no, no, 14 on the acrobatics check. Cool. All right, then to hit. First one, 28. Second one, 21. I think both of those hit. Nice, 14 max damage on that swing.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:46 Nice. Nice. Nice. Oh my god.
Dungeon Master 01:35:47 28 hits. 21 hit. 28, 31. 37 damage.
Leopold Magnus 01:35:59 Additional three fire damage. And then on the second swing, oh, dirty. Another max damage roll. And, oh, shit. 37 damage just swinging. Then with my bonus actions, I still have the stones up. They never dropped, right? They were just
Kaladen Shash 01:36:13 Yeah, there you go. Saber's feeling it.
Leopold Magnus 01:36:28 disabled from the anti-magic. Yeah, I'm going to do this. I'm going to fall, slice, and then just keep falling, because I'll fall 60 feet on my turn. So I'll just fall out of range where I don't take a disadvantage on the ranged attack.
Zariel Torgan 01:36:28 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:36:29 That is true. And you were on her back. As you leave her space, she will use her reactions to take a swipe at you.
Leopold Magnus 01:36:59 Okay, that's fine. Oh yeah, that hits. Sliced. What's the... I was concentrating. Oh yeah, go ahead.
Dungeon Master 01:37:06 That is a 32 to hit. 23 points of slashing damage. But you continue your turn as you fall. Ooh.
Kaladen Shash 01:37:10 Maybe. Ooh. Two off a max roll. Cool.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:22 I would like to use my once-a-day ability to absorb damage from somebody else through my curse ability. Can I do that? All right, yeah, so you don't take that damage. I'll take that damage. You see the fire just get a little dimmer.
Leopold Magnus 01:37:32 Oh shit. Okay. That's pretty powerful. Okay. Hell yeah. Thank you. Excellent. And then
Dungeon Master 01:37:37 If you can. Beautiful. Why you don't take that damage? So keep going.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:52 All right, you're good.
Leopold Magnus 01:37:58 With my bonus action, then I will throw a stone. Let's see. Fingers crossed. Ah, I don't think that hits. 18 to hit. Damn. And then that is my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:38:13 18 Mythos. Now, what check do you think would be fair for you to catch the web? Or do you just want to fall into the darkness? Okay, cool. So just kind of keep going.
Leopold Magnus 01:38:33 Well, at the beginning of my next turn, I could cast Rope Trick and get myself out of here. I guess if you think a check, I could do that, too. I don't know. I guess I could try that first, and then I could do the... Cool. That is an action, so I'd have to cast it. Yeah, I mean, if that's possible, if you're giving me a chance.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:44 What's the action economy on Broke Trick? Might be worth it to try to get yourself.
Dungeon Master 01:38:47 Nope. If you've got a plan, stick to it. Yeah. Worst case scenario, you still can do it next time. But yeah. Do you want to make like a dexterity or an athletics...
Cyrus Schwert 01:38:52 Do you want me to make the check?
Leopold Magnus 01:39:10 Yeah, I think that... Well, hold on. Those two are probably the same. Yeah, they're both plus twos, so unless I could convince you to do something that's not dexterity-based, then I got nothing else besides that. Um...
Dungeon Master 01:39:29 Do you have something that makes sense?
Kaladen Shash 01:39:32 you
Leopold Magnus 01:39:43 I could flip the all or nothing coin and I could maybe let's say that there's some rope in my bag and I could fiddle around with my crossbolt launcher and try to launch a kind of a grapple line into the wall.
Dungeon Master 01:40:06 Yeah. If you're going to do the grapple thing, you could make a... It would be like a tinkering check, which is dexterity plus proficiency. Like at the top of your page, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:16 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:40:24 OK, yeah, that makes sense. Where's the proficiency? Oh, plus 4. OK, so I guess that would be a plus 6. Yeah, OK. So this plus 4. So 17? Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:40:32 You're possible.
Dungeon Master 01:40:45 17. Your guys' proficiency bonus is plus 4 at level 10. Dang, that's crazy. That's higher than I remember. Great. 17 is good. As you're falling, you sort of do this all at once, so...
Zariel Torgan 01:40:50 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:41:02 You launch your stone as you're like pulling this stuff out the other hand, you tie it real quick and you shoot it and it sort of goes up through the webbing and it's caught on enough that you pull down and the webbing sort of catches you in a slow descent so you don't rip off. You would have fallen, I know Larry will say 20 feet. So from base level, you are now 55 feet below, but you are 20 feet below her.
Leopold Magnus 01:41:26 Okay, cool. I dig that.
Dungeon Master 01:41:32 The start of her turn. She's got Elemental on her. Cyrus on her. Giant Ape at the top. She is going to move her eye. She's going to focus her attention on Cyrus. And she'll... Well...
Kaladen Shash 01:41:45 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:42:02 My sword is engulfed in her still, kind of.
Dungeon Master 01:42:02 Jesse yeah Jesse you said you're like on top of her right you said just close enough to touch her she couldn't look at both Cyrus and you so she'll just keep her attention straight up so now it encompasses Kaladin as well so everybody and then I'm gonna do it it'll be 150 foot circle it's directly above you guys which definitely takes everything
Zariel Torgan 01:42:11 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:42:34 Yeah. Everybody's in the anti-magic field except Cyrus and Leopold, who's below it. But then she will take her attacks on you, Cyrus, since you're on her. She will do... Follow them. She'll do a bite and two sword attacks. First one is a 24.
Cyrus Schwert 01:42:48 I miss it. I still have the defensive floor shot.
Dungeon Master 01:43:07 Nice sword then. If I could roll, this would be going better for me now. 21, which misses. Second sword. Jesus Christ. 18 misses. Well, that is that. She takes a fire damage on her turn. She just takes a flat amount, right?
Zariel Torgan 01:43:21 No, it's a d10. I'll roll it. Six. Um...
Cyrus Schwert 01:43:24 I mean, I would imagine so.
Dungeon Master 01:43:42 Six, does Cyrus also take fire damage? Peace on Earth. We'll just do six. We'll say that's the trade for keeping fire damage up. He's currently out of the AoE, so he's got heroism up on you guys.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:49 Yeah, if we want to roll it that way, yeah. Do you want me to roll again for him or just take six? Okay. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:43:54 Rex, do I still have the five temp, like HP every round? Okay. Okay, so I only took one actual day. Right on.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:08 Yeah, you guys have that. That never dropped because Jesse took the hits for me.
Dungeon Master 01:44:15 Why is my screen so blurry? Well, then after that, it's up at the top. It's Cal. And that was a waste of a turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:24 Come on, big money. Come on. Come on. Not paralyzed.
Kaladen Shash 01:44:41 30, 20. Is that enough? No, no, no. That'll hit. That's for the con save paralyzed. Okay, sweet. Great. Okay, cool. That's my turn. I'm at least cognizant.
Dungeon Master 01:44:46 320 hits. Otis saved. Yeah. It was, uh, well, I won't tell you the DC just cause you passed it by a bunch. Um, you, you, you passed. Woo. After that legendary, I Ray, uh,
Cyrus Schwert 01:44:48 Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:45:14 She can't do it on where she's got the magic cone, so she'll hit Cyrus. It is a five. Cyrus, can you for some reason not be petrified? Okay. Can you give me a dexterity saving throw then?
Cyrus Schwert 01:45:33 I doubt it. Sure. Let's go rolling hot tonight.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:33 Uh, if he asks nicely. I don't think I can guide as a fire elemental. Hey! Woo! Mm-hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:45:43 guidance. Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:45:53 1960s. You were fine. Love it. After that would be Cletus. He's just gonna continue holding out. Keep the plan going. After that, Cyrus.
Cyrus Schwert 01:46:03 Oh, true.
Zariel Torgan 01:46:14 Wait, if the whole round went by and he didn't use it, can we have him, like, throw a stick or something? I mean, so that he does stuff. Yeah, at least have him say something. I mean, throw an almond at him. Let him know that, you know. Yeah, have Chip shoot him.
Kaladen Shash 01:46:20 Throw some nasty words that way. He'd never waste an almond on that. He'd never waste. Oh, Chip. What about Chip's almond gun? Is that thing ready yet? Can Chip shoot him? I don't think the gun's done yet.
Dungeon Master 01:46:23 And he doesn't have any ranged attack. I can't do a Cletus Accent. You guys can do that. It's not...
Cyrus Schwert 01:46:39 Hey, you big spider, fuck you. Something like that. Okay, so I'm still like...
Zariel Torgan 01:46:42 Drive-by. That gun's not magic. Ah. That was good.
Kaladen Shash 01:46:52 Get ahead of themselves.
Leopold Magnus 01:46:53 Definitely not. Yeah. I've been working on other stuff.
Dungeon Master 01:46:53 It's Cyrus's turn. You're like on her thorax, like out of the view of her.
Cyrus Schwert 01:47:08 All of, I'm on top of her, basically. Yeah. I'm just gonna stay on her and try to just jab her.
Dungeon Master 01:47:18 big anti-magic cone, but her legs come up and slash you. She's got the sword, but you're sword in, kind of braced down, avoiding the worst of it. Go for it, go for it.
Cyrus Schwert 01:47:38 From on top, I guess. She's a power bottom, clearly. Here comes one attack. Probably have to steer it on my phone. It's going to take way too long. A 15 and a 29. I imagine a 29 hits.
Dungeon Master 01:48:00 29 hits, 15 misses. Good thinking. Is that 48 instead of 58?
Cyrus Schwert 01:48:10 OK, I'm going to do another defensive flourish and a third level smite. So about a fourth and fifth. Classic. Well, it's five with the flourish, but yes, the smite is four. So this is all plus eight.
Dungeon Master 01:48:33 Yes. 27 plus 8, 35. 35, good damage.
Cyrus Schwert 01:48:41 So 35 damage, and my AC only lifts by one just for the round. And that's me. I'm just jabbing a spider, just flashing on a spider.
Dungeon Master 01:49:04 After that, she's going to do another ray on you. Just because you're the only one. Yeah, we did. Go ahead and go, too.
Kaladen Shash 01:49:04 Yes.
Cyrus Schwert 01:49:12 Sure. Yeah, my turn's done.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:13 Hey, did we pass me between Kaladin saving and going to Cletus? Okay. Okay, alright. Is there a way for me to get out from the eye? Like, can I go underneath the ape on the backside? Yeah, I just want to loop around.
Kaladen Shash 01:49:37 I'm still above you guys by 35 feet.
Dungeon Master 01:49:37 Yeah, you could go down below. Yeah, I mean, she's looking straight up with the big eyes. So anything directly below. So her body is fair game below her. And then you've got 20 feet between where her legs sort of latch on and where Leopold has fallen.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:42 loop around somewhere where she's not facing, and then make some attacks. Alright, I want to go directly underneath, and I want to try to...
Zariel Torgan 01:50:11 flank with Cyrus so I'll just I'll just I'll move it over here but know that I'm directly underneath and then yeah so do I get flanking okay then I will make my two attacks here Wow not good okay
Dungeon Master 01:50:18 Yeah, go for it. Yeah. Misses. 22 hits.
Cyrus Schwert 01:50:21 The reaction was so good.
Zariel Torgan 01:50:42 Alright, one of them hits. That was unimpressive. Holy Jesus. It's a good thing that we didn't miss my turn, because that's pivotal right there. That was pivotal.
Kaladen Shash 01:50:51 it's okay it's okay your your path flame will get her for more all right it's all right
Dungeon Master 01:50:52 Six points of damage. Nice, dude. Sorry. On the ray.
Cyrus Schwert 01:50:52 It goes, wow, not good. OK. Take a wild load, but it is going in theory.
Leopold Magnus 01:51:10 Every hit counts, man.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:12 You know. Nice. Nice. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:51:24 Ooh, nat 20. Let's go. I flex my muscles on the spider. Fuck you, spider. You fucking big bitch.
Dungeon Master 01:51:26 Oh, dude, you are fine. You resist the paralyzing ray. Nice. After that, it's Leopold. You were falling. Oh, you did. You are no longer falling.
Kaladen Shash 01:51:37 He's 20 feet underneath. Let's go restart him.
Leopold Magnus 01:51:43 So I stopped, didn't I catch myself? Cool. Awesome. Yeah, so I'm going to yell out to Cyrus and I'll really say, I'll say, oh, Cyrus, you're coming into your adventuring days. Keep it up.
Dungeon Master 01:51:51 You hit the webbing. This is where you sort of hit the side. You start your turn. It was 20 feet down. What would you like to do?
Cyrus Schwert 01:51:57 I'm a fucking adventurer, dude. This is so sick.
Leopold Magnus 01:52:16 You're shrugging off that stuff like it's nothing. And then I will, at the fourth level, do a catapult. Except this time you don't see Leopold bend at the hips and hinge, turning himself into a cannon. He's just straight as a pencil. And his head, his little head snaps back.
Dungeon Master 01:52:28 I love to hear that. Go for it. Is that a dex save or it's a hit?
Kaladen Shash 01:52:31 There you go. Like a Pez, your Pez dispenser. Yeah. Big body.
Cyrus Schwert 01:52:34 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:52:46 and out the neck portion. Yeah, exactly, like Lopez Dispenser. You just hear this. It's a dex save, 17. So we'll see. Yeah, plus 10 is huge, though. Damn, so dexterous. So dexterous. Yeah, that's going to miss.
Zariel Torgan 01:52:49 yeah like it does very cute
Dungeon Master 01:52:59 Plus 10. That's a natural 16. 26. Just crutches down. Rock goes right above. Gets stuck on the web on the ceiling. Anything else? Go for it.
Kaladen Shash 01:53:01 Big body. Wow, she's very, very, a lot of dexterity for a large creature. It's tough.
Cyrus Schwert 01:53:07 Thank you. Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:53:18 Let's see. And then for a bonus action, I will magic stone. Oh, tough. Natural one. Yeah. Yep. And with that, that is my action and bonus action. That's my turn.
Kaladen Shash 01:53:35 one
Dungeon Master 01:53:36 Misses again. Great. Go for it. Do you want to move at all or do you want to stay where you are?
Leopold Magnus 01:53:46 Well, I guess I'll kind of hug the wall. Maybe I can get better footing, if that matters. So, let's see. I'm going to kind of try to stay right underneath the spider. Oh. I'll just...
Cyrus Schwert 01:53:47 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:54:05 Do you want to physically get closer at all or do you want to stay 20 feet down? Because you can use your movement against climbing speed. Directly underneath it is technically the fire elemental is between, but you could shoot around.
Leopold Magnus 01:54:16 Okay, yeah. Let's see, because Cyrus is in line with me right now. I see, fire elemental, okay. Yeah, I will, I guess I'm trying to rotate some shapes in my mind here, but I'll go around, this is the fire elemental, and then flank it on the right side of the cave wall. Is that possible?
Cyrus Schwert 01:54:21 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:54:45 Well, so if it is above you directly, 20 feet between you and it, the fire elemental is in between you and it. And what is your normal movement speed? You've got 15 climb. So you can get into the fire elemental space, but that's it.
Leopold Magnus 01:54:47 Like, where is... Yeah. Mm-hmm. I think it's like 30 feet or something. Yeah, 30 feet. So I'd have 15 feet of movement. Oh, so I wouldn't even be able to close the distance. Um...
Cyrus Schwert 01:55:05 hey. Oh.
Leopold Magnus 01:55:15 Yeah, okay, I'll just close a little distance. I won't go into the fire elemental space, but I'll get kind of right up to it. And that's my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:55:24 As close as you can without getting hurt, you'll say you're like seven and a half-ish feet. You're just right outside of its face. At the start of its turn, I rolled an eight on the fire damage that it takes. So it takes the damage, and it will... Yeah, it sucks. It'll move up, actually. It'll take the attack of opportunity from the fire elemental, and it'll...
Zariel Torgan 01:55:34 Better than I've rolled the whole time.
Cyrus Schwert 01:55:42 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:55:53 I guess, carry Cyrus up the web back towards the surface, but it won't get all the way there. It'll go, it's got 50 feet, so it'll go about 25, just be right below the line. But that narrows the field. Sleetus will now be outside of the anti-magic field as well.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:04 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:56:11 That hits.
Dungeon Master 01:56:21 But then it'll take three attacks on you, Cyrus. It's a 24 to hit. Give me a constitution saving throw. 15 to me? Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:37 15 damage on the, yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:56:45 Oh, it doesn't matter. Nat 20. Yeah. Let's go. I got fucked up, though.
Dungeon Master 01:56:56 This is another natural 20. Okay, you take 18 points of piercing damage and half of 34, so you take 17 points of poison damage, and you are not paralyzed. The two sword attack. 25 to hit, and 19, which misses, correct?
Kaladen Shash 01:56:58 Get out of here.
Cyrus Schwert 01:57:22 19 misses, yeah. I'm a little fucked up. Now it's finally caught up to me.
Dungeon Master 01:57:25 Nice. So the 25 hits. You take 16 more slashing damage. At the start of the round, that is Kaladin as the giant ape. Mm-hmm. Just like 15 feet away, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:57:45 So in relation to where I'm currently at, it's like 15 feet below me. It climbed 20 feet up. Okay. And I'm in, it's still looking straight up. So I'm, or did it gaze some go? Okay. So I'm still in its beam. I'm going to climb down. Can I climb down so that I'm underneath it and have a flanking opportunity with Cyrus?
Dungeon Master 01:57:59 Yes. Yeah, you can do that.
Cyrus Schwert 01:58:14 Bye.
Kaladen Shash 01:58:17 I'm eight, man. My climb speed is the same as my move speed, and I'm hasty.
Dungeon Master 01:58:20 You just swing on the web because it's like she's like huddled underneath the floor of where you are. It's the ceiling for her. You grab the web and swing down, never leaving her reach, hitting the bottom of the web and you punch up on her. Go ahead and do your attacks.
Kaladen Shash 01:59:03 So, 19, what one of them would be. Does that hit? Okay. That's okay. I'm going to use the, yeah, I want to use the D8. I haven't used it yet. That's what I typed in. It's KH1, keypire 1. That's what I typed in. It wouldn't roll. But I was trying, I was trying.
Dungeon Master 01:59:09 19 mythes. Just barely. All you have to do to change it is do 2D20KH, which means keep higher, and that's how you roll advantage.
Zariel Torgan 01:59:19 Bye.
Kaladen Shash 01:59:33 This will be the second attack. I'll just say 2D20. Is it no spaces? Or is there a space there? Yeah, I got nothing there. And now it won't roll.
Dungeon Master 01:59:45 No spaces on anything. Crazy. That should work.
Cyrus Schwert 01:59:53 I always have trouble with it.
Kaladen Shash 02:00:02 Sorry, let me get back on there. 2D20. Maybe a 28 to hit? Yeah. Oh, sorry, 21, but hits.
Dungeon Master 02:00:24 Ooh. It'll be a 21, but hits. Definitely hits. Yeah. Yeah, a one. So you hit it. Two attacks then. Roll your damage, sir.
Kaladen Shash 02:00:31 And then for that 19, I'm going to roll a D8. That was the inspiration, just so I can hit on that one. I'm sure I don't. I just need to get a one or a two. Is that all that comes down to? Okay, a one. Got it. That's all I need. That's great. I'm going to roll my hit. What's that? No, because I already used it whenever we did the tryout.
Zariel Torgan 02:00:49 I was just going to ask if you were going to use the almond. Oh, gotcha. Gotcha.
Dungeon Master 02:00:56 That's already was used. Let's see it. 9 a.m. Let's go. Hit.
Kaladen Shash 02:01:01 I'm going to do my hasted action as one last punch. So this will be three punches, hopefully. Yeah, 17 plus 9. 26 to hit. Okay. That's 90, 10. Oh, I got disconnected there. Hang on.
Zariel Torgan 02:01:23 Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:01:28 We have big round. Go ahead and just roll one more D10 because I'll take fire damage on her turn anyway. So just give yourself a little bit extra.
Kaladen Shash 02:01:36 plus, what is it, six? Okay, yeah, plus six. So this would be plus 18 on the back end.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:03 Oh, that's fun. There's a lot of clatter there. It's soft for the rolls, though. That's all right. I did it, really? That's funny. Yeah, I guess so. I don't know why the number shown is red, though.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:06 Oh, nice. I think that's higher than average. I think average would be 68.
Dungeon Master 02:02:10 That made me disconnect. Yeah, I got disconnected right there.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:33 Usually, like, green's, like, real high. I thought red was, like, dipping below average. It's still a great... It's still fun. It's still great damage. 118 would have been the max. I mean, it's still better than average. Just holding on to the web. Just throwing haymakers. Roaring. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:36 Yeah. Yeah, that's kind of weird. Yeah, it's a good roll. 74 is fantastic. Yeah. Hanging off the iPhone.
Dungeon Master 02:02:49 Insane hits. Very nice. After your turn, you're going to get hit with a ray. And in fact, she can pick up to three creatures. Why did she get hit? She should be right there.
Dungeon Master 02:03:13 She can hit both Cyrus and you, because now there are more than one. In fact, she can hit Leopold too, because he's still under. What can she do? Choosing three targets, so she can't also get Zario. First one in order will just go, like I said, it'll be Paladin. Give me a Constitution saving throw.
Kaladen Shash 02:03:35 All right. Let me see my eight. Maybe. Maybe not. 18. Okay. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:03:59 18. You do succeed, so you'll take half damage on 8d8 necrotic. 34. You take 17 points of necrotic damage. Next one up, Cyrus. You take a 2. Ooh, this is a new one. Give me a dexterity saving throw.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:59 18th decent. Who? Thanks.
Kaladen Shash 02:04:07 go 17 so there's one random in there look at the roll
Zariel Torgan 02:04:28 It just actually makes you healthier, this one. Yeah, it's just like, you know, just a feel-good one. Nice. I don't say squirt.
Kaladen Shash 02:04:38 He's on fire. Let's get it. Let's get it. Still going strong. Those rays got nothing on him.
Leopold Magnus 02:04:39 That'd be pretty fun.
Cyrus Schwert 02:04:40 19. Ew. You tried to squirt me.
Dungeon Master 02:04:41 19. Nice. You see she throws out, like, these are all coming in at different eyes, and one of them squirts out, like, a spectral web that, like, becomes physical as it comes to hit you, but you still dodge it. Next one towards Leopold. Guys are crushing it right now. It's the same thing. Leopold, give me a dexterity saving throw. Oh, no, I reroll duplicates. Hold on. Sorry. Don't give me a dex save.
Dungeon Master 02:05:10 That is con safe. Much better for you. You take 42 points of necrotic damage. Oh, that was a good round. That was a good mythic action.
Leopold Magnus 02:05:13 Oh, thank God. Yeah, much better. But not when you're rolling natural one. Fuck. Big hit. Yikes.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:23 Ooh. Ooh.
Cyrus Schwert 02:05:25 Yikers.
Dungeon Master 02:05:40 Give me are you concentrating or is magic stone gone was that you did you already use your third one? Okay, it would be a DC 21 con safe Yeah, so you could hit it 17 drops
Leopold Magnus 02:05:44 Oh, well, a magic stone doesn't require concentration, but the heroism does, so that definitely drops. Or what would it be, I guess? What's the check? Okay, to keep the concentrating? Oh, yeah. It's empty.
Dungeon Master 02:06:09 Don't gain your temporary hit points anymore. Uh, Zariel, it is your turn. That was after Kaladin's turn. Kaladin beat the shit out of it. He did, you know, 74 points of damage, remember?
Leopold Magnus 02:06:13 Bummer. Hmm.
Zariel Torgan 02:06:18 Isn't it Kaladin first? Oh, oh, oh, yeah. Yeah, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Sorry, I'm looking at the combat thing, and it's all jacked up, and so it was throwing me off. Yeah, I think... I'm down way below, right? It moved up, and I'm still under.
Dungeon Master 02:06:43 Yeah, you are like 15 feet. You're not way down.
Zariel Torgan 02:06:47 okay I'll issue up on top of the web now okay so I wanna go
Dungeon Master 02:06:52 No, she's like in basically, if you're looking up in the corner of the ceiling, she's underneath the floor of where you were, but everybody has moved down. So directly below her is the giant ape on top of her body in between the roof and her is Cyrus and Leopold is below you. So there's nobody on the top anymore. We could disregarded it.
Zariel Torgan 02:07:16 kidney corner to the ape to give advantage. Oh. So I go up above like at an angle? Like that? Oh, gotcha. Is there any way that I could flank or is it just not doable in this position?
Dungeon Master 02:07:21 Apis below. She's in the roof, so you couldn't get above her from her position. As a fire elemental, you could go above the whole thing, go directly above her and burn a hole in the web.
Cyrus Schwert 02:07:34 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:07:46 Oh, she's still under. Yeah, okay, so I'll do that. I'll go right above. All right, so she'll take a d10 from entering my space or being in my space for the first time. And so I'll do that real quick. And then, yeah, real, real good. And then...
Dungeon Master 02:07:50 Cool. Yes, you can get advantage. And there's a hole. 18 misses.
Zariel Torgan 02:08:09 We'll do advantage on these. So we're looking at 18. Not quite good enough. And... Jesus fucking Christ. Yeah. So... Not looking great, but I'm gonna... I'm just gonna be like, ooh. You know. Hit me. And then that's it. That's all I got.
Dungeon Master 02:08:22 15 misses. You are above. So you're in the anti-magic field. But another mythic action. She's going to launch three more beams at everybody below. So in order.
Cyrus Schwert 02:08:22 I'm using all the good rules. Perfect.
Dungeon Master 02:08:49 We'll just hit Kaladin this time first. I'm going to go Kaladin, Cyrus, Leopold. A six. What's up? Okay. Nice.
Kaladen Shash 02:09:00 No, no. Oh, sorry. Oh, no, I was playing around with typing it in. You can't do any additions to it. If you just want advantage on D20s, it works. I was trying to put a four on it. That's why I have that custom all higher up.
Zariel Torgan 02:09:08 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:09:20 Give me a constitution saving throw. No, sorry. Give me a dexterity saving throw. No, first one is Kaladin.
Cyrus Schwert 02:09:30 Me?
Kaladen Shash 02:09:34 Yeah, I'm looking at my eight plus two. Ooh, it's going to be a lot harder to tell.
Dungeon Master 02:09:51 14. You take... Oh, it's fun for a while. 40 points...
Zariel Torgan 02:09:59 Hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 02:09:59 Holy shit.
Dungeon Master 02:10:04 of force damage as this is like the equivalent of a disintegrate from like a beholder stock um but this manifests as she's basically just muttering how hungry she is she looks at you with one of her eyes and it almost has like teeth in it that you can see and you feel like your life force hold away as she consumes a bit of you uh and then next will be
Dungeon Master 02:10:34 Leopold, you get a new car. How much does Leopold weigh? Because it matters.
Kaladen Shash 02:10:43 400 pounds. 400. What'd you say? I remember you saying this once. You're
Leopold Magnus 02:10:46 four oh geez a full plate suit of armor um let's see if i specified yeah so seven seven light feathers uh background oh yeah holy crap uh so 155 pounds or 455 pounds sorry
Zariel Torgan 02:10:49 A seven. There's a difference.
Cyrus Schwert 02:11:01 That's heavy. She's a fucking O-line man.
Kaladen Shash 02:11:15 Yeah, thick, thick. Ooh, yes.
Dungeon Master 02:11:19 Because you are over 300 pounds, you can give me a strength saving throw. DC 16. 17.
Leopold Magnus 02:11:20 No. Okay. Well, here goes nothing. Oh, fuck yeah, 17.
Cyrus Schwert 02:11:36 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:38 Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:11:38 You see one of these eyes looks at you. You can tell it's focusing, and you feel like this invisible force trying to compress your body and yank you off of the wall, but you resist. You're too heavy. You're too engaged. It can't get a good hold. Good avoid. After that, it is Cletus, who is no longer in the anti-magic cone because she's too high up, but...
Leopold Magnus 02:11:55 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 02:12:05 He can use his action to move the moonbeam, which would hit everybody. Or he can heal somebody. I think Cyrus needs to heal.
Cyrus Schwert 02:12:13 I think a heel for somebody would be nice I sure wouldn't mind a heel let's go
Kaladen Shash 02:12:19 Doesn't Cyrus need some health points? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:12:33 He will do a 5th level healing word. Which in the new rules, which is the spell he picked, it is 10d4 plus 4. You gain 31 hit points. They buffed it by a d4 per cast. So it just was so minuscule before, but now you get 2d4, which is great.
Kaladen Shash 02:12:49 So much stronger, just like it should be. That's rad.
Cyrus Schwert 02:12:50 Cool.
Dungeon Master 02:13:04 Uh, beautiful heal. Um, and that is what he'll do. Up next then is that was one, two, third legendary action. Uh, same three people are getting beams. Yeah. I mean, in theory I could target trace too, but I'm not going to do that.
Dungeon Master 02:13:29 Same order. Kaladin first. You got three. Give me a constitution save. 18 you save. You take half damage. You take 38 halved. You take that 19.
Kaladen Shash 02:13:41 18. Right. 30 not 19. Yep.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:43 Excellent.
Cyrus Schwert 02:13:46 It's gonna fucking squirt at me again, dude.
Dungeon Master 02:13:59 Necrotic damage. Cyrus, your ray is two. Give me a dexterity saving throw. As you get webbed on, he's going to squirt at you.
Kaladen Shash 02:14:15 Oh. Like you're yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:14:17 Get the fuck away from me. Shout out to the two crew. Is it like webs all over me? Is that the thing?
Dungeon Master 02:14:20 You are... On a failed save, the target speed is half for one minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Yeah, it's the slow spell, but it's...
Zariel Torgan 02:14:20 slow. You're slowed. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:14:48 Gotcha. Just play it with me. Oh my fucking god, he squirted on me. He actually hit me that time. That's your strong suit, right? 455 pounds runs a 4.9.
Dungeon Master 02:14:48 web themed and then Leopold you get the you get the bad one give me a dexterity saving throw natural 180
Zariel Torgan 02:14:50 You just. Squirted in icky goo. Nice. You needed that you need that bad.
Leopold Magnus 02:14:58 Ooh, dex throw. Dex saving. Yeah, I'm... Oh, fuck yeah. Feeling extra dexterous today. Really needed that. Really needed that. Yeah. Yeah, that really hit. Oh, Jesus.
Dungeon Master 02:15:17 You take 59 halved. You take 24 points. No, that'd be 29 points of force damage, and you are not turned to ash. As you see, huge portions of your armor are absorbed off of it. It only did you for 29.
Leopold Magnus 02:15:35 Yeah, that's great. Love that internage. Alright, that's a big hit. And I yell out to Saris, it's squirting at me too! As like my armor panels just disintegrate, oozing all over me.
Zariel Torgan 02:15:36 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:15:36 Yeah, only. This is so fucked up.
Dungeon Master 02:16:02 And then after that, then now it's Cyrus's turn proper. So you are not restrained or anything. Can't have your speed affected? Is that what it does?
Cyrus Schwert 02:16:11 I still have freedom to movement cast on myself. It's not a concentration spell. Movement is unaffected by difficult terrain and spells and other magical effects can't reduce speed or cause me to be paralyzed or restrained.
Dungeon Master 02:16:37 It just gooped on you and it didn't do anything. It just, like, onto your body and you just kind of, like, wipe it off. You're... You are on its back and it is up against the ceiling corner, like, up there. So you're, like, crammed in the webbing
Cyrus Schwert 02:16:41 Let's fucking go. It's an hour. Is it above me now? I got lost in the... Nasty. Sure. Sure.
Kaladen Shash 02:16:47 God damn it.
Dungeon Master 02:17:07 almost where you're going to get burned by the fire elemental that is directly above it. But you are technically flanking, so you do have advantage still. 22 hit.
Cyrus Schwert 02:17:12 Sure. Okay. I'm just going to jab in my little crevice with advantage. 22 to the first one on the suit. The second one, 29. Okay. And I mean, I'm just burning every single thing I got. I'm going to
Zariel Torgan 02:17:32 Nice.
Cyrus Schwert 02:17:44 Do another third level smite. I'm going to roll that. This is plus eight. So 31. And then I'll use my last bardic to flourish one more time. This is separate. So plus two to my AC and two more damage. So 33 damage total.
Dungeon Master 02:17:57 going that wear and tear again she's not looking healthy by any means getting more frantic her mouth sort of just chitters as you're doing all this damage like she is like going through withdrawal symptoms losing all of this life force
Dungeon Master 02:18:25 She already used all three of her legendary actions, so it is just Leopold's turn. Nothing happens in between. It was force damage.
Leopold Magnus 02:18:33 Oh, that's good to hear. Um, cause I, I can't, I can't take anything else. Um, let's see. Oh, Jonathan, just for clarification, was that damage of a certain type? Is it just for just force damage? Okay. Um, which isn't an element that can be absorbed, right? Just
Zariel Torgan 02:18:35 Heh heh. Heh heh heh.
Cyrus Schwert 02:18:37 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:19:00 No, it does not, unfortunately. No, she's technically one of her eyes can see you, but she is looking up with her magic.
Kaladen Shash 02:19:00 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:19:01 Yeah, that's what I thought. Okay. At any rate, I am going to do a... Let's see, do I have any... All of my higher level spells are saves. Okay, yeah. I will just... And she's not looking at me, correct? Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:19:15 you you
Leopold Magnus 02:19:32 Excellent, even better. Then I will do... I'll do a Ray of Frost. Cast that out. Off. A low roll. 13 to hit. Okay. And then for a bonus action, I'll bring in the Magic Stones. Because I think I may have used them all.
Dungeon Master 02:19:42 Nice. What is that? 13 misses. 955. Yes, you did. I was hoping to put concentration back. Oh, it's not concentration. Never mind.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:01 Yeah. Yeah. Yep. And so that was my action bonus action. And then I guess in relation, so she's looking up, how many people could she look at? If she looked down at us, it would be all three. Okay. I mean, could I crawl underneath her?
Dungeon Master 02:20:20 She couldn't see Cyrus because Cyrus is on her back, but she could see the rest of you. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:20:21 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:33 How large of a creature is this? Hmm. Right behind it.
Dungeon Master 02:20:36 In theory, if you think of it like a spider on your wall, her legs are sideways into the webbing and her head is partially looking up and the rest are looking down at you guys. So you couldn't get underneath her. You're currently just down 15 feet in line with her.
Leopold Magnus 02:21:02 Okay. Yeah, okay. Just hang on to the back of the spider. Okay. And then, yeah, that's my turn.
Dungeon Master 02:21:03 You can get above her. You can get where Cyrus is. Yeah, you climb the web up around her and then onto her back. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:21:31 At the end of your turn, smart move, she will focus her anti-magic cone directly downward, hitting Kaladin, Zariel, but no longer Leopold. But she will take her three attacks on, we'll just say the giant ape, because you are a big threat.
Zariel Torgan 02:21:59 So I'm directly above her, though, right? Yeah, I should be right here. I got moved because I think it's easier to see the map. But yeah, I'm still above. I'm going to give her her fire damage. Oh, gotcha, okay.
Dungeon Master 02:22:04 Oh, right. You were above, so you're not affected. Yeah. You're not affected. You're fine. I'll just put you right here. So just the one... We added on to Kaladin's damage at the beginning. Just to make it a bigger hit.
Dungeon Master 02:22:33 Beyond that, though. Giant 8. That is a natural 20 on the bite. Oh. Ignore the d4. That was the wrong thing. That was a 26 on the sword. And a dirty 30 on the second attack.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:40 Nice.
Kaladen Shash 02:22:41 That works. That hits. That absolutely hits. And roll that damage.
Dungeon Master 02:22:59 for the bite that's normally 3d8 plus 7 give me a con save because it's 5d12 poison which would be double to 10d12 I'm going to wait to roll just for the d12 to see how many I actually roll
Cyrus Schwert 02:23:05 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:23:15 That's a dirty 20 on the con save. I've got this. Let's go.
Zariel Torgan 02:23:16 Too much damage.
Dungeon Master 02:23:28 20, 16, so you'll take half, so you'll just take 5v12. So it'll be 68 plus 5v12 plus 14. You take 57 points of damage.
Cyrus Schwert 02:23:36 Yes.
Kaladen Shash 02:23:43 Give me one more round as Nate. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:24:04 And you are not paralyzed because you passed. That'll just be the end of her turn. She is cornered. Start of the round. Giant Ape, Kaladin. He's on top. So you are below. And then it goes Spider.
Kaladen Shash 02:24:14 Yeah, so in relation to everyone else, Leopold's directly underneath. Is that where you currently move to? Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:24:23 I'm on top with Cyrus. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:24:30 Cyrus and Leopold. In theory, the fire elemental would have to be burning them, but we're going to let it go for now. Zariel directly on top of it. And then Cletus off on the side, out of danger. Mm-hmm.
Kaladen Shash 02:24:45 okay all right well that's fine i'm gonna climb up so i might just add its side because it was staring straight down at me right okay so i'm just going to climb up to its side because i can't get flanking any other way because everybody's vertically above and i'll take yeah i can get out of the field so i'll take my three melee attacks my punches
Dungeon Master 02:25:05 You got it, but you can get out of the field. Go for it. I don't think you'll kill her, but I think you'll get her really close. 20. Who hit? 20 is the AC.
Cyrus Schwert 02:25:17 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:25:19 That's okay. Let's just see. Have a little fun. The first one's pretty good. 22 to hit. Okay. Second one. That's why it's taking so long. 21. That hits.
Dungeon Master 02:25:47 It happened. 21 hits. 26 hits. Roll that damage. Music to my ears. 64.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:47 Nice. Nice. Come on big money. Nice. Jesus. One above average.
Kaladen Shash 02:25:49 Third one. Let's see, it's hitting 26. All right, so here we go. That's 9d10 plus 18. OK, that's better. That's better.
Cyrus Schwert 02:25:51 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:22 Oh, no, it's well above average. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:26:22 That's good. Heavy lifting in the last two rounds there. Still paid off. Yeah, 40. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:26:27 Hey.
Dungeon Master 02:26:34 So hurt, but not dead at the end of your turn. Okay. At the end of your turn, she's got to do legendary action to I beams at the only people not in the, well, there's three not in it now. So she'll hit again in order, Caledon, Cyrus, Leopold. We're hoping for one that don't do damage.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:57 Hey, I'm pretty... Yeah, I'm available for the hitting, too. Yeah. Damn it.
Dungeon Master 02:27:04 Oh, you are above it. Now I'm going to stick with it. I'm here to kill you. First one is a Paralyzing Ray on Kaladin. Give me a con save. Second one is a reroll the same one. Cyrus, give me a Dexterity saving throw. And Leopold...
Cyrus Schwert 02:27:10 the,
Dungeon Master 02:27:35 Can you be petrified as the Warforged? Okay, but it doesn't say anything against it. Okay, give me a dexterity save as well. Okay. So yeah, dexterity save.
Leopold Magnus 02:27:39 I don't really see why not. I guess, like, where would it say that? Oh, I have resistance to poison, disease, and magical sleep. So I don't... Yeah. Oh, fuck yeah. That's two for two on needing to come through.
Kaladen Shash 02:27:47 Statues are statues. Yeah. Whew.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:05 Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:28:06 Not 20. You are not petrified. Kaladin, did you get that? 18 also succeeds. Cyrus, what did you get?
Kaladen Shash 02:28:19 18. I don't know what the save was. Just pointing at it. Yeah. There we go.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:36 It's trying. Natural 20. Nice. OK, good.
Dungeon Master 02:28:41 Oh, it's in that 20. So he'll take half. That was the good one to save on. 44 half, you take 22 points of necrotic damage, of force damage. Oh, you don't take damage. Yours was a paralyzing ray. So succeeding is fine.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:59 Did you, Jonathan, did you say what my damage was? Did I miss that? Oh, okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:29:08 Sorry, I was muted.
Dungeon Master 02:29:14 Okay, I think this is where you guys can potentially do it. Zariel, it is your turn.
Zariel Torgan 02:29:21 Alright, I'm going to take a risk that there's not some sort of third skin to this nesting doll spider. And I'm going to drop my elemental form and I'm going to cast Blight. So that's going to be a con save 17.
Leopold Magnus 02:29:27 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 02:29:47 Roll that attack. OK, it'll be half damage no matter what, because if she fails, she'll do a legendary save, resistance. Con save, though, just if she saves it. That is a 29, so she saves. So 35 is 15, 17.
Cyrus Schwert 02:29:49 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:30:02 Oh, okay. So that's 35. Oh, wow. That's good. That's 17, yeah. And then... Bonus action... Oh, I can't... I can't cast a spell as a bonus action, can I? Because I just cast a spell. So never mind.
Dungeon Master 02:30:19 Okay. No. Okay. At the end of your turn,
Cyrus Schwert 02:30:25 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:30:31 Alright, and then do I have any other stuff I can do as a bonus action? Uhm? That's all I can do, OK? And I will wait. Gotcha.
Dungeon Master 02:30:48 It'll do another Ray, but it'll do, in order, Zariel, Cyrus, Kaladin. Zariel, you get a Paralyzing Ray. Give me a con save. Cyrus, you get a 1, 2, 3. How much does Cyrus weigh?
Zariel Torgan 02:31:07 All right.
Cyrus Schwert 02:31:07 probably like 140 times gaunt
Dungeon Master 02:31:23 Okay. We'll get to that in a second. Kaladin, give me a dexterity saving throw. 20. You are not petrified. Zariel, the con save. What did I roll on that one? First one was a 1.
Kaladen Shash 02:31:38 There it goes.
Leopold Magnus 02:31:40 Nice. That's what you need.
Zariel Torgan 02:31:47 I failed Okay
Dungeon Master 02:31:53 You are paralyzed. And Cyrus, sort of up in the top, protecting yourself, you feel the pressure sort of wrap your arms to your chest as you feel that you are grabbed by invisible force and you are thrown 30 feet in one direction and she is going to pick directly down the hole.
Cyrus Schwert 02:32:14 Perfect. What do we want Cletus to do?
Leopold Magnus 02:32:17 that was a good one to be a 455 pounds for yeah yeah
Zariel Torgan 02:32:24 He he he he.
Kaladen Shash 02:32:27 You'd be over 300 even to be able to resist. Yeah. But yeah, everybody else in the party would have gotten blown away. Yeah, kill Leopold. He's at 16.
Dungeon Master 02:32:28 And then yeah, Cletus is up. What do you want Cletus to do? He can heal again.
Cyrus Schwert 02:32:43 Leopold seems fucked. We probably should heal Leopold.
Leopold Magnus 02:32:51 You know, I can hang in there. 8d4. Oh, you're wrong. 32 points. That's enough for one more hit, if I take it. Yep. Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:32:52 Okay, he can't do as much. He can do a 4th level, so you can do 8d4 plus 4. So he'll hit you with that. You gain... Oh, they're on top of each other. They're not. It's stuck in the corner of the screen. 32 points of healing to you. That is significant.
Kaladen Shash 02:32:58 It'll eventually take its best guess. That's great.
Dungeon Master 02:33:21 After that is the last legendary action. I'm going to pick the three lowest. It'll be Leopold, Cyrus, and I'm not going to do Cletus. I said I wouldn't. Zariel, in that order. So Leopold first this time. Give me a dexterity saving throw.
Leopold Magnus 02:33:39 All right. It's killing me. One of these is going to be bad. 18.
Cyrus Schwert 02:33:45 It has been me.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:49 Nice. Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:33:54 Okay. Who was second? Was it Kaladin? No, Kaladin's high in hit points. It was Dyrus. Give me... This one can't affect you. This is the web ring. Last one is a four.
Cyrus Schwert 02:34:18 Fuck your webs, dude. Squirt me all you want, bitch. I'm not going to do anything.
Leopold Magnus 02:34:21 This is.
Zariel Torgan 02:34:26 That's me. I mean, I imagine Leo and I are relatively comparable. I think he's a bit bigger than I am, though. I am one pound. I am
Dungeon Master 02:34:26 And that goes to Zariel. Four is telekinetic ray. How much does Zariel weigh? I would say warforged. So this is where you get to decide it. You want to be over 300. Give me a strength saving throw.
Kaladen Shash 02:34:46 Yeah, you can be over 300, 301. 301, 301 pounds. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:34:55 Two pounds. Yeah, I'm very lightweight. You say strength saving throw? That's a plus one. 16. That's good because I'm paralyzed. Oh, no.
Leopold Magnus 02:34:56 Just made out of carbon fiber. Nice. Yeah. As he goes flying.
Dungeon Master 02:35:03 Yeah. 16 succeeds exactly. You are not thrown down the dark final web. Leopold, you save.
Kaladen Shash 02:35:17 Woo.
Cyrus Schwert 02:35:19 Consider yourself lucky.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:22 Wait a minute, I'm paralyzed. Can I even save against that? Or... It's automatic, isn't it? Like, strength is... Oh, I guess that's fair. I guess if I'm, like, gripped... I guess there's a way to make it work. You know? I'll take the win.
Leopold Magnus 02:35:27 That wouldn't be a fail.
Dungeon Master 02:35:29 It's a strength save. It's not a deck save. So this is just your ability to resist. So maybe like your hand is grasping on the web enough that she can't pull you free. I'm doing you a favor here because I might just kill Leopold right now. We're going to see.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:50 I will take the win.
Leopold Magnus 02:35:57 I didn't I didn't pass it. Yeah. Oh, half damage is still a lot. Yeah, that's true. See, what can I do? 20. Okay. All right. That's not terrible.
Dungeon Master 02:36:01 You did, but half damage might still be enough. OK. You take 22 points of force damage. And you are not disintegrated.
Cyrus Schwert 02:36:06 Thank you. Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:36:06 Might be a wallet. All right, you're good. Oh, that's intense.
Leopold Magnus 02:36:30 Yeah, I love not being disintegrated. So it's so much better than being disintegrated.
Zariel Torgan 02:36:30 Good. He would know. Get him.
Dungeon Master 02:36:40 Cyrus, it is your turn. You are 30 feet. You are 30 feet and you will fall 60 feet in a round. So unless you change your thing, you'll be 90 feet from the group. Mm-hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 02:36:41 So I'm falling down the well. Let's see what I can do here. I'm falling down the middle.
Dungeon Master 02:37:10 You've been removed from the equation.
Cyrus Schwert 02:37:16 Can I cast Gust of Wind on one of the walls or on myself to try to push me into the wall like the web to try to catch it?
Dungeon Master 02:37:36 You can do it either direction. I love that. And you can do that to start your turn. So you are 30 feet away. Do you want to push yourself backwards in line so you'll be directly below it? Or do you want to push the wall behind you and go forward to be sort of out from it? Oh my god, no.
Cyrus Schwert 02:37:59 I'll be below it.
Dungeon Master 02:38:06 It is currently looking straight down. You can't cast any magic. So you have 60 feet of falling where you can try to sort of direct yourself to...
Leopold Magnus 02:38:09 It'll be fine. Yeah, it's just pretty dirty, but it'll be all right.
Zariel Torgan 02:38:10 Oh, no. No. It's alright, there's just a rusty mattress down there. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:38:11 That's right. That's right. I moved out of that gaze. It's going to be a soft ending. Don't sweat it. Don't sweat it. There you go.
Dungeon Master 02:38:30 that one of the walls, but you will follow the full 60 unless you succeed wildly on like an acrobatics check. Okay. I do.
Cyrus Schwert 02:38:39 I mean, I guess I'll try that. I'll try to skydive towards the side and catch it, I suppose. You want acrobatic? Shout out to the two dudes.
Leopold Magnus 02:38:52 Oh, no.
Zariel Torgan 02:38:59 Maun.
Dungeon Master 02:39:03 I say you will fall 30 feet at a full speed. You do catch the side of the webbing, but it dislocates your shoulder as you catch on with great force. You'll take 3d6 like falling damage equivalent. Soft rolls. You take four points of damage.
Kaladen Shash 02:39:27 A band.
Dungeon Master 02:39:28 But you still have action because you couldn't cast a spell. You still have action, bonus, and movement. Yeah? You have freedom of movement, so you have full speed.
Cyrus Schwert 02:39:38 Okay. So I'll climb up the web as much as I can. Freedom of movement allow me to... Right, so I can... I'm a total of 60 feet down. So I'll do a full... I haven't done an action yet. I'll do a full...
Dungeon Master 02:39:58 60 feet. Yes. Okay. And then do you get within melee range? Okay. Do you stay below or do you go out of the anti-magic cone at the top?
Cyrus Schwert 02:40:07 dash climb action for a full 60 feet back. Yeah. I mean, the odds of her keeping it down there on me
Cyrus Schwert 02:40:37 feel low I'm gonna stay I'm gonna stay down there to be apart from everybody else maybe give the flank kind of situation to somebody I don't know
Dungeon Master 02:40:43 Probably. Okay. You got it. Yeah. Speaking of which, Leopold, you were up next. You were not moved. You are above. You are flanking with Cyrus now. Out of the magic cone. That's correct. But you are within melee range, so stones would have disadvantage.
Leopold Magnus 02:41:02 out of the magic cone, correct? Excellent. Perfect. Yep. I'll yell out to well, I'll yell out to Sarah. You got it for sure. As he crawls back up like a little imagine him moving real fast.
Dungeon Master 02:41:13 So straight roll. Yes. It is looking very hurt. In my head, she would die this round.
Leopold Magnus 02:41:26 But this, yeah, you're scaring. Is this creature looking pretty hurt? You said it was starting to feel a lot of damage. Okay. So I'm going to... Okay. Well, we'll see. I don't know. I may not have enough juice, but we'll start with the stone just to make sure the sword can do it. So I'll throw a magic stone with disadvantage.
Cyrus Schwert 02:41:26 I'm scurrying.
Kaladen Shash 02:41:44 Finish her. It's a ranged, not a melee. But would it still have advantage?
Zariel Torgan 02:41:46 Do it.
Dungeon Master 02:41:57 Straight. You have advantage with disadvantage, so it's just a normal roll. Oh, so you wouldn't get a flanked bonus. Okay, I'm going to say you still missed. The lower of the two would be 14 regardless. So, next attack.
Leopold Magnus 02:41:59 Oh, excellent. Yeah, I forgot about that. Oh, fuck me. Well, I'm like right on top of the creature in Melee Ring.
Kaladen Shash 02:42:13 I'm going to spell melee attack. Get another one.
Leopold Magnus 02:42:22 Yeah, fair. Then I will strike with my sabers. I'm going to just take two attacks with advantage. Maybe we can roll hot. Looks like one of those 25 will hit once. 22 will hit. All right. Let's see.
Dungeon Master 02:42:29 No force to attack. 25 hits. 22 hits.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:33 Come on. Come on. Right here. Nice. You got it here. You got it.
Kaladen Shash 02:42:48 Yeah, this is warm. Your saber rolls hot. Okay. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:42:49 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 02:42:54 11 damage on that with an additional... Oh, one fire damage, so 12 on the strike. Ah, fuck. Seven. And an additional five. Yeah. Oh, shit. So close. Oh, hell yeah. This is also kind of funny because I think the saber blade...
Dungeon Master 02:43:09 19 to 24 with 21 remaining hit points. How does Leopold finish?
Zariel Torgan 02:43:16 Nice. Nice.
Cyrus Schwert 02:43:19 Mm-hmm.
Kaladen Shash 02:43:19 Yes.
Leopold Magnus 02:43:25 two or so other bosses. So you'll see Leopold kind of on this side wall. And he'll reach out and just start strategically hacking at legs with the saber. And they go flying off. And I'm kind of scurrying around, slicing spider's feet until they all go. And as it falls off of the cliff, I just my saber straight through the heart of the creature.
Leopold Magnus 02:43:52 And you see this giant blast of light as it emerges on the backside of its back, blasting through. And then you'll see its life force get pulled into the saber, and it start to glow. Oh, Cyrus, what are you doing down there?
Zariel Torgan 02:44:02 Nice.
Cyrus Schwert 02:44:12 Cyrus comes crawling out of the hole. Real slow, like. I almost died.
Dungeon Master 02:44:15 as real quick to just interrupt real quick as you finish this creature and the final strike melting through her torso finisher you see her body starts to crumple inward
Dungeon Master 02:44:36 distorting and breaking at weird angles and then it gets almost like absorbed in itself and it crunches and it keeps getting smaller before finally the only thing that's left as like the rest of her carapace absorbs into her is the one single marble eye which then in free space starts to fall. Give me a dexterity saving throw. Anybody who wants to grab it. DC 20.
Kaladen Shash 02:44:55 Get it. React. Grab it. Everybody. I'm going to light... I'm going to light... A deck saving? Did you say a deck save? Or...
Zariel Torgan 02:44:57 Somebody grab that. I'm paralyzed still, right? Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:44:58 Yeah. I mean, I'm going to try it out. Yeah. I think everybody's trying to grab that sucker. So it's a dexterity roll. Oh, too low. Oh, saving throw. Oh, it wouldn't matter for me.
Dungeon Master 02:45:06 You are paralyzed for a minute. Give me a con save. 630 saving throw. 26. Before it even leaves your guys' five feet of space, it's one of those things where people catch balls real quick and just grabs it before it even leaves waist level.
Cyrus Schwert 02:45:21 26, baby. Keep those rolls hot. Just dad reflexes. Catches the kid.
Leopold Magnus 02:45:34 Nice. I'll go up and I'll adjust his eyes into the frame of view. Oh, there he goes, Ariel. Now you can see what's going on.
Zariel Torgan 02:45:34 Very upset. In my mind, I'm like, I'm like, somebody turn me. Yeah. Yeah, somebody turn my head so I can see. Mmm.
Dungeon Master 02:45:36 Zaria, you are still paralyzed. You're seeing all this happen, and they're kind of like high-fiving and stuff, and you're just on the wall looking at them.
Kaladen Shash 02:45:50 You.
Leopold Magnus 02:46:04 Oh, so does anybody want to investigate the bottom of that hole? And I'll just point way down to the bottom. I'll light a torch and then toss it and try to count seconds before it hits the bottom.
Cyrus Schwert 02:46:11 I tried. It's pretty far. It's a little sketch.
Kaladen Shash 02:46:24 Can we still see like that? There's still like a green light down there.
Dungeon Master 02:46:30 You see you drop it. It drops for like two or so seconds and then you see it hits like the webbing comes in at an angle and it catches at the webbing. It's sort of like a shallow bend. More than two seconds. It would be like three or four because it was far enough that Cyrus could drop like potentially 60 feet.
Leopold Magnus 02:46:47 Okay. So it's not that far down. Okay. So you'd say maybe like 80, a hundred feet if, if you were to guess. Okay. Yeah. I'll tell the group, uh,
Kaladen Shash 02:46:58 One round.
Dungeon Master 02:47:02 Something like that, yeah. Perfect. You come to three rounds later.
Zariel Torgan 02:47:08 I rolled another save. I got a 22. Let me add her.
Leopold Magnus 02:47:21 Yeah, I'm kind of with you, Kaladin. What's up with that green light? Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:47:30 Do we see, Jonathan, can we still see like a green light emanating from the bottom of this hole? You said that. Nature.
Dungeon Master 02:47:37 Give me a nature check. It should be wisdom for sure. Yeah. 13 is high enough. You get it's the accumulation of light that the bioluminescent like lichen and fungus give off.
Zariel Torgan 02:47:47 Nature's intelligence, isn't that crazy?
Cyrus Schwert 02:47:52 You know, I think it'd be wisdom.
Leopold Magnus 02:47:52 You'd think it would be wisdom, like, for the Druids, yeah. All right. We're all rolling in. Twenty-four.
Kaladen Shash 02:48:06 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:48:07 But as it just kind of goes down, it kind of gathers in the sort of ever-present mist fog. So it's not like a light source necessarily. It's just like ambient light.
Leopold Magnus 02:48:25 Is it? Do I see if there's any spiders like smaller ones around? I guess would there be any evidence of them in this chamber? 23
Dungeon Master 02:48:36 Give me a perception check as you look around. Leopold, you're looking around and you see...
Kaladen Shash 02:48:37 How do we get our reward if she's dead? Was the reward the marble ball? Right on.
Zariel Torgan 02:48:44 I think so. I think it's like the egg from the phoenix. I think one of us needs to check that thing out. I think it's going to be something...
Leopold Magnus 02:48:53 Oh, that's uh, yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:48:56 I'll swallow it.
Dungeon Master 02:48:57 a swarm of innumerable spiders feasting on the corpse of her larger carapace that she shed the like enormous tarantula that was perched in the corner like they're feasting on that
Dungeon Master 02:49:11 Not paying attention to you right now, but you really don't know how long that's going to last. The sort of theme of your insatiable hunger kind of continues. You guys could go back the way you came, but you know there's a lot of spiders there. You could go down or you could try to find a different way out if you're creative.
Leopold Magnus 02:49:34 Oh, fellas, I don't suppose we surface here. There's lots of those critters crawling around.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:34 I,
Kaladen Shash 02:49:40 I guess we can keep crawling down. Do we, can we feel any other sense of magic? Like what may have been drawing the stone or the water around there? We got into like, you know, cause this fee is aware of something powerful.
Dungeon Master 02:49:58 At the depth that you are, the water pool feels almost level with you. Similar to how you got level with your Fae pool at that one point. It is deeper into the city, but yeah, it's just not close yet.
Kaladen Shash 02:50:10 Okay, but not distance-wise. Okay. Cool, cool, cool. Yes, let's go. Let's go down a quick way.
Cyrus Schwert 02:50:19 If we go down, I can cast Feather Fall on us.
Zariel Torgan 02:50:25 Yeah. We also should probably squirrel suit.
Dungeon Master 02:50:28 Oh, this would be sick. This would be like a parkour thing in a game where you're falling and you have to avoid obstacles. You feather fall, and feather fall works as long as you were in the air. So as soon as you touch the web, it ends. But you guys could fall and kind of push yourself with the grade change and the slope change and kind of clear the ground. As you keep falling, you fall for 100 to 200. You get below what you feel like you should be at.
Dungeon Master 02:50:56 but eventually you hit this old, looks like the Elwynn equivalent of a service tunnel. Very nicely carved, smooth edges. There's a little beautiful carved archway that goes into this tunnel, but there's little extinguished, not lit lamps that line the left side as you go down, but just a tunnel that goes ahead of you.
Leopold Magnus 02:51:24 Jonathan, I guess it seems like the carvings and the way that this was designed may have been built by the Moonhaven dome. OK. Is there anything interesting about the way the tunnel is made?
Dungeon Master 02:51:24 And this is after you guys make it 200 or so feet. Yeah, you are definitely still in the city. This is like the equivalent of finding a deep service tunnel in New New Harbor.
Kaladen Shash 02:51:29 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:51:51 gears or anything like that. Just carved out. Okay. Okay. Oh, thank you, Zario.
Dungeon Master 02:51:53 Not as is. This is very nature-based. There's no gears. You don't see any piping or anything like that.
Zariel Torgan 02:52:08 I'm going to cast... Real quick, I'm going to cast 5th level Cure Wounds on Leo. It'll be another 44 hit points. And then in Cyrus, I'll give you a 3rd level. Oh, that was Healing Word. That was the wrong one. Don't worry about that. Hopefully this is higher.
Kaladen Shash 02:52:08 Do we see, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:52:22 I was a little banged up 44 Nice. Nice.
Cyrus Schwert 02:52:23 Thanks. Thanks.
Zariel Torgan 02:52:39 Statistically, it should be. Holy smokes, that was a good roll. Alright, we're good. Yeah, I'm good.
Dungeon Master 02:52:49 Hell yeah. And I imagine you guys are going to want to move forward. Are you guys using any source of light or are you going based off of just dark vision for those who have it?
Cyrus Schwert 02:52:54 That was awesome.
Kaladen Shash 02:53:14 Is it bioluminescent throughout this webbing as well? Okay. Just in the web. Do we see in the, is there anything on the walls around the tunnel? Maybe description of what it is? No.
Dungeon Master 02:53:18 No, the work stone doesn't seem to have it. The bioluminescent fungi seem to thrive like weaving itself in the web, where there is moisture provided. Nothing like that here. Seems like there's no power source down here. Nothing that you see. Not where you're at. Perfect.
Leopold Magnus 02:53:41 I could just light a torch. Oh, okay. There you go.
Cyrus Schwert 02:53:41 I focus on my sword first. I cast light on it. On my sword. It lights up. I'm kind of swinging it around like a
Dungeon Master 02:53:49 Cast light on your sword. Light going up. It goes a certain depth into the tunnel before you see just like a curve of darkness where it doesn't quite pierce. Look behind you. You just see sort of the webbing end and attach. Like this is where the spiders had gotten here at some point, but maybe it couldn't get past or something. And you're like looking up and you don't hear anything. So we'll sort of leave this session with
Dungeon Master 02:54:19 you guys starting to make your way forward in the tunnel into the night, into the darkness. And we'll call it there. Yeah, I gotta make it, so we'll... And as soon as...
Leopold Magnus 02:54:29 nice oh yeah okay
Zariel Torgan 02:54:31 I'm excited to see what that eye stone thing does. I think it's going to be really good. Mm-hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 02:54:31 Good night.
Kaladen Shash 02:54:31 It'll be super rad. Someone's going to get some sweet buffs.
Dungeon Master 02:54:43 somebody attunes to it, you'll get the same sort of story that you're going to have the main, like they've got extra stuff with them, but Rex, I figured out the curse manifestation for Leopold. So I'll send you a message on it. I think you'll like it.
Leopold Magnus 02:55:00 That's sick. Oh, yeah. I look forward to checking it out. Yeah, I'm just on my laptop, so I've just been walking around. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:55:11 Can I add real quick? I think one of my favorite things is that Rex will turn his camera off and he'll come back and he'll be in a different place with different clothes with a different backdrop. There's no continuity with this video feed. It just makes me giggle.
Kaladen Shash 02:55:26 like moving around just moving around man yeah i saw a lot of position change there yeah yeah yeah yeah
Leopold Magnus 02:55:30 but often when I'm when my camera's off I'm just like getting a drink or something like that too but I'm listening yeah fuck yeah yeah yeah nothing I got going on we should try to get an in person session at some point though it's been a long time
Zariel Torgan 02:55:44 All right, sweet. Well, I think we're all good for next week, right? Sweet. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:55:49 Could be. It has. It's just that time of the year where travel is almost impossible for certain people.
Leopold Magnus 02:56:01 yeah true coming up I feel like yeah yeah I would bet by like end of April May should be pretty nice weather passable cool well good games yeah
Kaladen Shash 02:56:05 It's harder passes. Yeah, we'll get some good days. Yeah. Good game. Later.
Zariel Torgan 02:56:15 Absolutely. Sweet. All right. Well, thank you, Jonathan. That was awesome. All right. Awesome.
Leopold Magnus 02:56:30 You all take it easy. Yep.
Dungeon Master 02:56:31 Okay. It's session.
Cyrus Schwert 02:56:33 Thanks, Charlie.

0:00:00: Dungeon Master: Your armors had already been upgraded. So like you already have the new armor technically. Did it change the healing things or is everything still the same? You have two instead of one. Two instead of one, yes. Okay, cool. Something that I could like adjust technically but not have to adjust. Gotcha. Okay, yeah.
0:00:30: Speaker_3: I think I want to do some shopping.
0:00:33: Speaker_3: I could be down for, so I think on the list right now, just like if today's a day of just like putzing and taking care of things before we start our next Lycan thing, I'm fine with trying to visit like some spots to buy a few things. We've got like, I've got a thousand coins. I got a lot of money. We didn't get our partial gold yet.
0:00:52: Dungeon Master: We didn't get our partial gold.
0:00:53: Dungeon Master: You guys just didn't add it. So it'd be, if you take the tokens, I think you only get 25 gold.  because this is not betting on the side, but your new raise, you would have gotten 45.
0:01:05: Speaker_2: 45 gold?
0:01:08: Speaker_4: How did I get the rest of this gold, then, if we're all betting on something?
0:01:12: Speaker_2: We got a shit ton from the fighting pits. Yeah, that makes sense.
0:01:14: Speaker_4: Yeah, that makes sense.
0:01:15: Speaker_2: Remember, Grandpa Bot really played it up. Yeah.
0:01:15: Speaker_3: Remember, Grandpa Bot really played it up.
0:01:18: Speaker_3: I was going to say, I've got 1,082 right now, just in my purse. I have, like, 850. Yeah. And I got some platinum.
0:01:22: Speaker_2: I have, like, 850. Yeah. And I got some platinum.
0:01:25: Speaker_3: There you go. I'm counting nothing but gold.
0:01:29: Speaker_3: Oh, no, I got silver. I got silver. Never mind.
0:01:30: Speaker_2: I got silver.
0:01:32: Speaker_2: You said 45, right, Jonathan?
0:01:35: Speaker_3: What kind of access? You said we have better access now. What kind of access do we have in the library? Would I be able to peruse generally known low-level evocation spells?
0:01:46: Dungeon Master: Would you guys like to go to your new, like, room area? Let's go. Let's take our shift tour. Yeah, let's go and check it out. Go ahead and move all your shit.
0:01:49: Speaker_3: Let's go. Let's take our shift tour. Yeah, let's go and check it out.
0:01:55: Dungeon Master: Get your fucking snacks out of here.
0:01:59: Dungeon Master: A big, I'll describe it in detail, but as you guys, yeah, there's two here. You, you make your way to this new fort the Omen Knights possess on their own.
0:02:11: Dungeon Master: You walk in, you see this large sort of slate gray room. It's not as circular as I've got it drawn in. It's more like octagonal with sharp edges that are just making up a lot. So it's got edges to it. You notice there are 10 doors other than the entry door that you walk into. In the hallway, there's some stuff you didn't really look into. But as you walk in, you see this open space of multiple like  Tables for eating there's like its own little cafe area some fighting dummies weapons things like that And you notice that there are like various overnight sort of practicing and moving around Particularly there seems to be like a large group around the first fighting pit doing something But the big thing to go to the questions you guys just asked is you remember that when you were looking in the library? That like there was like this like arcane projection  here there is a sort of inset to the wall arcane projection that's got like a bunch of different things like it almost just looks like a home screen for a computer like it has different things that it can't do.
0:03:37: Speaker_4: Roughly how big is this entire space just like width wise? 200 feet.
0:03:42: Speaker_4: Pretty massive like football field size.
0:03:42: Dungeon Master: Pretty massive like football field size.
0:03:45: Dungeon Master: Like enough that there are roughly what seems to be around 40 people in this space. You notice, and this would be like an easy history check, and you guys have been in the Legionnaire long enough that you can figure this out. The Omen Knights have 10.
0:04:09: Speaker_3: Okay, are there a lot of people we don't recognize Okay, except for the person at the front door you see a guard as you walk into the space a man to your guys's right Long luscious hair.
0:04:14: Dungeon Master: He's got like platinum armor on with like his symbols of the normal black one, but it's Silvera Sunseeker Oh
0:04:43: Dungeon Master: Right, because I, uh, I fucking retired or something. That's totally true. Like, this is just a part-time gig. They sort of, like, offer me something to come and talk with the new people and then guard the door, but I mostly work at Sunny Days. It's the grocery store. My father owns it. It's pretty rad.
0:05:03: Speaker_2: Well, Sunseeker, that's quite a fall from grace for you. How do you feel about that, Mr. Ego Man?
0:05:12: Speaker_2: well I thought the most successful business chain in the market I thought overnight was your hmm how do I say it your personality the last mission I went on my entire family died laser laser and laser where we're family members of you intentionally get it wrong it's
0:05:36: Speaker_2: Oh dear, yes.
0:05:40: Speaker_4: They're dead though.
0:05:41: Speaker_4: Cousins of yours?
0:05:44: Speaker_4: Friends.
0:05:44: Dungeon Master: Lifelong friends.
0:05:46: Dungeon Master: Will be missed for sure.
0:05:48: Dungeon Master: Let's pour one out. Right, so you guys are the new guys. I forgot about that.
0:06:03: Dungeon Master: Oh, he has this thing, soft tissue. He probably won't make it. I think they're going to demote him pretty quickly, but I'll have to promote somebody else instead. Your new commanding officer points at the fighting pit, and he's like, just putting on a show right now, but you want to report in to her when you guys get all settled in. And then he's got his large spear pointed to the top corner, and he goes, you guys' room is number nine right up there.  Get, you know, comfortable, familiar. I'm working another 30 minutes. You guys want to get a beer afterwards, but good to see you guys.
0:06:05: Speaker_2: He probably won't make it.
0:06:54: Speaker_4: is there like an armament area or like uh just like extras if you wanted to get like down here okay this is just like uh basic weapons nothing nothing better than what you guys would have in theory maybe like a plus one but not because it's magical just because
0:07:16: Speaker_2: Is there a workspace, workshop area with maybe some parts, extra? Right, right.
0:07:20: Dungeon Master: Right, right. But you do notice that like over here is a counter and there are some people
0:07:48: Dungeon Master: There are a couple people there seems to be a Rounder more Dwarvish origin fella fully bald on top very full beard on the bottom dark tan skin with some brown eyes short for a dwarf His name is a Rurik Flint Forge He's got a little name tag that says that  He goes, hey, how can I help you?
0:08:17: Speaker_4: Well, we're just new, and we're checking out the facilities. Is there anything we should know about it since we're stationed here?
0:08:24: Dungeon Master: Yeah, 100%. You have any weapons that you like or maybe don't particularly like, and you're like, can I do something with this? I've got a unique smithing style.
0:08:35: Dungeon Master: It's like I can make it good with a cost. Or I can just make it a little bit better up to you guys.  You bring weapons to me, a little bit of money, and I'll hook you guys up.
0:08:50: Speaker_3: Are they just plus one-ing the weapon?
0:08:54: Dungeon Master: This guy can do certain things. You'd have to go through his list, and I'd have to find my list of what he can do. But in essence, he can take things and give you  What's called like a deadly edge or something where it's you always roll with disadvantage but when you hit you roll your d20 is the damage die instead so like he can do things to weapons to make them like weird but good and like other things like that I have to find my full list. That's cool. Like a min max type.
0:09:25: Speaker_2: Like a min max type. Yes, he can do things like that too.
0:09:26: Dungeon Master: Yes, he can do things like that too.
0:09:28: Speaker_2: Just weapons?
0:09:30: Dungeon Master: Yes, well, he might have some armor stuff. Hold on, let me, while you guys chat passively, we'll get back to that.
0:09:35: Speaker_3: Also, when we drop, I drop off those scales with hammock. Would it be reasonable that she'd be able to make something before we leave the dome or before we're done with the next mission?
0:09:44: Speaker_3: Yeah, like you wouldn't, you'd like to get like a shoulder thing or a breastplate.
0:09:48: Dungeon Master: Yeah, like you wouldn't, you'd like to get like a shoulder thing or a breastplate. Just to update the, I guess, I'm on half plate, so I think it's like one chest plate, one shoulder.
0:09:51: Speaker_3: Just to update the, I guess, I'm on half plate, so I think it's like one chest plate, one shoulder.
0:09:59: Speaker_3: Yes, that would be something you can get done like the next day or so. Okay, cool.
0:10:04: Speaker_3: She's already got the tarantulas.
0:10:05: Speaker_4: We rested in the cave when we walked back, so it's like morning. Late morning, yeah.
0:10:10: Dungeon Master: Late morning, yeah.
0:10:11: Speaker_4: Okay, so we have the whole day.
0:10:14: Speaker_3: Yeah, I'm good. I'm okay visiting like a market area. I was gonna say, I wanted to look at this screen and just kind of flip through, maybe, and see what... Yeah, Altered Self.
0:10:21: Speaker_3: Altered Self. Is there a second level I can run off that screen? That'd be fine.
0:10:27: Speaker_2: Yeah, or I guess is it more a directory? Or is it like a repository of the actual spells?
0:10:34: Speaker_3: What did we say? 50 gold per level? What's the fee for copying?
0:10:40: Dungeon Master: Okay, so, talking with Rurik, he tells you, he's like, I can make it precise, I can make it brutal, I can make it aggressive, balanced, surgical, destructive, calculated, vicious, he's like, you're writing this down, just kidding, you don't have to, I got it. Masterwork or perfect the edge, up to you guys.
0:11:03: Speaker_3: Masterwork or perfect the edge, up to you guys.
0:11:06: Speaker_3: And with each of those, we just further inquire and learn. You learn about what is a T4
0:11:10: Dungeon Master: I could also just tell you, but.
0:11:16: Speaker_3: Only if I'm interested in trying to do something mild to Lightbringer, but I don't think I want to do like the first one you described where it's like disadvantage on attacks. All or nothing.
0:11:23: Speaker_2: All or nothing.
0:11:25: Dungeon Master: Yeah, so Precise, the first one is weapon critical hits on 19 and 20. Does not stack with improved critical, the class bonus. Brutal is after rolling your damage dice, roll a second die of the same type. If it is the same as your damage die, your damage becomes the max possible.  So you roll a d10, you roll an 8, you throw another d10, it's another 8, you roll max damage instead. So there's a chance of buffing into max. But I have to match the same number from roll 2 to roll 2.
0:11:52: Speaker_3: But I have to match the same number from roll 2 to roll 2. Yeah, you roll a 1, you roll a 1, you roll a 10 instead.
0:11:54: Dungeon Master: Yeah, you roll a 1, you roll a 1, you roll a 10 instead. Aggressive is re-roll ones on the damage die. Balanced is roll the damage die twice, average the two rolls. Surgical is when a specific number, your choice,  is reroll ones and twos on damage die. Calculated is advantage on damage rolls. Roll damage twice, take higher of two. Wait, wait, wait. Great. I already do damage.
0:12:30: Speaker_3: I already do damage. It's not attack. It's not attack. It's damage.
0:12:32: Dungeon Master: It's not attack.
0:12:32: Dungeon Master: Yeah.
0:12:34: Dungeon Master: It calculated is advantage on damage rolls. Roll damage twice, take the higher of two. Vicious is deal three times the damage on a critical hit. Modifier is still two times, but the damage is three times.
0:12:50: Speaker_3: You're getting way better and better and better and better the price of costs cost a pretty penny.
0:12:50: Dungeon Master: You're getting way better and better and better and better the price of costs cost a pretty penny. I don't have that Masterwork is improved. I just died by one step example a d6 becomes a d8 if d12 becomes 2d6 D12 on a sword swing Perfected edge is improved damage died by two steps. Oh shit coming.
0:12:52: Speaker_3: I don't have that Masterwork is improved. I just died by one step example a d6 becomes a d8 if d12 becomes 2d6 D12 on a sword swing Perfected edge is improved damage died by two steps.
0:13:11: Speaker_3: Oh shit coming. All right, so what would I roll if I'm so?
0:13:12: Dungeon Master: All right, so what would I roll if I'm so?
0:13:14: Dungeon Master: then 2d8 instead so oh okay that's better that's almost it yeah there you go and what was the price on those last two?
0:13:25: Speaker_3: Perfected Edge is 10,000, Masterwork is 3,000, Vicious is 2,400, Calculated is 1,000, Destructive is 500, Surgical is 250 which is pretty good for that one right but I
0:13:28: Dungeon Master: Perfected Edge is 10,000, Masterwork is 3,000, Vicious is 2,400, Calculated is 1,000, Destructive is 500, Surgical is 250 which is pretty good for that one right but I
0:13:46: Dungeon Master: that would be um that's only on the web destructive that was the one that's a thousand sorry the 500 one do we do we have a just open to the public or i guess open to us
0:14:07: Speaker_3: I'll just ask about the dragon. Yeah, I haven't I haven't uh, you guys were just there just just yes Yeah, we'll do we were in kind of a rush.
0:14:13: Dungeon Master: Yes. So if you guys wanted to say while you were there you were doing something That's fine because he just wants to shop.
0:14:20: Speaker_3: Yeah.
0:14:21: Dungeon Master: Yeah. I just want to see we got anything cool.
0:14:22: Speaker_4: Um
0:14:25: Speaker_4: Yeah, can I go in and just be like, yeah, can I take a peek at anything? Anything that might be good for me? You know, not rip my hands, but, you know, if you got anything cool.
0:14:37: Dungeon Master: Him off looks around, you see like in her shop is this huge, like just mess of a bunch of different things. She goes, ah, what do you want?
0:14:46: Dungeon Master: I can try to find something. I don't want you to just be like, hey, find me a list of 10 things. And then somebody has to make a list
0:15:00: Speaker_4: Maybe like a ring or something, or like a... I don't know. Something that does something cool, makes me harder to hit. Or maybe like, you know, makes me not hurt so much.
0:15:12: Speaker_4: Something like that. I don't know. Maybe. Like a ring of protection, in theory.
0:15:18: Dungeon Master: I mean, maybe if you have it. I don't know. Well, it really just seems like you're trying to bypass the restrictions placed on your class, so to speak,  She's like, uh, well, I don't have a ring of power right now But I've got the blueprints and schematics and I can pump in the right arcane enchantments It'll take me a little bit I got I can run it on my machine over there you see like you're in Because if you guys remember you walk into her shop and it's like the main space and then like to the left is her
0:15:27: Speaker_4: She's like, uh, well, I don't have a ring of power right now But I've got the blueprints and schematics and I can pump in the right arcane enchantments It'll take me a little bit I got I can run it on my machine over there you see like you're in Because if you guys remember you walk into her shop and it's like the main space and then like to the left is her
0:15:32: Dungeon Master: special shop that normally is just like her and Leopold do stuff in you're in that space with her now and she points over and she's got this arcane bench that has runes all over it glyphs circles things like that and you see she like walks over and she presses some things and she drags over like sliders on the arcanes and like lights up and you see like these like framing sort of rises up out of it like printed and then she's like puts  like zapping it and turning it and engraving it. She's like, that'll take a little bit, but it'll turn it out tomorrow. I'm really focusing on this armor piece over here.
0:16:30: Dungeon Master: You see that she had just been given the scales for it. So she's like, she's like drawing up like a shoulder pad that goes into like a chest piece. Like, that'll be ready. All right, how much should I do for that?
0:16:45: Dungeon Master: Bring your protections or like,  They're normally pretty pricey, but you guys are kind of... Well, actually, she looks at Leopold.
0:16:52: Dungeon Master: A thousand gold.
0:16:57: Speaker_4: Well, you might take it off that there machine, because I don't have that much money. Maybe I'll come back later and try it.
0:17:07: Speaker_4: Don't you worry.
0:17:07: Speaker_2: Don't you worry. I might be able to fix something up later. Oh, all right. We'll try that.
0:17:11: Speaker_2: This chump... Really starting to create the divide there.
0:17:32: Speaker_3: Ring of protections are just plus ones, right? It's just plus one to only armor class.
0:17:39: Speaker_3: It's pretty uh, it's pretty pretty slick.
0:17:40: Speaker_2: They're pretty great.
0:17:42: Speaker_3: So I'll say the savings doors is almost better than the armor class, but yes Right just stays on yeah, yeah, so yeah you go from 14 like 15, I mean which isn't nothing but Would we?
0:18:08: Speaker_3: I have the opportunity, because didn't we burn through? I wasn't holding any, but I know I used one. Well, one was given, administered to me, the liquid potions. Yeah. Or the syringes that we had. Oh, right.
0:18:19: Speaker_2: Oh, right.
0:18:20: Speaker_3: What's that look like as far as inventory? Maybe that's where I'll spend our money.
0:18:24: Speaker_3: I had two, and now it shows I have one.
0:18:26: Speaker_4: Yeah.
0:18:28: Speaker_2: Yeah. I don't think I have any. I don't think I have any heals. Well, I have one. Because you got me up twice.
0:18:31: Speaker_4: Well, I have one. Because you got me up twice.
0:18:32: Speaker_4: Yeah. Then you used my suit, and then I think you used a syringe.
0:18:36: Speaker_4: Yeah, well, yeah, because, um,
0:18:38: Speaker_4: yeah i've never used a potion and i've had two this whole time and so we use one on you so i've got one actual physical potion i'm probably gonna i'm probably gonna spend my thousand on that rather than a ring you know that's not a bad idea no i'll give you i can give you 300 or 300 gold so you can get the ring uh jonathan i have a a book it's called the chronicles of n n a with hamlock you happen to remember what that is
0:19:02: Dungeon Master: New New Arbor.
0:19:03: Speaker_2: New New Arbor. Do you know, do you want her to finish, or you're going to try to make her ring? Yes, I'm saying do you want her to finish the ring for now, early game?
0:19:21: Speaker_3: um 700 more gold i can spend on potions yeah just so we've got our buffs and sets how much gold do you have can i can i just got 700 and change i can i got like 750 uh can i can i like uh try to convince ham hawk to give me a little better of a deal can i be like you guys are talking you guys um rex are not
0:19:43: Speaker_3: Okay, all right, okay, yeah, yeah, I'll take that in mind and I'll have her I'll have her continue So you're gonna only take 250 because I've got I've got 750, okay
0:19:46: Dungeon Master: Okay, all right, okay, yeah, yeah, I'll take that in mind and I'll have her I'll have her continue So you're gonna only take 250 because I've got I've got 750, okay
0:20:00: Speaker_4: And I am now destitute.
0:20:02: Speaker_3: You're going to buy health potions? Yeah, I still have 820 gold for, essentially, to spend on some potions. That's about what I have. I was going to try and, uh... I was going to spend 100 on a level 2 spell. Okay. So I've got sub-200 gold potions.
0:20:09: Speaker_2: I was going to try and, uh... I was going to spend 100 on a level 2 spell.
0:20:12: Speaker_2: So I've got sub-200 gold potions.
0:20:15: Speaker_2: So I'm going to use a couple. I don't know how much materials will be for that sword, but I was going to try and scrounge up stuff. Yeah, well, I heard.  Whatever is left, I can buy. It's already gone.
0:20:15: Speaker_3: So I'm going to use a couple.
0:20:20: Dungeon Master: Yeah, well, I heard.  Whatever is left, I can buy. It's already gone. You can tell that she was probably going to give you a better price even, but the fact that you guys did not give her that power cord. Just a little penny is just like... Right.
0:20:34: Dungeon Master: It's still...  arcane power from time to time and it just like we'll do it for her but um yeah you got you you could have had a better deal but you guys sort of burning that bridge slowly but surely if we ever just like get the fuck out of here we are taking that with us right take that whole thing that can be taken apart put in the pocket where
0:21:06: Speaker_3: Is it, would there be a potion?
0:21:08: Speaker_3: There's no potion shop. How did we get our syringes the first time? You, um, you went to a shop.
0:21:15: Dungeon Master: Oh, did we? Yeah. Okay. In the storm district, we found a couple shops.
0:21:15: Speaker_3: Oh, did we? Yeah.
0:21:18: Speaker_2: What's this dusty old guy, what was his name? Uh, yeah, we can look it up.
0:21:23: Speaker_2: Oh, the potion guy.
0:21:26: Speaker_2: Yeah. He was a character. Yeah.
0:21:32: Speaker_2: I was going to say, I could pull up the notebook.
0:21:35: Speaker_4: So we've got potions, spells for the library.
0:21:38: Speaker_4: Is there anything else we want to do today before we start prepping for our?
0:21:45: Speaker_3: No, if we just need to get any other information about our investigation.
0:21:48: Speaker_3: Yeah. I was going to buy some materials for the laser sword.
0:21:56: Dungeon Master: Is there anywhere we can sell stuff that we've picked up along the way?
0:22:14: Speaker_3: Yeah, you got an iron arm, yeah, well, I mean that was from touching the thing though, right that it that wasn't a matter of
0:23:50: Speaker_2: Okay, so Jonathan, where should I be looking for supplies for my general wears?
0:23:55: Dungeon Master: Okay Sunny days I will oh, so they're not just a grocery store.
0:23:58: Speaker_2: They're also a General store, okay
0:24:01: Dungeon Master: They're also a General store, okay
0:24:11: Speaker_2: I think while these guys are dealing with that, I'll peel off to... So this is technically before you had gone to the new building.
0:24:19: Speaker_2: Okay.
0:24:19: Dungeon Master: So we'll say this is like your guys' walk up. You guys want to go shopping first. So we'll say which you want to go to market. I just have a general city map, so we'll call this the same for all of them.
0:24:29: Speaker_2: Is it Nerman? It was Nerman.
0:24:31: Dungeon Master: It was Nerman.
0:24:33: Speaker_2: The Feathered Quill Scroll Shop located off the side street in Market District.
0:24:49: Speaker_2: There's also Philandra Sprawlweaver?
0:24:53: Dungeon Master: I think it was supposed to be Scrollweaver.
0:24:54: Dungeon Master: Scrollweaver?
0:24:58: Dungeon Master: Philandra.
0:25:01: Dungeon Master: Enigmatic. She had the Scrollshot. Nurman had just like the general stuff. I think it just makes it up a little bit. Okay.
0:25:11: Speaker_4: Okay.
0:25:17: Speaker_3: I think so. Yeah. Yeah.
0:25:41: Speaker_2: Yeah, those are pretty yummy, aren't they? Have you had the dots? No. Okay, so in general they're really good, but that flavor I haven't had before, it's... Oh yeah, garlicky parmesan.
0:25:44: Speaker_4: No.
0:25:50: Speaker_2: Yeah, exactly. Okay, so sunny days it is to visit Sunseeker and his family.
0:26:03: Speaker_4: he's probably still on shift oh yeah yeah yeah he's still he because he would be at the uh he would technically be um still on guard right on the berries right there um and i have a shopping list i presume of things that i'm going to want to buy say that you like get the stuff you need okay
0:26:31: Dungeon Master: doing a run in the ring. It was really funny to watch. So it's just, what, they coming?
0:26:46: Dungeon Master: Okay.
0:26:48: Dungeon Master: We'll just make the list retro and say that. You can get all the things you need. You would need metal to make the frame, gems of, we'll say gems worth 500 gold, things like that.
0:26:53: Speaker_2: You would need metal to make the frame, gems of, we'll say gems worth 500 gold, things like that.
0:27:03: Speaker_2: So 500 gold is what I would send me back Roughly you can say cost of metallic material and like leather for leather wrapping it things like that would be a hundred total and gems Diamond worth 500 gems or equivalent so you can do multiple 600 gold 600 gold.
0:27:06: Dungeon Master: Call it good Okay, what are those syringes cost?  Same as health pox so 50 for a basic 250 for a greater. What's two? What's a greater? Is that a 2d for 2d 4 plus 2 is basic graders 44 plus 4 Superior is 66 plus 6 and supreme is 10d 4 plus 10. I can do three graders That's 250 apiece.
0:27:42: Speaker_3: Yes, 250 apiece and all by one because at 290 left 250 we're gonna have to make some money though
0:27:55: Speaker_3: We've got to do this next mission. Maybe not take a token.
0:27:58: Speaker_3: Yeah. You guys have been very item and OP driven right now.
0:27:59: Speaker_2: Yeah.
0:27:59: Dungeon Master: You guys have been very item and OP driven right now.

0:28:02: Speaker_3: Oh, 100%. You've got to do it when you're early.

0:28:23: Speaker_2: And I'm buying a grader. Three graders, okay. Three graders, you're doing material components.
0:28:23: Dungeon Master: Three graders, okay. Three graders, you're doing material components. He tells you that he doesn't have the gemstones, but that he says her name and you're like, he's like, oh, but there's this gal, Philandra. And you're like, we know Philandra. So then you go to her place. She's like the very, she's the elven woman who's just like, oh darling, of course.  and just like gems inlaid in different spots with like the price points already on them. Just like take your pick.

0:28:56: Dungeon Master: Excellent. Always a pleasure. Could I have traded my non-magical shield for like a big glove?
0:28:59: Speaker_4: Like, maybe it's like a lady's... Yes, and since she would also have something like that, like a full-length glove.
0:29:03: Dungeon Master: You can get a leather one, so it's maybe not like sheer velvet or something like that, but like, you can get a thick leather... A velvet glove? A leather riding glove or something like that. Oh, okay. Yeah, just a full arm. She's like, oh, this is an antique from back when people were still riding horses, I presume. And she's like, she looks at it and she goes, ten?
0:29:31: Speaker_4: Well, I happen to have this awesome shield.
0:29:39: Dungeon Master: I give her my old shield. And then you go to, oh I guess, do you want to go meet the Sunseeker family or get everything from Merlin?
0:29:53: Speaker_2: Uh, sure, I'll go talk to the Sunseekers.
0:30:10: Dungeon Master: You walk into this very nice, it's like you walk in, the doors go shhhh. They go outside, yeah, it's like a monster.  looking through large aisles people like carts moving around there's like regular cashiers and you see a man unmistakably a Sunseeker he is 6'7 gorgeous blonde hair other than the Lord of Advancement maybe the most elven gentleman you've met he's definitely older in age he's moving around with just like he like  Struts very slowly. He's not in a rush hands sort of gently clasped behind his back just admiring his store Looks to you doesn't recognize you guys, but just gentle nods and sort of like could not be bothered to keep walking He disappears into the aisles I'll grab a car Start looking down the aisles
0:31:22: Speaker_2: Today we're running a sale on ground chicken. I love that you guys have the spiced cranberry spread.
0:31:46: Speaker_3: They make a spiced one?
0:31:47: Speaker_2: They make a spiced one?
0:31:48: Speaker_3: It's good. It's the holiday spread.
0:32:00: Dungeon Master: You're a, you know, a seven foot warthog with this tiny little carcass.
0:32:06: Speaker_2: Looking around for leather, some iron. You take out this like very organized shelf.
0:32:10: Dungeon Master: You take out this like very organized shelf. It's got little prices on it. You build everything together.
0:32:43: Speaker_2: How much is the chicken on sale for? Five silver.
0:32:48: Speaker_2: Five silver? I'll also throw one of those in my cart. This is dazzling background music for getting a haircut in elevators.
0:32:50: Dungeon Master: This is dazzling background music for getting a haircut in elevators.
0:32:54: Speaker_2: A haircut in an elevator?
0:32:59: Speaker_2: Yeah, I'll pick the materials up and rotisserie chicken for the road.
0:33:05: Speaker_3: as you're getting checked out in the line. I thought we've never seen you actually eat food.
0:33:06: Dungeon Master: as you're getting checked out in the line.
0:33:07: Dungeon Master: I thought we've never seen you actually eat food.
0:33:09: Speaker_2: Oh no, I just throw it into my metal husk. Yeah, as they're like bringing things up.
0:33:11: Speaker_3: Yeah, as they're like bringing things up. It plops out whenever the steel defender comes out.
0:33:12: Dungeon Master: It plops out whenever the steel defender comes out. It just starts smelling really bad.
0:33:15: Speaker_2: It just starts smelling really bad.
0:33:18: Dungeon Master: Goes over to that line. You see a room flash that brings up the price as they're just like checking it out. This little teenage half-elf just goes, anything else?
0:33:31: Dungeon Master: Oh, um.
0:33:52: Dungeon Master: Do you think I can be a Legionnaire?
0:33:58: Dungeon Master: My mom says I'm anemic.
0:34:00: Dungeon Master: Well, don't listen to her. Get on out there.
0:34:06: Dungeon Master: But you get the things you need, so go ahead and give me, as you've got everything together, that's it right there, go ahead and give me just either, I bet your Arcana's better than your Intelligence, but either Arcana or Intelligence check, just sort of put together how long it's gonna take you to complete this.
0:34:28: Speaker_2: Yeah, yeah, it's plus eight.
0:34:34: Speaker_2: I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna pull an all-nighter Well, you know, I mean I'm absorbed into this I'm not gonna look up I'm just gonna set my sights to it
0:35:01: Speaker_3: Does he meditate like I do? Does he actually require a full... He has to be inactive for a certain amount of time.
0:35:07: Speaker_2: I think it's only six hours for a sentry to rest now. He's aware of his surroundings, so he's always on sentry guard.
0:35:08: Dungeon Master: I think it's only six hours for a sentry to rest now. He's aware of his surroundings, so he's always on sentry guard. But it's eight, you know what I'm saying? But it's eight, yeah. Which is why I've watched... People eat spiders.
0:35:15: Speaker_2: Which is why I've watched... People eat spiders.
0:35:18: Dungeon Master: Yep.
0:35:18: Speaker_2: Yep. Yep, sentry. Cool, cool, cool.
0:35:19: Dungeon Master: Yep, sentry.
0:35:24: Speaker_4: So we got...
0:35:31: Speaker_2: What is this? Century's Rest. Six hours inactive for Century's Rest.
0:35:47: Speaker_2: Took another 20 stress points and evaporated into dust.
0:35:47: Dungeon Master: Took another 20 stress points and evaporated into dust.
0:35:54: Speaker_2: I'm pulling an all-nighter in the pocket workshop.
0:35:56: Speaker_3: I think we're back to the place. Can I look at the arcades?
0:35:59: Dungeon Master: there is a big sort of fighting exhibition thing going on here.
0:36:11: Dungeon Master: You guys know your room is up there. There's an arcane screen up here. Kaladin is checking out the screen. As you walk over to that, you walk up and you see that in your Omen knight armor, towards your wrist, on like either a strap or a  you see Arun start to glow that you hadn't seen before. It's like flashing, and you're like, oh. Closer it gets, the brighter it gets. And you close it, and it goes, meow. And then the screen flashes, and it says, welcome, Calvin, configuring settings.
0:36:46: Dungeon Master: Please install more computers.
0:36:49: Dungeon Master: Your system's up for it. Not the thing. Please restart your computer. As you're looking through, it looks like a personal sort of library-type deal, where you can request things to be put on hold.  and there's a little tube to the side where like you're playing around with it over the course of like the next 10 minutes or so you're like oh I want to see if I can get this scroll and you press it and it says like normal deposit fee it'll be like you know 10 gold to rent and then you you know transfer the funds and then it comes in and you can scan the scroll and stuff and learn things.
0:37:22: Dungeon Master: So is it just $10 to scan, or is it? $10 to rent, and then whatever cost of normal stuff. So your School of Magic is still half price. All the normal rules apply, but it's cheaper than going to it before and paying. That's OK. So I think it's abduration, isn't it?
0:37:41: Speaker_2: Oh, so if it's within your? It's half time of money. Cool. Nice.
0:37:43: Speaker_3: Cool.
0:37:46: Speaker_3: How do you look those up? So you can go Manage Spells. It'll take you into your... So if you look at your Spell List and hit Manage Spells, you can look at Spell Book.
0:37:56: Speaker_3: Prepared is what you've got. Spell Book is everything in your current book. Add Spells, then it accesses all of the Wizarding Lists.
0:38:05: Dungeon Master: But to answer the other question, it's like not even on your character sheet, it's like the basic class description will tell you that the class of wizard, the school, you have one of the abilities is like when you transcribe spells of your school, it's half price, half time.
0:38:05: Speaker_3: But to answer the other question, it's like not even on your character sheet, it's like the basic class description will tell you that the class of wizard, the school, you have one of the abilities is like when you transcribe spells of your school, it's half price, half time.
0:38:20: Speaker_3: Okay. So I need to, because it's a level two, I need 50 gold. I only have 101 gold right now. I had 96 gold and 50 silver.
0:38:20: Speaker_4: Okay.
0:38:30: Speaker_2: Let me see.
0:38:33: Dungeon Master: Could I sell my scimitar to the guy?
0:38:37: Dungeon Master: Yeah, they'll give you 20 gold for it. Yeah, I'll give you that 20.
0:38:40: Speaker_3: Cool, I can now pay the 110 total to take these off. To do all of that.
0:38:46: Speaker_3: So I'm going to copy Alter Self into my spellbook.
0:38:52: Speaker_3: So I'm going to leave the shield that's here in my inventory so that it keeps affecting my AC. I feel like there should be more spells.
0:38:55: Speaker_2: I feel like there should be more spells. So look at add spell. So then there's level ones.
0:38:58: Speaker_3: So then there's level ones. You're only a level one wizard. Oh, OK. So that's four level one. Got it. OK. So if I was a higher level wizard, I could. Correct. Then there are level twos and threes and fours.
0:39:05: Speaker_2: Got it. OK. So if I was a higher level wizard, I could.
0:39:09: Speaker_2: Correct. Then there are level twos and threes and fours.
0:39:13: Speaker_3: You've got to decide, like, what's the tradeoff for 17 Artificer or 16 Artificer?
0:39:16: Speaker_3: Like, where do you want to stop at Artificer? Yeah. Because that'll dictate how far you're willing to go in Wizardry.
0:39:25: Speaker_2: Yeah, well, and that was the other thing. I think I was going to do another level of Artificer for the next one.
0:39:31: Speaker_3: Yeah.
0:39:32: Speaker_2: It's going to be a while before I get to those.
0:39:34: Speaker_3: Cool, so that guy now has 0 gold.
0:39:39: Speaker_2: Oh, you know what? I might have some higher level Artificer spells, actually.  Oh but I can't add. You just get what you get. Any other plans?
0:40:06: Dungeon Master: The room.
0:40:07: Speaker_2: I think maybe you just said room, but maybe you meant the bedroom. Jonathan, is there any advantage to honing your skills in the fighting pits?
0:40:09: Dungeon Master: I think maybe you just said room, but maybe you meant the bedroom.
0:40:17: Speaker_2: Mostly for flair, but if you did it like every single time you made a point to tell me that you're going to go train, eventually you could have a benefit.
0:40:31: Speaker_3: If you really, really have a really weak side, like strength,  Okay, okay It's a churro buddy
0:40:38: Dungeon Master: Okay, okay It's a churro buddy
0:40:54: Speaker_3: Will our new commanding officer essentially give us the lowdown on the new mission? So I think we just need to decide how close we are to doing that when we leave the room.
0:41:08: Speaker_3: Well, let's talk to her first, because we probably have to walk past.
0:41:16: Speaker_4: We might as well just say hi.
0:41:22: Dungeon Master: You're talking with Sylvarius at this point. It's like, run on, dude. Anyway, your new officer, she's actually right there, and you're trying to point between the crowd, but there's a lot of people moving, so you don't know who she's talking about.
0:41:33: Dungeon Master: But it's like, her name is Leora. Leora Wagnar.
0:41:47: Dungeon Master: Anyway, uh, pretty hardcore. You're gonna like her He's like I fucking wish Donnie was here. They used to be old adventuring buddies. They know each other Anyway, she'll give you more of a rundown On your case.
0:42:00: Dungeon Master: She told me to watch out for you guys. So, uh Right on whenever you're ready
0:42:11: Dungeon Master: What was the last name?
0:42:19: Dungeon Master: Wagner?
0:42:22: Speaker_2: Okay.
0:42:24: Dungeon Master: Yeah, Leora. L-E-O-R. No, no, a nickname?
0:42:27: Speaker_2: No, no, a nickname?
0:42:32: Speaker_2: Yeah, I'm not going to do that.
0:42:33: Speaker_4: Yeah, I'm not going to do that.
0:42:40: Dungeon Master: collar and hooten sharing some people throwing in they have like side bets going where they're like getting some of their money just in between each other and you see two people fighting in the pit the first one is a dwarven woman she's got like a thick stubble on her face shaved half side of her head the other half is like wild and long bushy eyebrows piercing green eyes
0:42:50: Dungeon Master: obvious other heritage very dark skin she's got a nice like short cut fro it kind of goes fully like nice hairline it's not too back or anything um pretty fair woman um lithe form she's not overly muscular she looks more fast than anything very well wrapped fist just like from mid forearm all the way down past her  And then after, like, you hear somebody, like, rings the bell, just, ding, ding!
0:44:03: Dungeon Master: And she goes, whoo!
0:44:05: Dungeon Master: Sort of shakes out her hands, starts unwrapping, everybody's, like, patting her on the back. She's like, all right, all right, get back to fucking work. We got jobs to do. Christ's sake. And she looks, and she goes, ah!
0:44:18: Dungeon Master: My new recruits! Hard to wear in my manager. She, like, wipes some blood off her face, like, shit. She, like, wipes it on her tattered robe. She goes, um, I'm Leora.  about that space you guys pretty well familiarized and sorry I don't normally do this we're pretty chill up here you guys from what I know made your way up the ranks pretty quickly congrats thank you well sorry what do you not know names introductions not my thing I like to be on the streets still I'm very much not loving this position where they mostly political
0:45:05: Speaker_2: Oh, Leopold Magnus, at your service. She takes a look, she goes, he, she, they, person, non-person, like really looking in your ear.
0:45:11: Dungeon Master: She goes, huh, haven't seen someone like you.
0:45:15: Speaker_2: She goes, huh, haven't seen someone like you.
0:45:22: Speaker_2: Oh, oh, well, I do get that a lot. But I can assure you that I'm quite adept.
0:45:30: Speaker_2: It's almost everything everyone else does, except for eating. I haven't quite figured that one out.
0:45:35: Dungeon Master: Like I said, you guys, from the report I got from Captain Levi, you've been in the Legionnaire three weeks?
0:45:36: Speaker_2: Like I said, you guys, from the report I got from Captain Levi, you've been in the Legionnaire three weeks?
0:45:44: Dungeon Master: Already made Omen Knight? Specialty class? Good for you.
0:46:08: Dungeon Master: What do you guys do? I got a, I turn into a bear. Nice. Small people. She goes, huh, I turn into a panther, but not by choice.
0:46:41: Speaker_2: you don't know turning into a panther was not my choice i don't know what that means i think it always has to be lycanthropy which i thought was interesting
0:46:54: Speaker_2: Oh, me? Yes. Well, you know, I like to toy around with some things here and there. I'm not much for fighting. I don't really care for the... Like a moth does.
0:47:08: Speaker_2: You could say that. Hesitation catches me off guard.
0:47:13: Dungeon Master: Oh, sorry. Sorry for your loss. I'm farted by choice, quick moving, use my fists primarily, but I'm pretty good with a staff.  That's kind of my gist and she goes about sorry, but I'm we still technically actively patrol as well So this is my crew and you see some people have filtered in behind her That war been barbarian woman is in her crew apparently goes up. This is Brinya she  first, the axe points to her left behind. She goes, this is Melisra. We just call her Lisa. Sneaky type, also female. Dark skin, but a little more like ashen gray than like brownish. Hint of elven heritage, a little bit of point to her ears, black hair. Dark, stunning black armor, tight form, putting a lot of daggers on her belt. She just goes,  Too many daggers. And she goes, and where is, and then you see this little gnome runs through Leora's pants, so small, tiny little red hat, huge, what you know now to be the symbol of the tail, sort of the open palm, but not the curled fingers. She goes, name's Nim, just to one of you.
0:48:36: Dungeon Master: She goes, and I heal these fuckers.
0:48:41: Dungeon Master: pulls out a beard that's like the size of her body, just cracks it, starts chugging it, and goes, um, sorry, Brynja, you just lost me 40 gold, you fuck.
0:48:48: Dungeon Master: And then he goes, shush now, this is not the time.
0:48:54: Dungeon Master: Sorry, we still very much patrol the streets. Again, this maturity thing's not really our style.  Once there was a little bit of restructuring, and they said there had to be an officer of the Omen Knights, and we sort of took that as a little bit more pay, but we don't turn down cases.
0:49:16: Dungeon Master: Case in point, your case. Sorry, scattered brain. She goes, how about you make yourself comfortable in your new bunks? I will be there shortly. I know you got a brief rundown of what's been going on, but I've got a little bit of history with this kind of thing, so I will fill you in on things you need to know.
0:49:32: Dungeon Master: And then she sort of spins on her heel, and she goes, that's it, and walks away. But you see she walks to the bar, just like grabs a nail. The area that you had talked about, Smithy, before, part of that sort of counter space is like a working club for the All Midnight. It's like for some like downtime.
0:49:52: Dungeon Master: So it's like a little cafeteria and like a little place to eat.
0:49:52: Speaker_4: This is like a whole sort of like all-encompassing shared living space.
0:49:54: Dungeon Master: This is like a whole sort of like all-encompassing shared living space. Yeah, it's a soft serve machine.
0:49:57: Speaker_4: Yeah, it's a soft serve machine.
0:50:04: Dungeon Master: You walk into your space, and you see that it is very barren. Three beds for the three recruits, but nothing else. But it's a big space. You could put tables in here, couches. There's enough space in theory that you could put fighting dummies in here if you didn't want to use the communal ones. It's an open room for you guys to live in. It's much better. It's not just stacked bunks. You get more than just one little footlocker. It's a nice space.
0:50:38: Speaker_2: Sorry, oh you're going to have to get more protein in your diet. There's no spiders in here for you to eat And then after a little bit you guys are getting comfortable maybe putting some stuff up
0:50:49: Dungeon Master: Lera comes in. She's like leaning against the doorframe. She goes, um, right So I know you know the basis of this and we were on the other side of the market just
0:51:24: Dungeon Master: I have a history with this. A few years ago, first in the Legionnaire, there was a lycanthropy case in the Storm District. It tends to kind of be where it is, because the perpetuals or gloominess makes for odd sunlight hours. It's much more safer for them to roam. I had been tracking a, didn't know they were a lycanthrope, but a thief in the alleys.  didn't get here in time because it was a weird passage. There was no new moon right away, so long enough that it took hold and I lost the chance to sort of remove the curse from my body. So to speak, I've also read your file. I know you all are esoteric cursed, make you more adept fighters. I am not esoteric cursed, I am just cursed.  Yes, I end up killing I thought maybe if I killed the were panther I would turn back but uh not how this works not like vampires you see she goes so here's what you need to know if you get bit first 24 hours we can remove it no problem with the potion at your cost the medbay can do it if you Know you are cursed, but you haven't had your first treatment  from a high cleric at the medbay for a great cost. They don't have a lot of the clerics who can perform that, and the cost material components are pretty high. But as soon as you either have your first transformation or you bypass a weak, greater action will be required. There is possible reversals. If you let it go, it is permanent. So there's like a force level of one.
0:52:18: Speaker_3: Yes, I end up killing I thought maybe if I killed the were panther I would turn back but uh not how this works not like vampires you see she goes so here's what you need to know if you get bit first 24 hours we can remove it no problem with the potion at your cost the medbay can do it if you Know you are cursed, but you haven't had your first treatment
0:53:12: Dungeon Master: I don't know. I don't know.  She goes, and I've done a little bit of research in it. From what I understand, you manifest different animals. It's not always the one that bits you is what you turn into. I was bit by a were-rat, and I turned into a were-panther, and I couldn't tell you why. It feels like an upgrade. Nobody wants to be a were-rat.  Not great in battle. So now, every once in a while, you'll notice I go dark, I go missing for a while. I seclude myself to my room when I transform. Who do we report to whenever you transform? There'd just be a gap in the cases. Normally, people are working at that point. Captain Levi still oversees our section of the Legionnaire. Very good. So he'd give you something in that case. But for the Omen Knights, I'm still... It's one night every month or two months or so, depending on if it's fair, but...  when they took it down was and she sort of pulls up a map and she points to it and you see that it is a very similar location to where you were in the Storm District last time. So if this is the Storm District map instead or saying the core is here towards like the center and the Storm District is down here it was like you were way southern side last time she's telling you like somewhere in here there is like the siding that just had
0:55:10: Speaker_2: So one of these buildings here is Selina's potion shop.
0:55:13: Dungeon Master: Selina's salve. So it went club a couple streets down and then her was the very one on the corner, which is like why there was like a funicle tunnel that nobody noticed. Right.
0:55:23: Dungeon Master: The edge of the area. Very edge, right.
0:55:29: Dungeon Master: the last confirmed sighting and takedown of a lycanthrope was. What is this building?
0:55:34: Speaker_2: What is this building? This is a great, this is a great... What I originally made this map was for our in-person D&D session, so this was the Dawn District, and this was to the Graveyard Courtyard, but this is now the Storm District, and don't worry about that.
0:55:48: Speaker_2: Okay.
0:55:50: Speaker_2: And these buildings... Random buildings.
0:55:51: Speaker_2: Random.
0:55:54: Speaker_3: What is the moon phase?
0:56:25: Dungeon Master: Oh, any known weaknesses?
0:56:25: Speaker_2: Oh, any known weaknesses?
0:56:27: Speaker_2: Should we pack some silver with us, perhaps?
0:56:31: Dungeon Master: Silver weapons hinder the rejuvenation factor of a lycanthrope.
0:56:34: Dungeon Master: Magic weapons do damage. If you want to kill one outright, it has to be finished with silver weapons once downed. Otherwise, it would regenerate sometime later.
0:56:56: Dungeon Master: Last one, it seems to be mostly were-rats that are sort of coming out of the cities. I don't understand how large a were-rat was. Like five, six feet. Jesus! But rats can fit anywhere that their head can, so like it still can get into a pretty tight space if it needed to. So it's got the head that's like a foot wide, so even though it's like six feet tall.
0:57:23: Speaker_2: Do they sell some silvered weapons or are those available to us?
0:57:35: Dungeon Master: What's-his-butts-at-the-stand over there can get you some silvered powder? He doesn't sell silvered weapons. Does that mean we could coat the edge of a weapon with it? You could get like a one-time use. Exactly, yes, to finish it off.  you uh she looks at you guys she goes you guys all rock the magical gear though so i don't imagine you'd have trouble damaging it but yes get yourself some silver powder force it to ingest it upon death or make a final blow with it i don't have many months can we have seal of powder for the mission feels like part of the mission you should supply us with what we need to
0:58:09: Speaker_3: printed on syringe potions so that it would not have to charge you those fees. The ones in your suits weren't good enough? It's the only ones, we get crazy. Okay, well, we take down dragon.
0:58:27: Speaker_3: How do you think we got here in three weeks? Oh, oh, oh, Kaladin, let's, you know, just keep that, you know.
0:58:34: Dungeon Master: Did you get a horde or something like that? That's pretty stingy, I suppose. She goes, well, here, do you like, she's got a package, she pulls out, she has like some silver necklaces.
0:58:50: Dungeon Master: Do something with that. Your omen dice, for God's sake. Just like Mardi Gras.
0:58:53: Speaker_2: Just like Mardi Gras.
0:58:55: Dungeon Master: Not these. Just one lands on my neck, you know?
0:58:59: Dungeon Master: You can tell she probably, like, normally wears a silver necklace. But, like, since she was just fighting, she didn't have one. She's like, oh, fuck. Here you go. And she's like, this is not my... I guess I am your boss. I don't want to be your boss. Don't make me be your boss.
0:59:16: Dungeon Master: I'm just here to give advice to and give you payments.
0:59:27: Speaker_2: Well that's a pretty cool boss. I always like having cool bosses.
0:59:36: Speaker_3: Well, when you guys want to head out, you want to head out after tonight. You got stuff to do, don't you? You're going to all day it or all night it? All night. All nighter.
0:59:43: Speaker_2: All night. All nighter.
0:59:44: Speaker_3: Right. So it's mid-morning. Now it's noon. What time is it? Yeah. How long is this all day? I guess I'm just going to fire it off as soon as we get some.
0:59:45: Speaker_2: Right.
0:59:49: Speaker_2: I guess I'm just going to fire it off as soon as we get some. It's like noon-ish at this point.
0:59:51: Speaker_3: It's like noon-ish at this point. Down time.
0:59:52: Speaker_2: Down time. Yeah.
0:59:54: Speaker_3: So do you want to work on this thing for the next 10 hours, and then we try to search at night in the storm district to get a better idea of where?
1:00:05: Speaker_2: i guess yeah would i take a point of exhaustion if we did that you could push yourself harder to finish it before they go out and to go into the night with the point of exhaustion yes and then as soon as you sleep you'd lose it yeah so what we should probably do is we should probably sleep during the day i just need to meditate yeah and well yeah i need to sleep i'm actually
1:00:27: Speaker_4: from staying up at night. So I'll just go in there and I'll throw up some sheets around my bed and make it dark. And then I'll just go lie down.
1:00:37: Speaker_2: What's the point of exhaustion? What does that do? Disadvantage on ability checks.
1:00:39: Speaker_4: Disadvantage on ability checks.
1:00:40: Speaker_2: That's the first point.
1:00:40: Speaker_3: That's the first point. Not so bad. No. Yeah. Abilities and skill checks.
1:00:44: Speaker_2: Yeah. I'll do that. And then I guess I'll make the sword, presumably. What is the sword? What's the stats on it?
1:00:54: Dungeon Master: It'll be a...  You are not proficient in weapons, are you? I don't think so.
1:01:10: Dungeon Master: So what we would do when I actually build the weapon, when you roll high enough to complete it today, it'll be a finesse weapon that uses your intelligence modifier as the main stat for the weapon. To hit. Okay. Essentially, unless you want to change the way it presents in my head, lightsaber adjacent,  Long range weapon you can do axe, mace, sword, spear, however you want it to do. The main thing about the power core was sustained amount of power to project the energy to a certain point or fill a certain space without going over or going under. The design is really up to you. You took the blueprints of how to build the casing to make it work, but other than that, however you want it to look.
1:02:03: Dungeon Master: Once you built it that way, it'll stay that way, but you can build it in a different way. Would it be a magical?
1:02:06: Speaker_2: Would it be a magical? It would be magical because of its energy, so... It's like a lightsaber, but it's just like... Makes that noise.
1:02:07: Dungeon Master: It would be magical because of its energy, so... It's like a lightsaber, but it's just like... Makes that noise.
1:02:19: Dungeon Master: Okay.
1:02:22: Speaker_2: And then, what would the damage?
1:02:25: Dungeon Master: D8, because Finesse would be like the best, the greatest thing on that is at a rate
1:02:35: Speaker_2: It would be a 1d8 and then I guess well like my hand crossbows are like plus six like what's the? Proficiency bonus plus attack and I'd say it'd be like a plus one weapon.
1:02:41: Dungeon Master: So what is your intelligence modifier? Five. So one, six. Your proficiency bonus is three at this point. It'd be a plus nine to hit. And then a d8 plus five damage. And then if you wanted we could do fire damage. You could roll like a d4 fire damage.
1:03:08: Speaker_3: Did I give you the spear? Were you holding the spear? You might just take that back and see if Hamlock can eventually do something with it.
1:03:16: Speaker_2: Yeah, yeah. I haven't used it at all.
1:03:21: Dungeon Master: Okay. So you are crafting. You had an early enough roll that I'm not going to force it. You get a little tired at first, but you find your second wind pretty quickly and you start working on it. Um, and then like,  at this point and you finally finish it and as like it is like you're in the pocket workshop it's on these like forked stands in the middle the handle sort of looks like a lightsaber handle but as you finish it and Leopold sort of takes a step back what does it do?
1:03:58: Speaker_2: yeah so it is gonna take the form of a sword
1:04:02: Speaker_2: And the form factor of the power core is fairly small. It's like the size of an apple, I imagine. Or is it a little larger than that? However you want it to be.
1:04:12: Speaker_2: So the, okay. The power core is roughly the size of an apple.
1:04:18: Speaker_2: And that has been kind of crafted into a box that I attach onto my hip.
1:04:27: Speaker_2: There is a,
1:04:29: Speaker_2: cord that powers the hilt of the sword so that way the sword can never be, you know, basically removed from my person.
1:04:38: Speaker_2: And as you activate it, a large glowing beam of crackling red lightning shoots forth and kind of like almost like a scimitar hooks backwards.
1:04:56: Speaker_2: The color is a gradient of red to deep purple, and on its far edge, the backside of the blade, it wisps off into nothingness.
1:05:00: Speaker_2: So the front edge of the blade is a really blood red, and then it kind of wisps away into that violet.
1:05:23: Speaker_2: So yeah, I emerge from the pocket workshop and I just, you just start hearing this.
1:05:33: Speaker_2: And there's this dummy that was set up as like a little target practice, just like crumbles into a quarters, a pretty rude awakening for you.
1:05:46: Dungeon Master: You are in like your black curtains, just like you draped around your bed.  flash in burning intense red light of this curved blade. It's sort of a little unstable as he finds you. It's like throwing sparks here and there. It's just like, and your whole room goes red, just flaring up.
1:06:02: Dungeon Master: Well, it's about time for us to get up anyway, isn't it?
1:06:15: Dungeon Master: I figured as much, yeah.
1:06:16: Speaker_3: What has Callum been doing this time?  I think I probably would have spent some of that time practicing in the pits. Just because.
1:06:26: Speaker_3: Yeah. And then would have meditated for my four hours. Whatever it is, two hours. What do I need as an elf? Is it two? Four. Four? Damn, nice.
1:06:31: Speaker_2: Four. Four? Damn, nice. You're four, I got six hours. But I mean, I need to rest. I eat all eight. You eat all eight.
1:06:38: Dungeon Master: I eat all eight. You eat all eight.
1:06:46: Dungeon Master: which I think is the first time you guys have gone into anything with any sort of disadvantage so far, which is cool.
1:06:54: Dungeon Master: I got a badass sword, so let's fucking go.
1:06:54: Speaker_2: I got a badass sword, so let's fucking go.
1:06:57: Dungeon Master: Yeah, I already have a disadvantage on stealth, so, you know, it fits pretty well.
1:07:13: Speaker_2: Like what are those towers that you can charge up and if you touch it, it starts, yeah, you just hearing that like, yeah.
1:07:40: Dungeon Master: You guys, I imagine at this point we'll head out and let's see if there's something else you want to do. So you go into the Storm District, you know roughly the south side of town is where you want to head. Cool thing before that actually, as you guys are making your way out, you see it's like late at night, Leora's like getting ready for bed, she's like in her pajamas, she's got slippers on, she's like got like a cup of tea, she's walking out like heavily, she goes, oh shit, sorry.  You guys are so used to walking. Down the hall to the right, Omen Knights have access to teleportation circles for the city. Oh, damn. There are checkpoints on certain points of the wall that can take you to the districts. You still have to transverse the districts as normal, but it won't be as far south side to the core. You just make it to a wall and the wall will be able to teleport you back.
1:08:35: Dungeon Master: um good night she's 13 she keeps walking thank you leo what is it leora leora l works l even better excellent yes let us move to the circles short walk let's go you guys walk to a room and you almost get a moment of ptsd
1:09:05: Dungeon Master: established teleportation circle on the ground and he looks and he goes gentlemen and he goes starts plugging he's like where to?
1:09:32: Dungeon Master: No.
1:09:35: Dungeon Master: It'll be a little bit of a maybe a little bit of a head  It's almost like you're going two places at once. It's pretty crazy. You'll find out in a moment. Step into the circles. Arms and hands, arms and feet in the circle at all times. Do not jump out midway or you might get bisected. Safe travel. You see, channel some power into the circle. The circles are safe because they're established in two different directions, but you notice in a flash, light stretches. You feel like your body's go infinitely high while your feet hit the ground, and as soon  blood out of your head, everything, your feet come off the ground and they hit the ground again and you are on the top of the wall in the storm district. Again, the storm district is very classically rainy, gloomy, always sort of overcast, but it's dark at this point and it's not raining, you know it at this time, but through the peak of the clouds you can see an almost full moon in the sky, pretty bright coming through, so there's like moonlight letting  but from this viewpoint you're looking out over the dark city there's the arcane lights that sort of scatter to give like ambient light on the streets um the storm district has its own little flavor on them where the lights are like a little bit crackly lightning in there so you just see like a little bit of thrumming blue light that sort of lights the city up people go in tune from taverns things like that oh oh oh dear i think i was gonna be sick
1:11:11: Speaker_2: A giant rotisserie chicken hole just plops out of my headpiece.
1:11:15: Speaker_2: So it just kind of flips back. Chicken falls onto the ground. It's still warm.
1:11:58: Dungeon Master: He said we're on the wall. You're on the top of the wall looking so like it's core and then all the districts have the wall. So you are on the left wall of it looking into the city. So you need to go to like straight other side. Or you can tell Teddy and maybe he can get you to the other side of the wall.  Teleport again. He's a mage, right?
1:12:24: Speaker_2: I don't know about that.
1:13:00: Dungeon Master: You know pretty good. A quadrant maybe, yeah.
1:13:01: Speaker_2: A quadrant maybe, yeah. A couple of buildings. Do we want to sneak?
1:13:06: Speaker_4: Do we want to come up and play?
1:13:09: Speaker_3: Or do we want to just kind of...  we are in omen night armor i don't know if there's a lot of sneaking i think we just need to be quiet and observant potentially yeah there's some info armor is it like very bombastic it's very like loud colors or is it it's very black unless you customize it to be different yeah let's go down to the buildings where uh yeah where they were last spotted and maybe surveil the as we get closer and closer can i uh just
1:13:41: Dungeon Master: I'll do an investigation check. That's pretty good. I got a 25. 25, 25, 26.
1:14:15: Speaker_2: Where is its home?
1:14:16: Speaker_2: I was going to look for potential holes, or like you said, the rat can fit through a spot that's as big of its head. So I was kind of looking for maybe a burrow. You guys make your way to this strip that you had been on before.
1:14:25: Dungeon Master: You guys make your way to this strip that you had been on before. If you remember, there was a club at the northern side of the road that had a line coming out of it. You would talk to the bouncer who had given you some heads up, and that's when you would see those fungal creatures.  trying to drive that guy into Selena's shop. You're like walking down that strip. The club doesn't seem to be nearly as loud and bombastic. There's like some, a lot of noise on the inside, lights, people moving in, but there's nobody out of the door. So there's no bouncer on the outside, but you're like listening. And first thing you hear is like some skittering and some shuffling and like hard to describe other than like a dull thud being  hold around on the pavement like you can hear this skidding but it's like not dragging it's like shuffle back and forth weird to describe it like you hear something being moved around some like noise  from where you are you don't super know but then you see um like you're just looking around and then up down the street um up towards say where it would be saving the shop you see uh somebody walking and in a moment they're like with like their loved one and they just get like pummeled into an alleyway in an instant you see like something from the other side of the street push them to  out of view. We all check that. All of you see that as you're like, you hear something immediately to your left and then you make eye contact with these people. Just go in for a walk who were just in this moment assaulted. Okay.
1:16:09: Speaker_3: As an action, I'm going to go ahead and pull my mask out.
1:16:15: Speaker_3: Just everything gets a little bit brighter. And I'll go ahead and sprout our little flowers for communication. Did that get updated again? Didn't it lose like a little chunk of its energy? I don't know why it's gone, but I didn't put it in there. That's OK. That's the only thing that I think is not there. We're going to knock it off.
1:16:33: Speaker_2: I'm going to retract my steel defender out.
1:16:40: Speaker_2: Yeah. He kind of emerges from my back armor.
1:16:50: Speaker_4: And let's see...
1:16:55: Speaker_4: I want a giant orange tabby. Yes, a giant Garfield tabby. He's eating lasagna.
1:17:29: Speaker_4: So I'll just be like, all right, Garf. Be vigilant. We're looking for some rats. And then I'm going to wait to Wild Shape until we get a little closer. But we're all just going to, are we going to go for the noise that we heard? Or are we going to go for the people? Straight to the alley. Well, I guess so. How far away are the people, though?
1:17:46: Speaker_3: Straight to the alley.
1:17:46: Speaker_2: Well, I guess so. How far away are the people, though?
1:17:48: Dungeon Master: Because if the noise is really close and they're super far. They were in eyesight, so three blocks or so, but straight line.  around the corner of the clubhouse the other time. So 100 feet versus 300 feet kind of deal.
1:18:00: Speaker_3: Action and pedestrians versus sound. That's true. We should try to save those people. That's all it is really.
1:18:08: Speaker_4: Yeah, so let's just action dash get there as fast as we can. Sprinting, what's your guys' movements?
1:18:08: Speaker_3: Yeah, so let's just action dash get there as fast as we can.
1:18:16: Speaker_3: 30 with dash 60.
1:18:18: Speaker_3: Yeah, 60. So it'll take you a couple rounds to get there.
1:18:18: Dungeon Master: Yeah, 60. So it'll take you a couple rounds to get there.
1:18:29: Speaker_2: Save as me. Okay. Okay.
1:18:31: Dungeon Master: Here's a sprinting full speed.
1:18:38: Dungeon Master: Again, a couple rounds together. You skid, slide, and sort of the reins like streets of the cobblestone.
1:19:05: Speaker_2: behind in the alley.
1:19:06: Dungeon Master: You're running down the street parallel with the buildings. You turn the corner, this thing goes, whatever it is, up the building and then starts running back the way that you would come from. The alley.
1:19:18: Speaker_3: Can we send Garfield up the rooftop?
1:19:20: Speaker_3: Yeah, I'll send him. I'll tell him to follow that little thing.
1:19:20: Speaker_4: Yeah, I'll send him. I'll tell him to follow that little thing. And he's going to try to climb. It's technically a spirit.
1:19:53: Dungeon Master: It basically just flies, but it doesn't have the difficult terrain. It crests over the top, and you see, can you see from its view? It just knows. It sees like a dog-like form. What you see is like a werewolf versus kind of a were-other creature, bounding over the roof onto the next roof, heading back towards the way that you guys had come from. All right, yeah, I'll relay that and say hello.
1:20:31: Speaker_4: Going back where we came. Heading back down the valley again.  And so if it's got a 60 foot fly speed, could it catch this thing? Or is that thing faster?
1:20:45: Speaker_4: It's going to action dash. Also, he's not like running. If he's flying, he's just got his paws in like this. Just like a little potato. A little love.
1:21:12: Speaker_2: So it's running down the alley. Jonathan, is it anywhere on this map?
1:21:16: Dungeon Master: So if you guys are here and you turn this corner, it jumped onto this roof and is now on this building heading back to this way. Okay. So you guys come back in the street and chase it.  I could just have it use its action. So it's like 30 feet of building's width kind of behind and it is just following it. And we'll say it gives off a little bit of light if you like. So you're like on the ground chasing it from the street and you see the light of it kind of guiding you back. It's like a Thanksgiving Day parade. Yes. And it's like loafing through the air.  guys are chasing it and eventually it goes back to the alley that you would heard the noise from before and as you guys are like getting up to the corner maybe you slow your run got it ready you hear some like trash cans topple and then just like silence and the light comes down off the roof and then disappears into the ground because you didn't give it any other commands oh shit it disappears i'm gonna jump into that hole
1:21:24: Speaker_4: So you guys come back in the street and chase it.
1:22:48: Dungeon Master: Thirteen. Thirteen.
1:22:51: Dungeon Master: You don't see one immediately? Can I yell something?
1:22:57: Dungeon Master: Well, you don't have to yell. We've got the flower. No, it's for Garfield.
1:23:01: Dungeon Master: Oh, Garfield.
1:23:02: Speaker_4: Garfield, meow!
1:23:20: Dungeon Master: I'm gonna do an investigation or does that have to be a perception? Perception? Four. I'm not getting anything.
1:23:38: Speaker_2: Can I go ahead and do an investigation check now?
1:23:40: Speaker_2: Try to more thoroughly look for...
1:23:41: Dungeon Master: Try to more thoroughly look for...
1:23:54: Speaker_3: where we got this the intro where the thing disappeared let me see here what is that whoops investigation 17 yeah um eventually you do find at the base of the building some of the brick and mortar has been pushed out and the ground has been dug away it was sort of like there was a pile of trash bags and it had gone like
1:24:15: Dungeon Master: I think I found it, but perhaps there's another entrance inside.
1:24:34: Speaker_3: It's the club building.
1:24:36: Speaker_2: The foundational club building.
1:24:36: Speaker_3: The foundational club building.
1:24:38: Speaker_2: Well, I've had some experience in that establishment and I can't say it was a great time.
1:24:42: Speaker_2: You were in there before.
1:24:49: Speaker_2: So some weird business happening in there.
1:24:51: Speaker_4: So the whole...  that we found is too small for a person.
1:24:59: Speaker_3: It's like 18 inches and we're all 24 at the shoulders.
1:25:13: Speaker_4: Okay.
1:25:15: Speaker_4: So yeah, we got the ID. Well, this thing wasn't
1:25:19: Speaker_3: Why can't there be?
1:25:21: Speaker_3: Yeah, but would it be able to fit in this hole? It was a dog, small dog. Small dog. It was a small dog? Oh, I thought it was huge.
1:25:27: Speaker_4: Oh, I thought it was huge.
1:25:27: Dungeon Master: It was dog-like form, but it wasn't a big creature. Dog-like.
1:25:31: Speaker_4: Okay, alright. So we're thinking, get down to the building, and I'm gonna run up the hole, and I'm gonna yell as loud as I can.
1:25:36: Speaker_4: It's probably way too late by now.
1:25:42: Speaker_4: Gar, come back.
1:25:44: Speaker_4: Gar, come back to me.
1:25:47: Dungeon Master: It's bonded to you?
1:25:51: Dungeon Master: right yeah it does whatever i say recall yeah just eventually there's like just squirting out of that hole like two things a couple minutes go behind you see the lights filter out gradually i was like spiritual cat i'm gonna let my hand a little bit
1:26:23: Dungeon Master: It was like a rave event. It was body-to-body packed, couldn't make out anything. As you guys go into the building this time, it is much less busy.
1:26:35: Dungeon Master: There are people here chatting.
1:26:40: Dungeon Master: It is not like a slow night by any means.
1:26:48: Speaker_2: What what what's the day of the night Okay, and it's what 8 9 p.m.
1:26:48: Dungeon Master: What what what's the day of the night Okay, and it's what 8 9 p.m.
1:26:51: Dungeon Master: Okay, so you guys
1:26:57: Dungeon Master: You come in through the entrance here. There are tables set up. This is normally a huge floor with like a dance stage up here. When you would come in before, you would like make it a big room and there would be a huge thing going on here, but there is a nice bar. There's a back room like porch patio thing. You see a couple tables, people playing card games, drinking games. There's like an established game right here.  Fire pit people are chatting. It is not empty. It's still kind of busy, but it's not shoulder-to-shoulder.
1:27:28: Speaker_2: This is inside.
1:27:29: Dungeon Master: Yes fire pit inside Is this what is this little?
1:27:34: Dungeon Master: Barrels and one of them toppled over. Okay. Nice.
1:27:38: Speaker_2: Nice.
1:27:39: Speaker_3: There's a toppled over beer can right here. Let me go speak to the bartender.
1:27:42: Speaker_2: Let me go speak to the bartender.
1:27:45: Speaker_3: Yeah.  get a drink while you're at it you walk in as you sort of like dust off some of like it had lightly started raining at some point past pretty quickly so you're not like soaking wet but shake your shoulders some of the water come up people start like making eye contact with you the police are essentially your kind of deal but you notice that
1:27:52: Dungeon Master: lingering gazes because of my elf form nothing obvious nobody's really paying that close of attention get your gas mask on don't you yeah you're like it does have a mask on a little more intimidating you can be a yeah give me a perception check to see if anybody's just staring and i'm gonna roll to see if somebody is staring
1:28:34: Dungeon Master: You would be looking but as soon as you walk in you hear a voice Right to your guys's left and the very familiar Handsome short thick but full nicely groomed beard. Oh  that you and I met before is like, got a lot of jewelry. He's like, hey guys, welcome back. It's been some time.
1:29:07: Dungeon Master: You guys look a little bit healthier, a little bit stronger, love that. Yes, look Brock, we need to speak to whoever owns the establishment.
1:29:12: Speaker_3: Yes, look Brock, we need to speak to whoever owns the establishment. Oh, you guys are on duty.
1:29:22: Dungeon Master: Yeah, go see,
1:29:33: Dungeon Master: He's like sitting on his chair like legs for like Solomon's work in the bar tonight I'm gonna filter off as people are walking.
1:29:45: Speaker_2: What kind of card games do we have going on? Walk in you're talking with them you look across you see a very large muscular and sort of very heavy just like full-figured
1:29:51: Dungeon Master: Walk in you're talking with them you look across you see a very large muscular and sort of very heavy just like full-figured  Man, huge beard, wild hair, seems to be running like an arm wrestling table for money, and he seems to be running the floor with everybody. He is winning back to back, sort of like some gold to get in, see if you can beat him, you can take some money back.
1:30:24: Dungeon Master: There is a drinking game at these tables. You see people are just kind of going at it.  Everybody's in good spirit about it. And then over here seems to be like an actual organized dice game where people are just rolling to see who can beat. You don't really understand the rules yet, but it's definitely got money involved in it. Gambling, a lot of fun. So there's not a lot of strategy from first glance with the dice.
1:30:46: Speaker_2: So there's not a lot of strategy from first glance with the dice. It's just kind of rolling. Seems like a game of luck, buying.
1:30:51: Dungeon Master: Seems like a game of luck, buying.
1:30:53: Dungeon Master: And then you do hear a lot of commotion out sort of in the back, but you can't see it because the door's closed. Got it.
1:31:01: Speaker_2: okay well i guess with that passing observation i'll just kind of stick with the uh the squad yeah well he's going over to talk to us on this radio in that like maybe we should send somebody to go pick up those dead bodies there you go like let them know we are on we are on lead yeah yeah we are responding some new dead bodies
1:31:22: Dungeon Master: You hear that, um, you recognize the voice as being... I think I said it was Nim. Nim, the gnome that sort of was part of Leora's group, goes, Oh, yeah, that's kind of unfortunate. You guys lost one on the first night. Weird, awkward silence. She goes, Just fucking with you. I'll send out some people in a moment. Keep us updated, obviously.
1:31:51: Dungeon Master: That one's testy.
1:31:52: Dungeon Master: Hello, Solomon.
1:31:57: Dungeon Master: You walk to the bar, you see a taller man. Again, everybody here has got more of like a Scandinavian theme. It would be like large beers, lots of jewelry, like unnecessary furs at this point.  he pours some more beer some other people and he goes hey we have a few questions we need to know is there a basement and have you seen any unusual animals lately there is yes a basement it's around the corner is
1:32:37: Dungeon Master: I'd have to talk with the owner about just letting in some Legionnaires, understandably, but he's not really keen on you guys, gonna be honest.
1:32:52: Speaker_3: I understand this. They are wanted in murderers. Perhaps this changes your mind. There's always murderers. Being sort of like, I guess I could be swayed. I just give him a high five.
1:33:09: Speaker_3: I have no cash.
1:33:12: Dungeon Master: I'm absolutely zeroed. I'm on the edge of the bar. Hey, take the water off. It goes right through it. He goes, um, sorry, rules are rules, guys. I wish I could buy, uh, if you get some coin, you can buy your way to the back and sneak in, but I can't just let you into the cellar. You, uh, you're not allowed in there.
1:33:35: Speaker_3: Cool. They are now in your basement. This is why I wouldn't need you in there. Perhaps you'd like to interact with the were-dog.
1:33:51: Speaker_3: Give me an insight check.
1:33:54: Dungeon Master: Can I participate in this?
1:33:56: Dungeon Master: No. No? You're not in the conversation. I'm not there? You are, but he is leading and he is talking. That's fair.
1:34:03: Dungeon Master: Guidance. Guidance?
1:34:06: Dungeon Master: He's not being entirely truthful about knowing versus not knowing that there was a hole on the side of the building. But he's not giving you any more ground on that. I telepathically say, I don't believe him, he knows of the hole.
1:34:26: Speaker_4: As a, just a, above table thing, do we have to like...
1:34:35: Speaker_3: Yeah, yeah. We didn't go. We do whatever the hell we need. We are the authority. We got the law, right? We're not just missionaries. Do you know that there are bouncers guarding this?
1:34:37: Dungeon Master: Yeah, yeah. We didn't go. We do whatever the hell we need. We are the authority. We got the law, right? We're not just missionaries. Do you know that there are bouncers guarding this? This is a little more exclusive back area. But he's like, if you get back there and you get into the basement, I'm not going to stop you. But he's like, I'm not supposed to let people in there. Gotcha.
1:34:55: Speaker_4: I'm going to say I don't think we should just let this push through. I think we should just go and just say, hey, we don't want to.
1:35:05: Speaker_2: Well, what is this? What is this guy's name?
1:35:05: Speaker_4: Well, what is this? What is this guy's name?
1:35:08: Speaker_2: Solomon. Before we try that, I'll appeal to Solomon. I'll say, oh, Solomon, well, you know, it couldn't be good for business if your patrons found out you have an infestation of
1:35:20: Speaker_2: you know infected creatures here so well I'm just saying we're here we're going to provide our services of extermination for free okay so up to you you win some coin you buy your way into the exclusive lounge don't fucking play the game they have in there whatever you could bypass that most people are pretty
1:35:43: Dungeon Master: phantasmal fighting hit but um they won't be watching you you could probably just sneak into the cellar but um  Well there's a fighting pit here too?
1:35:58: Speaker_3: Well there's a fighting pit here too? It's in the auditorium. There's other activities.
1:36:04: Speaker_2: Oh, okay. Yes, of course. Well, I could spin my way up on the stage belting some lines out if any of these patrons here would... Normally I would, but there's a show going on in a couple minutes actually.
1:36:18: Speaker_2: Oh, well, mere loss. Okay.
1:36:21: Dungeon Master: Yeah.
1:36:22: Dungeon Master: Do the board, do you see there is a very, like, up band?  Simple, people, like lots of furs, they're very much embracing the theme of the bar. If you haven't been here really before, you don't know if there's like a regular or not, but there's a humanoid looking woman. She's getting ready to put on her set. She's got like, you know, equivalent of like a tambourine, kind of, she sets up. Somebody's actively setting up on the stage. Like a little folk here, or do we, can we get a read on the genre?
1:36:46: Speaker_2: Like a little folk here, or do we, can we get a read on the genre? Okay, got it.
1:36:48: Dungeon Master: Okay, got it. Stick around long enough to hear it.
1:36:52: Speaker_3: Let's go talk to the bouncers. Do we need to bribe them or can we just push past them?
1:36:56: Speaker_4: Do we need to bribe them or can we just push past them?
1:36:58: Speaker_4: I think, yeah. Yeah, I think we could just murder these people and I think we'll be fine.
1:36:59: Speaker_3: Yeah, I think we could just murder these people and I think we'll be fine.
1:37:05: Dungeon Master: Turn the corner, two very large men, both about 6'5", very muscular, very hardened faces, look at you, see that they don't recognize you and go... Yes, I just unsheathed my sword.
1:37:23: Speaker_3: You know the bouncer yeah, oh yeah, I reveal my sword goes Ah 16 plus 17
1:38:03: Speaker_2: Sheath my lightning sword.
1:38:10: Dungeon Master: But you guys make your way to this back room. This back room is dark, poorly lit, but you see flashes of neon blue.  over a crowd of 100 people crowding very closely around this thing and as you're walking by you see Cellar doors on the left wall to the ground On the right you see some guy leading some sort of bedding ring and there are You see like glass orbs in everybody's hands They're kind of like in a line and you see that they very much are like two people staying on the side  Animal of some kind the other person throws out and it projects an animal and then their animals fight as they like place bets on it But as you guys make your way to the cellar to work Where do you get an orb?
1:39:04: Dungeon Master: You go to the cellar and you don't want to play the games that's fine You uh, it's not locked. It's inside the buildings. They don't feel like the need to like  As you were making your way down the stairs you hear like the the woman give an introduction of her group and everything And then she starts singing so that the whole music of the whole area changes As she starts doing like the performance in the background as you guys make your way underneath the building You are in the cellar. It's pretty dark. There's no traditional arcane lamp down here But you see there are some torches that you can light on the wall if you'd like With your immediate darkvision  shelves some barrels that are tapped you see the ones in the wall have a line going up to the top probably to the bar itself  Do we see any, like, claw marks or signs that something feral has, like, gone through here?
1:40:20: Speaker_4: You got drool, blood.
1:40:23: Speaker_3: You got drool, blood.
1:40:23: Speaker_3: Yeah, drool. Dove throats.
1:40:24: Speaker_4: Yeah, drool. Dove throats.
1:40:25: Speaker_4: Claws.
1:40:26: Dungeon Master: You check, like, the walls of the room, and you see that there's not a break in the wall to this room, so whatever the tunnel was bypasses. As you're searching, give me another round of investigations is what this would be more like. Would these creatures be magical?
1:40:40: Speaker_2: Would these creatures be magical?
1:40:43: Dungeon Master: Well, I have this as ritual I can cast detect magic what is that?
1:40:44: Speaker_2: Okay
1:40:45: Speaker_3: Okay
1:41:05: Dungeon Master: You walk in technically on this the west side and I said it was on the other it's on the east side So you go around behind the stairs that you came in on you see there's like some freshly upturned dirt underneath Freshly relative, but it's not flat patted down You were digging in and you see that it's filled as far as you can tell  But it's not packed. So you're digging, and it's like you're digging into a hole, but it's really easy to dig in. You figure if you had a way to mass remove dirt, that you might breach into a tunnel at some point.  If it's spiritual is that material What's the duration on this it's an hour Seems a little broken so far, but that's an hour spot.
1:41:56: Dungeon Master: We'll say 20 minutes in so in your head about a third of the way through but yes Garfield just starts digging
1:42:16: Speaker_4: Commit us to 20 minutes. No, 20 minutes is already gone by.
1:42:20: Dungeon Master: No, 20 minutes is already gone by. Oh, oh, oh, gotcha. So you're about a third away through the spell, but you can just commit it to do that. And as it's digging through, eventually you find that it breaks through the top of the dirt, and you can move enough dirt that, yeah, there is a person-sized hole that goes into the ground.
1:42:46: Speaker_4: going down yes it looks like we're going down all right i'll have garfield go first uh give me a little light because i don't have dark vision and i'll just start crawling uh the direction i'll tell him to go the direction that he came from because i assume he bent over here right
1:43:02: Speaker_4: You I don't know if you've got like a direct communication line with it, but this is not the same tunnel I'll try to tell him to go the way he came You tell him to go the same way and he goes down for what and he gives you a weird look and shrugs its cat Shoulders like I've never seen this before and it doesn't take you long to figure out that this was like
1:43:29: Dungeon Master: Seems like this was a tunnel that was being used that is no longer the main way, so they closed it off. So this will lead you into the tunnel network right underneath this. You don't know where it leads necessarily, likely the right place, but this is not his tunnel.
1:43:46: Dungeon Master: Well, he's trucking, so we should be crawling.
1:43:51: Dungeon Master: You're going to have to drop into this space.
1:44:05: Speaker_4: Yeah, the Spirit's really helpful. I got it to help in combat.
1:44:08: Dungeon Master: So you guys drop in here.
1:44:18: Dungeon Master: Now can we stand or are we crawling? It is hard for you to stand all the way up. You are hunched forwards at all times. If you were normal height, under 6'6", you'd be close, but you could make your way pretty easy.  Yeah, I'm fairly tall. Yeah, I'm fairly large. 6'11. 455 pounds. I'm a big boy. My skin is made out of hardened steel.
1:44:34: Speaker_3: Yeah, I'm fairly large. 6'11. 455 pounds. I'm a big boy. My skin is made out of hardened steel.
1:45:06: Speaker_2: Let's see.
1:45:12: Speaker_2: So, he can stay there until we're ready to have a barrel on him.
1:45:13: Speaker_3: The inanimate object. Does he have to stay 20 feet back?
1:45:16: Speaker_4: Does he have to stay 20 feet back?
1:45:18: Speaker_3: Pretty much.
1:45:21: Speaker_3: I feel like my own stealth is all right Well, if we really wanted to I could I could burn the password I mean I could drop the beast, but we can keep using the beast.
1:45:29: Speaker_3: He'll be a third. Yeah Yeah, well the thing that it seems really like really awesome, but it's ace AC is 11 plus the spell level so it's 13
1:45:37: Speaker_4: Yeah Yeah, well the thing that it seems really like really awesome, but it's ace AC is 11 plus the spell level so it's 13
1:45:48: Speaker_2: What's its damage?
1:45:51: Speaker_2: What's its damage do?
1:45:53: Dungeon Master: 1d8 plus 4 plus the spell's level in piercing damage.
1:45:57: Speaker_4: And then it's my spell attack to attack.
1:46:01: Speaker_4: That's basically my steel defender.
1:46:05: Speaker_2: That's basically my steel defender. I mean, it can do a little bit more.
1:46:09: Speaker_4: Well, I gotta burn the second spell every time.
1:46:11: Speaker_2: Yeah, okay.
1:46:14: Speaker_3: Can we, can everybody just sort of just like slowly like pad forward? Can we ask Leopold to not move? Oh shit. I guess it doesn't matter.
1:46:34: Speaker_2: For what?
1:46:36: Speaker_2: Oh, yeah. I'm already, can you get double disadvantage?
1:47:11: Dungeon Master: Overall, I need quiet. We'll just see if you get noticed.
1:47:17: Dungeon Master: Nothing immediately. You're making your way down this tunnel system. Your vision only goes so far. But eventually, you get on this corner, and you hear movement down sort of this way, as you're sort of at this corner. Leifold is still at the entrance.
1:47:52: Speaker_2: Bren, you have dark vision, right? I have dark vision. Nice. Yeah, I've got it too, so. Although, I'm not anywhere close to you guys.
1:48:40: Speaker_3: I think maybe I just put it there. The mask, yeah, maybe just plugged it over there. Again, I don't know where it went.
1:48:51: Dungeon Master: So just Kaladin is what we have then.
1:48:57: Speaker_4: Well, I'll stay with him. I mean, as far as I know myself is good. I'm just not going to get all the way up around the corner.
1:49:03: Speaker_2: Says Kaladin, who are these?
1:49:05: Speaker_4: The cat.
1:49:06: Speaker_2: Yeah, the cat will just be floating right behind me now.
1:49:06: Speaker_4: Back here a little bit.
1:49:10: Dungeon Master: I want to be close enough that I can help. You see movement down here. You've got dark vision to 60. I think even further now with the mask on. Going to 90, didn't it? Yeah.
1:49:20: Speaker_2: Yeah. Jesus.
1:49:21: Dungeon Master: Jesus.
1:49:21: Dungeon Master: Dark vision is grayscape vision. It's not color in the dark. I still see figures. So you see dark shapes. And you see two forms sort of moving back on here.
1:49:24: Speaker_3: I still see figures.
1:49:32: Dungeon Master: And one of them, really low to the ground, moving, like, mid-walk, and it's like all four, stands up and shifts into a humanoid, shakes off, sort of like, digs something. You see, like, its leg comes up, like, really dexterous, sort of, like, at its ear. Inhuman form.
1:50:03: Dungeon Master: You can do advantage because of your ears. Your long ears give you a little bit of a bonus.
1:50:14: Speaker_3: That's a 16 plus 5, 21. Nice. You do hear, it's like broken at this point, but one of the voices is familiar, one of them is not.
1:50:25: Dungeon Master: One of the voices you just hear is, good hunt.
1:50:32: Dungeon Master: Love that.  I think maybe I've come across that guy before.
1:50:44: Dungeon Master: I don't think I was there for that interaction.
1:51:01: Speaker_2: Kaladin came and rescued me from the, uh... So what would it be to recognize?
1:51:07: Dungeon Master: Uh, I rolled an 18. Sounds like the voice of Terrence. That little, like, scruffy dwarf kid who had the fake vampire teeth, and he was getting scared a lot. In line. That's what I thought the voice was. He was, like, free of Jason, and he had, like, fake teeth.  He was brightening up on Leopold. Yeah.
1:51:17: Speaker_3: In line. That's what I thought the voice was. He was, like, free of Jason, and he had, like, fake teeth.
1:51:27: Speaker_2: Trying to get me to do some drugs. Yeah.
1:51:28: Dungeon Master: Yeah.
1:51:29: Dungeon Master: Is this model after someone you went to high school with?
1:51:32: Dungeon Master: No?
1:51:33: Dungeon Master: Isn't there a kid named Terrence's?
1:51:33: Dungeon Master: There was. And he was weird, but no. I love that.
1:51:49: Speaker_3: Maybe. Are we related to this VR telepathic model?
1:51:54: Speaker_3: So he probably got bit on purpose, you little freak.
1:52:03: Speaker_3: Oh, dear. I wouldn't call him my friend. Perhaps it's the curse. There's another two, so I only see two people. Yeah.
1:52:19: Speaker_3: At this point, trying to be stealthy, you need to be giving me a new check. Otherwise, you can get up to the corner. Up to that point. What are you calling that? Like 25, 20 feet? What are you calling that? Yeah. What's another turn to get close enough? What's our final distance going to be if we get to right here?
1:52:43: Dungeon Master: 50, 60 feet across? This is 30 feet to the corner is how I had it. OK. So like 30 feet, 60 feet. And that would be like 100 feet. Are both of them going to be within 30 feet, or is one of them going to be further? There's somewhere in here.  You are not there yet, you are walking up, so you don't have eye contact with them. You don't know where they are in the room, but you hear them talking.
1:53:05: Speaker_2: So, would it be safe for me to approach now that they've kind of cleared this cavern, or would that still be... As soon as you start moving, you need to give me a stop there.
1:53:12: Dungeon Master: Wait, we'll tell you when to move, Leopold.  30 feet, 20 feet, and then another 30 feet. You are 80 feet.
1:53:23: Speaker_3: You take a while to catch up. You take one round to get into battle range.
1:53:25: Dungeon Master: You take a while to catch up.
1:53:33: Speaker_3: OK. And above you, you're still close enough, you do hear the music playing.
1:53:33: Dungeon Master: So the band is singing. Oh, so that's covering sound-wise.
1:53:40: Dungeon Master: Yes, there's a lot of noise.  You got there early at the night. You think like the main act is starting and you hear like a lot of people moving. There's like, it's mostly cavern space, but occasionally you'll see like a wooden floorboard that like people shuffle over and dust filters in. Yeah. All right. I think with that, I'm just going to try and get, get here.
1:53:56: Speaker_2: All right. I think with that, I'm just going to try and get, get here. Close at least 30 feet.
1:54:00: Dungeon Master: Give me a stealth check with this advantage.
1:54:09: Speaker_2: uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
1:54:41: Dungeon Master: And you hear, hey guys, how's it going?
1:54:44: Dungeon Master: Out of nowhere, they're having a conversation, he goes, and the other one goes, wait, I think someone's here.
1:54:53: Dungeon Master: Coming around the corner, you see Terrence so sweaty, his hair's like matted, his like spotty beard is like matted to his face and he's got some blood around his mouth.  Um, he looks more muscular. He's got no clothes other than like a leotard on at this point. Um, he was just a chubby, undefined, unathletic person before. He's got like pecs in like a pot ab belly where it's like muscular, but he's still not trying very hard. And he goes, as you come to meet your demise.
1:55:37: Dungeon Master: What noise?
1:55:55: Speaker_2: Don't move for a while, everything just stiffens up.
1:56:03: Speaker_3: Jesus.
1:56:05: Speaker_3: Jonathan, what happened?
1:56:10: Speaker_3: Would I have access to that spell we talked about?
1:56:14: Dungeon Master: that you would know, but if you tried to do it, it would manifest if you wanted it to.
1:56:19: Speaker_3: OK, then maybe not yet. Can I close the distance on this? Is this a re-rolling initiative now that they've seen us? So far, he hasn't just attacked you.
1:56:26: Dungeon Master: So far, he hasn't just attacked you. He's talking. He's speaking into the dark. He probably has dark vision. He can see forms, but he doesn't know what's going on. So he's sort of buying time, maybe.
1:56:37: Dungeon Master: He's talking to you guys.
1:56:43: Dungeon Master: Even if we didn't think this guy was killing people, we should probably kill him anyway.
1:56:50: Dungeon Master: He's got a curse.
1:56:51: Speaker_2: Also, I have the steel defender there.
1:56:51: Speaker_3: Also, I have the steel defender there.
1:56:55: Speaker_3: We need to kill this guy.
1:56:58: Speaker_3: Yeah, I think I would just get the jump on him. Yeah. Can I go ahead and just cast Chromatic Orb at first level?
1:57:05: Speaker_3: Yeah.
1:57:06: Speaker_3: Just reaction blast him.
1:57:07: Speaker_3: Terrence is getting fucked.
1:57:16: Speaker_3: That's going to be a 16 to hit.
1:57:20: Speaker_3: 16 hits.
1:57:36: Speaker_3: It's fine.
1:57:40: Speaker_3: We'll say, can it be one of six damages? We'll just say it's- You can just choose which damage type it is. We'll just say fire damage.
1:57:51: Dungeon Master: you throw and the fire as it like shoots through the air lights the perimeter of the tunnel as it travels through a little bit behind the plastic and he's like in the middle of this weird monologue that he did not burn the right people
1:58:19: Dungeon Master: As smoke and ember comes off his shoulder, and you hear the other broom goes, oh, what the fuck? And you don't see anything, but you hear, like, skin-tearing sounds, just like, as this other broom comes into place, you hear a heavy thud with, like, snorting sounds.
1:58:42: Dungeon Master: He's a were-pig?
1:58:43: Speaker_2: Were-boar. Thank you. Were-boar.
1:58:56: Speaker_2: I have a disadvantage on initiative as well. Yes.
1:58:59: Speaker_2: On everything.
1:59:04: Speaker_2: Let's see. Oh, ten. Yeah, plus two. Twelve.
1:59:13: Speaker_2: It's too bad I went at 21.
1:59:16: Speaker_2: Well, I guess I wouldn't have rolled two dice.
1:59:57: Dungeon Master: He's like cleaning himself. First up, initiative 22. He's choking on a hairball.
2:00:03: Speaker_3: And little Terrence hasn't switched forms yet.
2:00:06: Speaker_3: He's on the ground smoking at this point.
2:00:09: Dungeon Master: Smoke him while he's down.
2:00:40: Speaker_2: Yeah, were they just sitting around in a completely dark cavern, talking to each other, completely blind? When he walked in, they had been in different forms, and they'd just transformed back to their human ones.
2:00:44: Dungeon Master: When he walked in, they had been in different forms, and they'd just transformed back to their human ones.
2:00:52: Speaker_2: They hadn't lit any torches yet. Nothing yet. Got it. He's on his way to the light of inspiration.
2:00:53: Dungeon Master: Nothing yet.
2:00:58: Speaker_2: They just sit around in pitch blackness, talking to each other.
2:01:05: Dungeon Master: This is not exact you don't know where this guy is you've heard something behind the corner, but you can't see that's fine I'm gonna do just that I'm gonna poke my head the rest away around the corner Turning the corner you've got dark vision you see full charge not having taken a turn yet, but in the action of speed
2:01:19: Dungeon Master: grow on monsters this is like that but just exacerbated lit but all of its features are
2:02:35: Speaker_3: I guess the extent of strength they're going to be there.
2:02:42: Speaker_3: Now I'm also concentrating on that, so I'll have to remember that. Yes.
2:02:47: Dungeon Master: Terrence on the ground.
2:02:47: Speaker_3: Strength, save. It's just the restrained condition is what it looks like. Fails. Great. Other figure.
2:02:53: Dungeon Master: Fails. Great. Other figure.
2:02:59: Dungeon Master: It's a save. 18 plus 3, 21. Passes.
2:03:10: Speaker_3: Does that stack there's two difficult trains on top of each other it's just flat It's in a full
2:03:21: Dungeon Master: fully gets entangled on the ground, does not save on that.
2:03:48: Dungeon Master: Next up is, is that the end of your turn? Yeah, it's the end of that one. Okay, the boar. You see it will keep in its orc form.
2:04:05: Speaker_3: I think it's every time it's in
2:04:10: Speaker_3: Each creature other than myself must succeed on a strength saving throw within the area or have a restraining condition until the spell ends.
2:04:12: Speaker_3: A restraining creature can take an action to roll a strength or athletic check against the spell DC on a success and freeze itself from the plants and is no longer restrained by them but still
2:04:34: Speaker_2: What is the restrained condition? It's essentially zero movement speed. But you can still attack? It attacks on creatures other than what's restraining it or disadvantaged.
2:04:39: Dungeon Master: It attacks on creatures other than what's restraining it or disadvantaged. So it can attack the vines, a regular, or everybody else at disadvantage. So you said you're here, it's like 20 feet, but it's like 20 feet to you. So does it make a new save at the start of this turn?
2:04:58: Dungeon Master: If it's entering. Technically, you cast it to have it hit, so it's already in it.
2:05:00: Speaker_3: No, so then I'd say it's already past it. The plants will no longer try to entangle it, from what I understand. It has 40 feet. Perfect.
2:05:08: Dungeon Master: It has 40 feet.
2:05:34: Dungeon Master: So give me a DC 13 strength save or be knocked prone, but it also rolled a hit for the attack.
2:05:34: Speaker_4: So give me a DC 13 strength save or be knocked prone, but it also rolled a hit for the attack.
2:05:41: Dungeon Master: That's a hit, right?
2:05:43: Dungeon Master: Assume if it misses, then you'll just miss this, yeah. That's a 3 plus 5, does an 8 hit. Negative. So the charge doesn't do anything extra, because it misses that, but it'll do... You said a strength check? Yeah, you don't have to make it, because it makes two attacks, only one of which
2:06:19: Speaker_4: You didn't put the shield up right away, just missed.
2:06:23: Speaker_4: We'll do it later.
2:06:27: Dungeon Master: Next up is Terrence. You see on the ground, just, oh, fuck.
2:06:37: Dungeon Master: Prepare to take me at my worst. And you see, just gets a little bit taller and turns into a...  to do it.
2:07:10: Dungeon Master: I don't think I don't think they can free themselves by hacking
2:07:20: Dungeon Master: at the same time, he's fully laying prone still at this point. He cannot get up after that as a vehicle.
2:07:32: Speaker_3: at the same time, he's fully laying prone still at this point.
2:07:42: Speaker_2: So, I was going to say, what did we say, 30? 30 feet to like where I am.
2:07:49: Speaker_3: To the corner. When you get back to Garfields, you're 30. Oh, OK. So, and.
2:07:53: Speaker_2: My still defender has slightly further. He has 40 feet.
2:08:03: Speaker_3: So I'll get here and still defender can be there.
2:08:04: Speaker_2: Is that 10 feet?
2:08:10: Speaker_3: Okay.
2:08:11: Speaker_2: Halfway between them. I don't know what, what's a typical reach five feet. So he's still 10 feet away.
2:08:26: Speaker_2: With my attack I will do All creatures, so I don't want to do that
2:08:41: Speaker_2: I will cast Ray of Frost on Terrence.
2:08:49: Speaker_2: Little Terry.
2:08:51: Speaker_3: He is prone to all disadvantage.
2:08:53: Speaker_2: So it would be... Oh, for being prone?
2:08:56: Speaker_3: Yeah. Oh! Because it's like a smaller space. Ah, I didn't know that. Okay.
2:09:02: Speaker_2: Ah, I didn't know that. Okay. Then I'll go after the board. What's really funny is that he's like 10 feet away and you're like, shoot man up.
2:09:06: Speaker_4: Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's like laying on the ground.
2:09:09: Speaker_2: Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's like laying on the ground.
2:09:13: Speaker_2: So with my action, I will do Ray of Frost on the boar.
2:09:18: Dungeon Master: Isn't Ray of Frost a single target?
2:09:27: Speaker_2: That's what I was thinking. Frigid Beam of Blue-White Light, ranged spell attack on the target.
2:09:38: Speaker_2: Oh, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet. So then with the vines, you'll have an additional 10 feet reduction.
2:09:44: Speaker_2: Um, okay. Yeah. And so you still technically standing on the vine.
2:09:47: Dungeon Master: And so you still technically standing on the vine.
2:09:57: Speaker_2: Got it. So that's a plus 8 to hit, so 18.
2:09:58: Dungeon Master: And that'll be 2d8.
2:09:59: Speaker_2: And that'll be 2d8.
2:09:59: Speaker_2: I got one here. Wait, these are d10s.
2:10:19: Speaker_3: He's gonna let it roll. Yeah, I was just gonna let it roll. He's like, weird, how am I doing so well?
2:10:19: Speaker_2: Yeah, I was just gonna let it roll.
2:10:24: Speaker_2: 6, 7 damage on the Ray of Frost.
2:10:29: Speaker_2: And his movement is reduced, and then... Is it 10 feet or by 10 feet?
2:10:32: Speaker_3: By 10 feet. Yeah, by 10 feet.
2:10:35: Speaker_2: Yeah, by 10 feet.
2:10:36: Speaker_3: Still good, 15 pizzas.
2:10:39: Speaker_2: And then with my bonus action, I will cast Magic Stone to bring up some stats. And that's my action.
2:10:56: Dungeon Master: Sorry, you're up. Alright. Am I going to have any trouble getting anywhere?  my action to, well before I do anything, I'm gonna say to Garfield, I'm gonna say, you know, help us kill these two fuckers.
2:11:10: Speaker_4: And now he's just gonna go, he's gonna make an attack on  me go here because you have to go around. He has pack tactics, but to give Kaladin an advantage I'll have him swing around here and I'll have him attack. That's my action. I'm going to transform into a bear. I  So I'm just going to have to try to stay close to his little glow so I can see. So I'll just move to right here, not knowing this is difficult terrain. That's what? 20? 20 feet? What's that? So I can get like another 5 feet.
2:11:58: Dungeon Master: I can't get any further. 5 feet, half. So yeah, you just like step onto it, give me some trick saving throw to enter it. Oh, shit.
2:12:23: Dungeon Master: Still slow, but you don't get stuck, but you're like right close to being you're not in range of it yet all right, and this is Okay, so um Garfield will attack
2:12:48: Speaker_4: He's going to get advantage because of pack tactics.
2:13:35: Dungeon Master: Oh nice, somebody's Vega. Is there a steel defender? I'm going to keep this for D6.
2:13:41: Speaker_2: So this guy was only an 11 to hit?
2:13:42: Dungeon Master: Yeah. That tells me that this is a good fight.
2:14:04: Speaker_4: He's the bad bad. These are just the peons.
2:14:04: Speaker_2: He's the bad bad. These are just the peons.
2:14:06: Speaker_4: No, no, this is it. We're at the final level.
2:14:09: Speaker_2: Maybe we should incapacitate him. Get some information.
2:14:14: Speaker_4: You want him to bite you? You can't turn into a were-thing. You're not a person. Up to top of the order?
2:14:19: Speaker_3: Up to top of the order?
2:14:19: Speaker_2: I don't know if it matters to me. Count him.
2:14:20: Speaker_3: I don't know if it matters to me. Count him.
2:14:23: Speaker_3: I'm gonna... Now that this boar is kind of surrounded, I'm gonna misty-step over to Terrence.
2:14:32: Speaker_3: I'm gonna yell at him.
2:14:34: Speaker_3: Who turned you?
2:14:36: Speaker_3: Tell me who.
2:14:37: Speaker_3: And I'm gonna go ahead and take another swinging attack out of advantage. Okay.
2:14:41: Speaker_3: Got 22 to hit.
2:15:00: Speaker_3: call it radiant damage on the additional oh that's awesome so it's yeah four and four so it's 711 points for the four of its radiant I never noticed that before the liquid inside yeah they're glitter liquid yeah I just I just noticed they're really fun
2:15:28: Dungeon Master: Good damage, a lot of damage. You don't know that the Radiant seems to do anything more so than the other stuff, but good damage on that still. Any of your turn? Bonus action, action? Yeah, bonus action, Misty Step action, swing. Okay. Next up will be the boar then. Having lost you in front of it, it'll turn to... This hasn't done anything to it yet, has it?
2:16:03: Speaker_2: for a little cat. It'll be four attacks then.
2:16:12: Dungeon Master: The first one will be a tusk at you, and then it'll be a ball on the... I'll tell you right now, they both hit.
2:16:19: Dungeon Master: Spiritual. Well, you don't know that. I've been rolling pretty garbage. Tusk.
2:16:26: Dungeon Master: Natural 20.
2:16:28: Dungeon Master: On me? Do you want to see it? Yeah. Jesus Christ. It's doing a little dance right now.  is 16 plus 5 21 okay they both i was rolling like 4 and 3 before it wasn't the cat has an ac of like 12 i think it's 11 plus my spell level which is 2 so 13 okay uh i need i need advice for this stuff 2d6 plus 3 on
2:16:53: Dungeon Master: be a roll if there's a contact. So I was like, don't get it. You take 8 plus 3, you take 11 points of slashing damage. Give me a DC, I'm not going to tell you what, constitution saving throw.
2:16:56: Speaker_2: be a roll if there's a contact.
2:17:13: Dungeon Master: Wait, so am I within five feet? Yeah
2:17:19: Speaker_3: Yeah
2:17:39: Dungeon Master: From the skill defender to the boars at five feet Okay, and then on the spiritual thing
2:18:11: Dungeon Master: So 8? Yeah, so I'll just try to remember 12. Did you say it's got 20 total? Yeah, it's got 20 total, so now it only has 12. I'll just count out 12. Okay, sounds good. After that is Terrence. It's, you're at him. Action to break out or disadvantage tactic by the shooter.
2:18:19: Speaker_4: Okay, sounds good.
2:18:34: Dungeon Master: So far he's been very successful. He's not strong, he's not going to try to break out.  He is going to, you see, he's going to try to slash your ankle and then bite you at the other ankle at the same time. Disadvantage on both short sword. 15 and 16 on the die, so he gets a plus four, that is 19 to hit.
2:18:59: Speaker_2: He uses a shield to make it miss.
2:18:59: Dungeon Master: He uses a shield to make it miss. No shield does. Okay, so short sword misses, which means that he still
2:19:02: Speaker_2: No shield does.
2:19:10: Dungeon Master: So don't worry about that second one. That game is turned. Leopold, you are up.
2:19:23: Speaker_2: I'm going to close the gap.
2:19:30: Speaker_2: I'm going to whip out my laser sword and roll to hit. You said that was a plus nine?
2:19:43: Speaker_2: 19. Oh, okay. Let's see if we get it. No. And then it was 1d8 plus a d4 plus 5. Okay, so that's 7 and then, yeah, so 12 damage.
2:20:13: Speaker_2: on the slice and then with my bonus action i will hurtle a stone i don't know if i can sidestep just without or maneuver a little bit so that way i can right through to terrence if you roll on that one you'll hit one of them but otherwise you can make it okay so go ahead and roll this and your
2:20:38: Dungeon Master: No, no, no, that's a second. That's the second. Okay. Yeah, but it does have disadvantage because it's prone. Yes All right, so disadvantage on the prone
2:20:45: Speaker_4: Yes All right, so disadvantage on the prone
2:20:49: Speaker_2: Uh, three plus nine. Looks like it's really bad.
2:20:53: Speaker_4: Uh, three plus nine.
2:20:58: Speaker_4: Looks like it's really bad.
2:21:00: Speaker_4: Well, as soon as you hit six levels, you're dead.
2:21:05: Speaker_2: You're just dead. You just died. Plus eight. So, uh, eleven?
2:21:12: Dungeon Master: Just misses. Just misses. Damn.
2:21:16: Speaker_2: Uh, so the stone flies wide. It hits the wall behind, sparks off there.
2:21:19: Dungeon Master: It hits the wall behind, sparks off there.
2:21:22: Speaker_2: That's my heart's turn, or, uh, vehicle. That's what I am.
2:21:24: Dungeon Master: That's what I am. The Steel Defender goes.
2:21:27: Speaker_2: The Steel Defender goes.
2:21:28: Speaker_2: Steel Defender rolls in. This is a walled corner, so you can't go into there.
2:21:29: Dungeon Master: This is a walled corner, so you can't go into there. Okay, yeah. Sorry, you can push me sideways. Yeah, I was gonna say, is there some space for the Steel Defender?
2:21:32: Speaker_2: Okay, yeah.
2:21:34: Speaker_2: Yeah, I was gonna say, is there some space for the Steel Defender? You guys are on all four sides. No. There's no space for the Defender? Not for this.
2:21:41: Dungeon Master: Not for this. The Defender could enter the room, but... Uh, okay, so the Defender, could the Defender pass by to attack?
2:21:43: Speaker_2: Yes. Okay.
2:21:47: Dungeon Master: Yes.
2:21:48: Dungeon Master: As it enters that space,
2:22:06: Speaker_2: See this is it doesn't pull up for whatever reason but it does show here I just have to find it because it's buried.
2:22:18: Speaker_2: Yeah steel defender. Oh
2:22:25: Speaker_2: 14. Okay. So that's plus two.
2:22:29: Speaker_2: 21.
2:22:33: Speaker_2: Okay, so he'll do a force-empowered rend, which is 1d8 plus proficiency bonus.
2:22:54: Speaker_2: It has advantage because the player is prone. Right, I was just trying to find the modifier to hit.
2:23:09: Speaker_4: Okay, so plus 9 then.
2:23:09: Speaker_2: And it's with advantage.
2:23:15: Speaker_2: So that'll hit. 14 plus 9.
2:23:27: Speaker_2: five and then it's plus my proficiency bonus so three so eight damage on the yep terence is looking hurt take that terence that's my turn okay back up three
2:23:49: Speaker_4: That's going to be plus seven, so I'm going to make two attacks, Bite and Claw on this guy with advantage.
2:24:02: Speaker_4: Slashing for the claws. Two, four, so six plus five, 11 on the claw.
2:24:30: Speaker_4: I'm gonna have Garfield make an attack with advantage. It's gonna be a plus seven to hit. He only gets one attack, but it's advantage. That's gonna be 18 to hit. Okay, that's one to eight plus four plus two.
2:24:47: Speaker_4: that's gonna be six um 12 uh piercing damage damn cat puts out some damage that's my uh does your spiritual whatever
2:25:40: Dungeon Master: You're a bear.
2:25:42: Dungeon Master: I know, I thought I got, I thought I had something in my last thing that said that my attack was magical as my form, but let me double check first.
2:25:44: Speaker_4: But yeah, that's my whole turn.
2:25:51: Dungeon Master: But yeah, that's my whole turn.
2:25:52: Dungeon Master: Okay.
2:25:54: Dungeon Master: Uh, at the very top of the order, Kaladin, you're up. Yeah, it says my beast power counts as magical attacks for overcoming resistance.
2:26:00: Speaker_4: I'll be at level 6. It's called, uh, Primal Strike.
2:26:04: Dungeon Master: Perfect. Alright.
2:26:10: Dungeon Master: Where are they?
2:26:18: Dungeon Master: where I formed his teeth sticking out, his nose was up and down, he goes, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
2:26:25: Dungeon Master: It was a wild night, I don't totally remember.
2:26:29: Dungeon Master: Everybody was giving out these syringes, it was crazy.
2:26:33: Dungeon Master: That's all I remember, and then the full moon happened, and I had a great night, and now I just come back here.
2:26:43: Speaker_3: Don't hurt me.
2:26:49: Speaker_3: And it'll take another attack with advantage.
2:26:50: Speaker_2: Wait!
2:26:53: Speaker_2: Got some silver dust on that blade. That's a 16. I haven't put it on yet.
2:26:57: Dungeon Master: It'd be a bonus action to apply. 21 to hit.
2:27:02: Dungeon Master: But you guys never ground it down, did you? The silver? No. Okay.
2:27:34: Speaker_3: 6 plus 3, 9 total. Without completely eviscerating to the point where he couldn't heal because he's going to, how do you want to finish him for now?
2:27:50: Speaker_3: I think light splitter would just plunge like deep into his chest. It's just like super high blade. Just gets sort of encumbered by vines at that point.
2:27:56: Dungeon Master: Just gets sort of encumbered by vines at that point. Blade hits and it goes through into the pack dirt. You just feel a little bit of give as you like sever his spine. Pull it out. Body doesn't respond. Completely limp. End of your turn.
2:28:12: Speaker_3: Do I sense anyone else? We haven't said anything. Does this just end? Is there anything over there?
2:28:21: Dungeon Master: You look up and you don't see any other forms at this point. Board turn, it's going to take an attack on... Give me... Well, d20 is in your rolls. Lowest is getting the tusks.
2:28:45: Dungeon Master: Getting them all!
2:29:04: Speaker_2: oh 23 to hit they also did get hit by frost damage so that would prevent healing right yes uh well that's not that's chilling touch oh that's its own deal oh yeah that's special it's not just frost damage 20 20 does not hit god damn gotta hit me with a 21 i'm over here with a 12
2:29:04: Dungeon Master: oh 23 to hit they also did get hit by frost damage so that would prevent healing right yes uh well that's not that's chilling touch oh that's its own deal oh yeah that's special it's not just frost damage 20 20 does not hit god damn gotta hit me with a 21 i'm over here with a 12
2:29:29: Dungeon Master: Yeah It's a werewolf thing translate into your bear form You know wait am I within now within five feet with this still
2:30:13: Dungeon Master: He attacked you and then he attacked Leopold. But missed Leopold.
2:30:20: Dungeon Master: Okay.
2:30:21: Dungeon Master: On his turn, you see that Terrence just sort of like, the body kind of like moves underneath the vines and you hear like a  As the spine corrects, and the cut over its chest closes, he doesn't come back to consciousness right away. Healed, because he wasn't killed with the silver weapon. Unconscious, but killing him, he likes it. He does. Yes, again!
2:30:48: Speaker_2: My turn.
2:30:51: Speaker_2: I will make another strike against the boar.
2:30:58: Speaker_2: That would be with advantage, right? So there's flanking.
2:31:08: Speaker_2: That would be 18 to hit. You can hit. Cool. And then that would be a 1d8 plus 4. That's 10. Give me an 8.
2:31:33: Speaker_2: four damage, but then plus five, so nine damage.
2:31:38: Speaker_2: Nine damage with the sword.
2:31:42: Speaker_2: And then with a bonus action, I will do a magic stone on the board.
2:31:49: Speaker_2: And that would be with disadvantage because I'm so close, right?
2:31:58: Speaker_2: Or I guess it would be a flat roll because I have advantage from flanking.
2:32:02: Speaker_2: yeah okay 14 plus 8 hits and that's a it's because I put it I put it in for the skill defender
2:32:31: Speaker_2: four, and plus five, another nine damage with that stone.
2:32:36: Speaker_2: So, 18 damage total. And then, with that is Leopold's turn, with my skill defender, he will retrace some steps, and whoosh. And that would be with advantage, correct.
2:32:51: Dungeon Master: And that would be with advantage, correct.
2:32:57: Speaker_2: 19 plus nine would hit, and that's,
2:33:02: Speaker_2: 1d8 plus 3, yeah.
2:33:10: Speaker_2: 4 damage.
2:33:16: Speaker_2: And that's my turn.
2:33:18: Dungeon Master: Zario's up next. Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and attack twice as a bear.
2:33:25: Speaker_4: Come on, Zario! That's gonna be a plus 7 to hit.
2:33:42: Speaker_4: bite that's uh 10 piercing damage on the bite and then 2d6 plus 5 on the claw it's going to be 2 plus 6 plus 5 11 on the bite and then garfield is going to take another attack just how would you like to finish up for now let's see um it's a boar so as a bear i'm just going to take a big chunk out of it just like bite it grab the back strap
2:34:18: Dungeon Master: Pick it up by, like, that thick of its neck. Tearing it around, back and forth, back and forth, and eventually you hear its neck snap as you throw it up against the wall. Drops, unmoving.
2:34:33: Speaker_4: How far is it from here? I don't have difficult terrain because it's floating, right? Yeah. Okay, so I'll just have to... Oh, he's already dead.
2:34:42: Speaker_2: Unconscious.
2:34:52: Speaker_4: I should probably drop my bear form.
2:34:55: Speaker_4: I'll wait.
2:34:57: Dungeon Master: I'll just chill. That'd be my turn.
2:35:00: Dungeon Master: As the fight sort of drops and you guys are out of combat for this moment, the Forearms, again, not dead, slowly healing, putting themselves back together. You can sort of pick up on the music above you again. It's like you just sort of noticed the singing again.
2:35:20: Dungeon Master: You feel that.  Do you guys have this dark cavern in front of you? Does he still have a hole in his chest where I stabbed him? It's healed up. It's healed up. Yes. Can we restrain these guys?
2:36:06: Speaker_3: But as soon as he wakes up, he gets to roll. We gotta kill these guys. We don't have any way. Can I stab him again?  through the chest. I'm going to pull the silver necklace out that I have. I'm going to wrap it around the eight-orc arch, and I'm just going to start sawing the arch. Saw his head off? No, just the eight-orc arch. Saw the heart out.
2:36:25: Dungeon Master: Saw the heart out.
2:36:27: Dungeon Master: Saw the heart out. Makeshift weapon would do one point of damage anyway. You kill him with a silver weapon. Eventually, blood starts spurting all over your face and your chest and your arms and your hands. It's like a bloodbath of a scene. You guys see Kaladin do  And he gets up and he's soaked on his face and his chest. And he's just covered in blood.
2:37:28: Speaker_2: So if you treated it really quick We only have this silver necklace.
2:37:28: Speaker_3: So if you treated it really quick We only have this silver necklace.
2:37:33: Speaker_3: We just have a couple of them.
2:37:35: Speaker_2: Okay Oh, I'm gonna take a silver piece coin and I'm gonna load it into my chest and I'm gonna
2:37:43: Dungeon Master: and stuff, you can make dust.
2:37:49: Speaker_2: And this coin is just going to fly out of my chest cavern into the... Right through its chest.
2:37:55: Dungeon Master: Body just like, lurches and drops. And you see, when you finish it with it, and same with Terrence, when you finish Song through his Aorta Guardian, the bodies revert back into the human forms. This other person just looks like a regular guy, dark black messy hair, average height, pretty thin build, nobody you've ever seen before.
2:38:19: Speaker_3: Can we take a second are there any other signs of maybe
2:38:23: Speaker_3: in an organization? Are they planning something? Or is this just their little den? It's just like a little room. Pretty easy little thing.
2:38:28: Dungeon Master: Pretty easy little thing. You see in here, this just looks like a living space. There's like straw heaps put together on the ground, like they put together a comfortable place. You notice there's a lot more places to lay than there are things in this room, but these are the only two in here that you, you're taking a moment. You're just kind of hanging out. Nothing kind of comes in at this point.  so nothing interesting over in that corner we head down the other tunnel yeah do we get the impression that that's been traveling recently
2:39:05: Dungeon Master: As you sort of turn and go down that way, there is like a tunnel above your head that Garfield starts doing little spins and back flips around, pointing to. That's where one came in. That's where he came in. Not this tunnel here, but one right above it.
2:39:22: Dungeon Master: Yeah, like it connects through the top. And you see, looking around, there are side tunnels all over the place, little holes and reliefs in the walls, things like that.
2:39:22: Speaker_4: Yeah, like it connects through the top.
2:39:37: Speaker_3: But the other one's large enough for us to travel down?
2:39:41: Speaker_3: Yes.
2:39:42: Speaker_3: So the relief tunnels could easily backfill with some creatures or something, presumably.
2:39:42: Speaker_2: So the relief tunnels could easily backfill with some creatures or something, presumably.
2:39:48: Speaker_2: Let's keep moving.
2:39:50: Speaker_4: So yeah, do we want to just head down that tunnel?
2:39:55: Speaker_4: Does anybody want anything?
2:40:03: Speaker_3: I'm good. I mean, I've used some spells and stuff, but. I've used a couple of ones with chromatic orb and two shield reactions.
2:40:10: Speaker_2: I haven't used any spells yet, so... That was three rounds.
2:40:20: Dungeon Master: So that wasn't even a full minute, but the travel time and everything. So yeah, about 30 minutes left on Garfield.
2:40:30: Speaker_3: Yeah, let's trigger all this with our time.
2:40:32: Speaker_4: Yeah, let's head on down this way. Do we want to be quiet or not? Of course. I'll hang back here.
2:40:40: Speaker_4: Stay back. All right, so yeah, we'll head down.
2:40:45: Dungeon Master: Doesn't matter how loud, Damien. We'll head down this way. So stealth, roughly six seconds later.
2:40:54: Dungeon Master: with the one that i rolled on that you hear a just farther down in a direction that you can't see in a tunnel not like not directly above you coming in not above
2:41:03: Dungeon Master: Just rather quickly, they were able to sort of track down the sort of location of it. Stealth? Do you want to stealth check so we're just here, we make note of that, we hear it?
2:41:20: Speaker_3: You hear that? Up to you guys what you want to do. You want to stealth, you want to run, up to you.
2:41:28: Dungeon Master: Nothing else has happened. Should we just run? We can run through the tunnel.
2:41:33: Speaker_3: Yeah, let's just run.
2:41:37: Speaker_2: You guys have already left.
2:41:38: Speaker_3: Leopold, let's go. I thought I was going to be sitting there, like, hanging out.
2:41:43: Dungeon Master: You guys... I'm going to just makeshift something real quick for fun. This tunnel is long, hundreds of feet, barely wide enough to go more than one person. You could, like, run, squeeze by sideways, but as far as single file for most of it, you guys hear a lot of noise behind you. You're making it 50 feet or so, and then you hear  Rushing wave of things back as you guys are making your way through this tunnel. We're gonna go into sort of a bullet time run event As you guys can do stuff You hear a lot of noises you are sprinting ahead. Everybody go ahead and roll initiative
2:42:52: Dungeon Master: Fifteen.
2:42:54: Dungeon Master: Six.
2:42:54: Dungeon Master: Five.
2:42:56: Speaker_4: Is this what we're thinking the order is? You up front. Second.
2:43:01: Speaker_2: Yeah, I was sitting in the cave until you guys yell at me, so I'm definitely far behind.
2:43:12: Dungeon Master: You guys I mean it you guys are pretty seasoned fight at this point the amount of noise you hear behind you is concerning you're like oh shit We're gonna get this there's no way we make it out of that fight alive So you're start running you get into a full sprint down this hallway First up will be Zario We're gonna say the full distance is 300  tunnel space you don't know what's on the other side of it but you know that you have to get out of this space we're gonna say something happens on initiative count 20 at the new round and at the bottom of the round each time so you can use your full movement and dash you can use your movement and action to do something they were gonna say no bonus actions at this point just for like this little mini thing we're doing here but it's already the first movement  All right, just to see how it goes, I'm just gonna run.
2:44:08: Speaker_4: Do I have to roll anything? Nope, just movement and dash. Yeah, I'll do action and movement to... So you're still a bear.
2:44:16: Dungeon Master: I was thinking about that. I'm faster as a bear, but I don't think I can fit. You could fit as a bear, but nobody can pass you no matter what. You take up the full space. Yeah, I'll drop it. Okay.  running on two feet as a bear anyway with your bowler hat. Transition into your human form. So that's 60 feet total? Okay.
2:44:24: Speaker_4: Yeah, I'll drop it.
2:44:26: Speaker_4: Okay.
2:44:42: Speaker_3: You're pretty fast walking on two feet as a bear.
2:44:42: Dungeon Master: You're pretty fast walking on two feet as a bear.
2:44:44: Speaker_3: Yeah, I'm going to do the same thing. I won't spend an action.
2:44:50: Speaker_3: I'll use it to dash.
2:44:55: Speaker_3: 60 feet. 60 feet.
2:44:58: Dungeon Master: Leopold, you are up.
2:45:00: Speaker_2: So we're being pursued from behind, correct? Yes. The tunnel is six feet.
2:45:01: Dungeon Master: Yes.
2:45:05: Dungeon Master: If you are having trouble standing full height, I'm not going to reduce your movement by any amount, but you don't have room to play around.
2:45:13: Speaker_2: I'm just going to use the grease spell to create difficult terrain.
2:45:16: Speaker_2: Can I make that the whole surface of the tunnel? Yeah. As you're sprinting, you just like...
2:45:21: Dungeon Master: Yeah. As you're sprinting, you just like...  You're like, sort of crank your running, you go floor all the way around your body as you sprint and you create a full arch of this sort of grease ball behind you.
2:45:32: Speaker_2: Excellent. So I'll do that with my action.
2:45:36: Speaker_2: Um, and then I'll use the remainder of my movement, which is 30 feet. So I'll be behind you guys, but because I use an action instead of dashing.
2:45:43: Dungeon Master: Okay.
2:45:49: Dungeon Master: and fill in the space. You see dozens of like animalistic forms butting into each other, shouldering, running, and it's good that you do what you do because you see some of them are like on the ceiling running towards you and then you see they're going much faster than you guys are currently and they sort of you're like 30 feet ahead at this point and then the grease hits them from behind and you see some of them trip and they sort of make a temporary block  moving forward but you see more animals come out of the tunnels behind them sort of ahead of the block moving forward  Okay, but they they seem much faster than you guys at this point up at the top Sorry, yeah, I'll use my Action for movement again, but then I'll tell Garfield to float to the back at the front of whoever's there and I want him to try to trip a big one
2:46:36: Speaker_4: Okay, but they they seem much faster than you guys at this point up at the top Sorry, yeah, I'll use my Action for movement again, but then I'll tell Garfield to float to the back at the front of whoever's there and I want him to try to trip a big one
2:46:59: Speaker_4: Okay, so he'll hang back. Yeah, I want him to just like fall back and then, I don't know if it's an attack or what, but to try to block somehow.
2:47:05: Speaker_4: Okay. So if you float behind Leo and just move it to go opposite.
2:47:11: Dungeon Master: You guys are all technically moving forward at the same time, so the Garfield will just stay and everybody sort of passes. Leopold, as you're running forward, you see this little tabby cat that's just waiting patiently to sacrifice itself.
2:47:11: Speaker_4: You guys are all technically moving forward at the same time, so the Garfield will just stay and everybody sort of passes.
2:47:25: Dungeon Master: Yeah. So 30 feet or 60?
2:47:30: Speaker_4: I don't think there's anything I have that would be helpful.
2:47:32: Speaker_4: I'm too far away to do anything there.
2:47:37: Speaker_4: Yeah, I don't have anything good.
2:47:41: Speaker_4: So yeah, I'll move.
2:47:44: Speaker_4: And then, yeah, I'll have five.
2:47:45: Dungeon Master: You were at 120.
2:47:48: Dungeon Master: Callan, you were up.
2:47:49: Speaker_3: I'm gonna use the cantrip firebolt to light the grease on fire.
2:47:55: Speaker_3: Nice.
2:48:02: Speaker_3: I'll move 30 more feet down the tunnel.
2:48:06: Speaker_3: Make it to 90.
2:48:07: Dungeon Master: You turn your head and you shoot it and it lights it and you see you light the fur of like enormous werewolves. The bright eyes ignite and you see them  Massive animals way more than you knew were in this tunnel system Fighting and clawing and like reaching like pushing each other back moving through this tunnel 30 Leo you are up
2:48:42: Speaker_2: So I have Expeditious Retreat, but you said we're not doing bonus actions, so that doesn't really give me anything, right?
2:48:48: Dungeon Master: You could cast it as your action if you'd like.
2:48:50: Speaker_2: But it just gives me the dash action?
2:48:52: Dungeon Master: Yeah. Let's you move quickly, you're already behind. The great thing about Expeditious Retreat is when you cast it, you can use it that round. So I can say you can cast it and then get the dash as the action as part of that.
2:49:05: Speaker_2: But then I wouldn't be able to dash additionally, right?
2:49:08: Dungeon Master: It would take the place of the dash. Doesn't it also increase your movement at all? It just says you take the dash action.
2:49:11: Speaker_2: It just says you take the dash action. That's okay. So you still have 30 feet of movement, right?
2:49:13: Dungeon Master: That's okay. So you still have 30 feet of movement, right? And then you still get the bonus 30.
2:49:17: Speaker_2: But it doesn't because then the only other thing it lets me do is the dash action as a bonus action.
2:49:24: Speaker_3: Correct. So for the next coming rounds while you hold that concentration.  Okay, that's what I was asking because if we're not doing bonus actions Okay, yeah, so I will I'll do a expeditious retreat to catch up and I'll close that distance I'll Close 60 feet instead of 30 Okay
2:49:54: Speaker_2: I guess the Steel Defender is... Yeah, he's been moving, but he has movement speed of 40 feet, so... Okay, I'll do that.
2:49:58: Dungeon Master: Yeah.
2:50:15: Dungeon Master: They're in the garage too, if you want some of those ones.
2:50:21: Speaker_2: It's just the season.
2:50:22: Dungeon Master: It's just the season.
2:50:24: Dungeon Master: Instead of getting their 90, they'll go 45. With the addition of Garfield, they're only going to go 30. So they are at 60.
2:51:00: Speaker_2: Yeah Yeah, I think I think Megan's mom or parents got it for It's a little brush you see I
2:51:18: Dungeon Master: You see this little tabby, he's standing, essentially, in the air with his arms out. There is this mass of werewolves. And he pushes one, and he sticks his leg out, and he's sort of defending. But all of a sudden, you see multiple claws tear him into pieces as he makes his one final stand. It's like the mass almost fills to the top of the tumble space of they can't crawl past each other. Before one finally pushes forward, you see a werewolf topples Ass Over Tea Kettle out.  So back at the top of Zarya. I think I'm just going to keep running. I don't think I have anything else that I can do. Movement dash?
2:52:16: Dungeon Master: Yeah. Too far. You make it to 180. You are 120 feet from the open cavern space. You can't see past it. It's like it drops out. You don't know if it's like a steep one or anything, but there's like a bigger space it opens out to. Kaladin.
2:52:31: Dungeon Master: I'm going to use movement N.  You go 60, that puts you at 150.
2:52:42: Dungeon Master: Leopold.
2:52:43: Speaker_2: So I'll do an action to dash, and then with my expeditious retreat, use a bonus action to dash. So 30, 60, 90. 90, yeah. So you just kind of see me.
2:52:49: Dungeon Master: 90, yeah.
2:52:54: Speaker_2: You're already caught up to me. Leopold, you jump over and morph your body, and then tumble in front of Kaladin as you pass him, and you catch up to Zariel at the front.
2:52:57: Dungeon Master: Leopold, you jump over and morph your body, and then tumble in front of Kaladin as you pass him, and you catch up to Zariel at the front.
2:53:06: Dungeon Master: Let's get out of here. Kaladin now in the back, just barely by 30 feet.  At the very bottom, the werewolves move, they have 90 feet, so they get to 150. So, they catch right up to Kaladin. You see, as you were sprinting, sort of fast moving as you can, you see like this massive creature's going up and you're sort of like dodging hands and claws and you're jumping and then one will make an attack at you at disadvantage as it's right behind you.
2:53:36: Dungeon Master: natural two misses, don't get clawed or anything, keep moving, that's all they can do. Top of the rounds are real.
2:53:45: Speaker_4: How far back was that?
2:53:46: Speaker_4: They are 30 feet from the leaders.
2:53:47: Dungeon Master: They are 30 feet from the leaders.
2:53:49: Speaker_3: They're 30 feet from us? Yeah. Jesus Christ. They have 90. Okay. All right. Let's see.
2:54:11: Dungeon Master: This is my original Maharp Village music. Nice. But since I was the only one listening to it, nobody else could hear it. Oh, that's great. You had your own soundtrack?
2:54:26: Dungeon Master: Yeah. Oh, damn.
2:54:28: Dungeon Master: That's hilarious.
2:54:31: Speaker_3: Yeah, have you ever been in the brewery where they have all the Jubilee posters?
2:54:36: Speaker_3: Yeah, it's cool. It goes all the way back to like, yeah, I feel like it almost goes back to the 80s. Well, I mean, I think they, I feel like they  I'll have it be... I don't know.
2:54:48: Dungeon Master: I'll have it be... I don't know.
2:54:52: Dungeon Master: I'm not going to make you make a check. You saw from what happened with Garfield. There are enough monsters behind you guys that it would not make it a full round before it got eviscerated. So at most you're going to buy yourself having their action for one round. So if you want to waste a special on that,
2:55:16: Dungeon Master: I just don't have anything else I can do to slow it down at all. How far away are we?
2:55:25: Dungeon Master: And they have
2:55:36: Speaker_2: But we're even Yeah, assuming I dash and dash well you've got 60 feet
2:55:52: Speaker_3: I have up to 90 feet casting range.
2:56:04: Speaker_4: There should be a right between Kaladin and them. And I'm just going to try to slow down as much as I can.
2:56:19: Speaker_2: What are you casting? Sun and Beast.
2:56:21: Speaker_4: Just something as big as it possibly can.
2:56:21: Speaker_2: Just something as big as it possibly can.
2:56:33: Speaker_3: With them essentially snapping at me and, like, right next to me, can I just reaction, throw my hands up, and cast?
2:56:43: Speaker_3: The cantrip that we talked about? Yeah. It's a bonus action, I'll cast it as an action. It does force damage, so I'm just trying to maybe either collapse part of the tunnel or create difficult terrain.
2:56:56: Speaker_3: Not necessarily target a ware creature. I like it.
2:57:00: Dungeon Master: You're like getting snipped at and shoulders are like pushing your whole body. Listen, you get one shove, it almost turns you 180 degrees and you throw your hands up and shoot at the ground.  pushing yourself back, it'll just go off. I'm gonna say there's, what is the damage die? 2D10. 2D10. There is a damage threshold of 15. You break 15, the ground collapses. Otherwise, you break different frames, you'll slow them down. Okay.
2:57:32: Dungeon Master: Eight. Eight. Below is the ground, the ground sinks a little bit. You see like one of the missteps, they sort of pile up again.  They'll have half movement for this round. You push yourself a little bit and then you continue to move at 30 more feet.
2:57:50: Dungeon Master: That puts you to 180 at that point.
2:57:57: Speaker_2: So he's made the tunnel a little unsturdy. Yes.
2:58:02: Speaker_2: So I have a spell Earth Trimmer, which generally, I think, is meant to just either cause difficult terrain or, you know, if a creature fails a deck save, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning.
2:58:13: Speaker_2: But could I somehow focus it into the earth where he's made it unstable to try and collapse the tunnel fully? You could try to do it at the top to further create difficult terrain.
2:58:19: Dungeon Master: You could try to do it at the top to further create difficult terrain. Yeah, essentially just like have it again.
2:58:22: Speaker_2: Yeah, essentially just like have it again. Yeah, but that'll give you only, you'll only have a dash, so it'll be 60 feet as opposed to 90.
2:58:36: Speaker_2: I'll burn a spell, I'll cast Earth Trimmer, and I would get him down to what, 30 feet?
2:58:47: Speaker_2: Oh, 22. 22, okay. So you're making distance on him.
2:58:53: Speaker_2: But that only lasts for one turn.
2:58:55: Speaker_2: Is there running through it? That's okay.
2:58:56: Dungeon Master: 210, 240, 180.
2:59:03: Dungeon Master: I guess also we haven't discussed how your creature is going to slow down.
2:59:06: Speaker_2: I guess also we haven't discussed how your creature is going to slow down.
2:59:11: Speaker_2: It did. Oh, that's like the half movement.
2:59:12: Dungeon Master: It did. Oh, that's like the half movement. I see. Okay. So that was going to slow him down.
2:59:15: Speaker_2: I see. Okay. So that was going to slow him down.
2:59:20: Dungeon Master: Okay. Um, after that it goes to the werewolf's turn. Um, you see,  into the ground, and then they hit that, and they tumble over into Calladin's disturbed dirt that their hands go into, and one of them snaps its shoulder, and it's like the other one will step on its head and breaks it temporarily. One of them is down, and then the ceiling collapses, and you just see temporarily, it's just a mound of dirt, as you guys are sprinting and gaining distance before the dirt explodes with other ones. I mean, just destroying the ones on the ground, but they're now much farther behind.  So they will only go 20 feet, that puts them at 170. Max. Then, back up your time to Zara.
3:00:12: Dungeon Master: You're almost out. I'll just action dash.
3:00:18: Dungeon Master: Takes you to 270. You'll be out next turn, with just movement.
3:00:29: Speaker_3: That takes you to...
3:00:42: Speaker_2: I'm gonna action dash and then expeditious retreat for another dash 60 feet of your 90 feet movement you get the edge of the tunnel you pass
3:00:46: Dungeon Master: give me a dexterity saving throw.
3:00:59: Speaker_2: That would be with disadvantage, correct? Because I'm... No, it's a saving throw.
3:01:00: Dungeon Master: That would be with disadvantage, correct?
3:01:06: Speaker_2: Okay. All right. So then it's just flat. 20, not 20. Oh, damn.
3:01:09: Dungeon Master: Oh, damn.
3:01:09: Speaker_2: 22.
3:01:09: Dungeon Master: Love that. You... And I've got a map for it, but we're going to take a quick break, smoke a little bit for the big fight.
3:01:12: Dungeon Master: You...  hit this space and it is opening into this huge cavern but you've got so much momentum that you hit the ground you have like the foresight to be like there's a drop that you kick the wall as you go and you push yourself forward and you launch through this space and you land on top of this like dirt stone bridge that oversees like the area below it it's this huge cavern or space there are like elevated areas a platform that connects it in this huge bottom area underneath and you clear the
3:01:52: Dungeon Master: running into this open space too.
3:01:56: Speaker_2: So it's a land bridge that connects.
3:01:58: Dungeon Master: Yeah. What kind of gap did he clear?
3:01:59: Speaker_3: Huge. There's some downfall to this too.
3:02:05: Speaker_2: So I essentially jumped out of the tunnel and landed on an island that's elevated. Is that what I'm picturing?
3:02:22: Dungeon Master: From there, you jumped, cleared this whole space, and landed on top of me. And landed perfectly in the middle. Yes. Jesus. That's the one that gets you a lot. You cleared this whole space, so they're going to be clearing out of here in a moment. This, 60 feet up in the air, so you drop 60 feet down. You're still defender, just don't.
3:02:26: Speaker_2: And landed perfectly in the middle.
3:02:41: Speaker_2: Yeah, I put him in my back, so.
3:02:45: Dungeon Master: That'll be your turn. With it also in that 20, I'm going to let you warn them that that's coming up. As you, like, odeer through the air, they know something is coming up.
3:02:55: Dungeon Master: Sorry.
3:02:57: Dungeon Master: Sorry. They go... Like, oh, okay, I better pay attention here.
3:03:01: Dungeon Master: Nobody have their movement this round, so they go the full 90, so that takes them to... Right back to my ass. Right up to Calvin. Right up to my ass again.
3:03:08: Speaker_3: Right up to my ass again.
3:03:10: Speaker_2: That's a lot for all the stuff we've done so far. It's okay, at least we haven't been absolutely overwhelmed with sixes.
3:03:10: Dungeon Master: That's a lot for all the stuff we've done so far.
3:03:13: Speaker_3: It's okay, at least we haven't been absolutely overwhelmed with sixes. Yeah, that's great. I love that. Okay, back at the top.
3:03:27: Speaker_3: Just a sheer light yeah drops down Like the tunnel lets out and we'll say like technically right here because I don't want to feel like oh I just jumped there you guys don't have like
3:03:42: Dungeon Master: You with the action could do something to get yourself to this You could get to like a platform or something or to here, but Leopold fucking clear this yeah I just love to race I was moving fast. I try to make it jump. Yeah, so you can do a dexterity saving throw with advantage
3:04:01: Speaker_2: I try to make it jump. Yeah, so you can do a dexterity saving throw with advantage
3:04:20: Dungeon Master: And that's what I mean.
3:04:22: Dungeon Master: Excellent. So Ariel jumps out, and then as he's partway through the air, just like fine whips to there. And then he catches his shoulder, and you see just all the way, hits that, slides onto his feet. No issue there. Since you were out of the chase sequence, you also have your bonus action, if you can do anything with the bonus. Nothing good.
3:04:48: Dungeon Master: then your turn. Yours is full movement and dash. So does that give me to the edge? It gives you, you are 240, 60 feet gives you to the 300 mark. Yeah, same thing. But you won't have something fun, just dexterity things or with advantage to do something.
3:05:05: Dungeon Master: That's a 17 plus four.
3:05:06: Speaker_3: Let's do it.
3:05:09: Speaker_2: 21. 21. Left or right? If I make a big gap, we'll
3:05:10: Speaker_3: 21. 21. Left or right? If I make a big gap, we'll  I'll go right.
3:05:20: Dungeon Master: We'll split the difference on everything.
3:05:22: Dungeon Master: You sort of see that Zorio goes left and you sort of like angle it on the tunnel where you're kind of wall running a little bit and then you leap out to the right, catch just the edge of  sweet onto your feet and then we'll get to what you oh you see as you guys like clear that just a massive like like in terms pour out of the tunnel space just ass over tea kettle falling into the space below some of them hit the ground like you hear like the yelps is like they die from like they've been pummeled and stepped on sometimes some of them like run to try to catch up and like scratch the climb the walls and you hear this
3:05:22: Speaker_3: You sort of see that Zorio goes left and you sort of like angle it on the tunnel where you're kind of wall running a little bit and then you leap out to the right, catch just the edge of
3:05:44: Dungeon Master: the large deep sort of growling howl and all of them sort of stop and they back up and they sort of hit on the perimeter just
3:06:24: Dungeon Master: piercing yellow eyes as a creature comes into view, but we'll take a quick break.
3:06:32: Dungeon Master: I don't have a menu.
3:06:32: Dungeon Master: No! Because he unbroke his bucket. Let me put a beanie baby out there.
3:06:37: Speaker_2: Put a beanie baby.
3:06:50: Dungeon Master: Let's start with this. Is this space?
3:06:56: Dungeon Master: Is this also a pit? This is 60 feet down. So this is traversable. And we're elevated. This is like tunnels in between. OK. We'll say this is like maybe 10, 15 feet wide, so 45 feet of movement space. OK. These are all anything colored is 60 feet elevated. So is he standing on like the edge of a- He's technically on another piece of like this that's just like where he was laying. Right.
3:07:01: Speaker_2: And we're elevated. This is like tunnels in between.
3:07:14: Speaker_4: So is he standing on like the edge of a- He's technically on another piece of like this that's just like where he was laying.
3:07:23: Speaker_3: How large is this creature? Huge, huge, huge. We're mediums. Large, huge, gigantic.
3:07:29: Speaker_3: Okay. See, he could clear these tunnels. What is the largest creature called?
3:07:32: Speaker_2: See, he could clear these tunnels. What is the largest creature called?
3:07:37: Speaker_2: Colossal. Garajuan Dead Colossal.
3:07:41: Speaker_2: Okay, so on the scale of how big he could be.
3:07:44: Speaker_3: It's triple our size. Right.
3:07:47: Speaker_2: Right.  He could make it through these tunnels.
3:07:50: Speaker_3: He couldn't probably make it to the one we were running. Yeah, but underneath this little land bridge.
3:07:52: Speaker_2: Yeah, but underneath this little land bridge.
3:07:54: Speaker_3: This is six feet.
3:07:58: Speaker_3: He is a 20-foot creature. Huge.
3:08:02: Speaker_3: Right, 20, isn't that when huge starts? Yeah, something like that. Maybe 25. OK. You guys, in this space,
3:08:12: Dungeon Master: you see this enormous werewolf, fully, you see it's got long limbs and fairly muscular legs, and it's not just on four feet, it seems to be almost bipedal, using the other ones to sort of guide its movements. Somewhere between, well, it's not fully standing like a bear. It doesn't have a hat. Somewhere like it pushes itself onto two feet, but can definitely walk if it wanted to. It usually probably crawls. In Dead Space, piercing yellow-red eyes,  And it very much is familiar to you guys. You saw creatures that very much look just like this on the attack on that festival. It lets out its enormous howl as you guys can just go ahead and roll initiative again, you know? Get right into it. I have a quick question.
3:09:08: Speaker_4: Yes. I rolled a dirty 20 on initiative. Okay.
3:09:15: Speaker_4: The shield, does it have, is it a regular shield or is it like a plus one shield?
3:09:16: Speaker_4: 14. Regular shield, it just does additional things against a creature. Do what I can.
3:09:20: Speaker_2: Regular shield, it just does additional things against a creature.
3:09:27: Speaker_2: Do what I can. It's better, I think that's the best roll I've had all night for advantage roll. Yeah.
3:09:35: Speaker_2: All right.
3:09:36: Dungeon Master: What happens to the creature that I fought before? Is it a disadvantage to hit me, or is it an advantage, or how does that work? You would have to set it up, so you could try to set it up real quick. You attempt to recount past battles, both real or imagined, to the shield upon a successful DC 10 charisma persuasion, or 15 charisma deception check. You gain a plus one bonus to the creatures describable within the shield.  So plus one you had a real fight. It shouldn't be too hard.
3:10:17: Speaker_3: I was gonna say yeah, so you can wear creatures already get this added in Not ones that big doesn't matter, okay?
3:10:17: Speaker_4: I was gonna say yeah, so you can wear creatures already get this added in Not ones that big doesn't matter, okay?
3:10:24: Speaker_3: It's a plus two shield yeah against that creature if if it's successful When I got here
3:10:25: Speaker_4: It's a plus two shield yeah against that creature if if it's successful When I got here
3:10:39: Speaker_2: I need to come back.
3:10:40: Speaker_4: I need to come back.
3:10:42: Speaker_4: I just want to play games. I play with buddies.
3:10:42: Speaker_3: I just want to play games.
3:10:43: Speaker_2: I play with buddies.
3:11:09: Speaker_3: My charisma is a minus one. I like how you had a very personal conversation with the shield. Alright. No, I have a five.
3:11:18: Dungeon Master: It's like... Bullshit. It's very faintly dog-based. Like not convincing enough that it forms it. You see like the metal is just perfectly mirror-finished. Like, itches down rough shapes of like what you're trying to, you know, count it.  Yeah. No. There's a really cool shield that's an exit. No. I'm like shaking it trying to... Okay.
3:11:36: Speaker_4: There's a really cool shield that's an exit.
3:11:38: Speaker_4: No. I'm like shaking it trying to... Okay.
3:11:43: Speaker_2: There's only how many uses of that?
3:11:45: Speaker_2: I can only fail three times.
3:11:46: Dungeon Master: And then just... Trick it three times. Three attempts just... Three failed attempts just wipe it clean. It doesn't destroy it. Oh, okay. No, that's against all the creatures you can use.
3:11:47: Speaker_2: And then just... Trick it three times.
3:11:49: Speaker_3: Three attempts just... Three failed attempts just wipe it clean.
3:11:55: Speaker_3: You've actually got in there.
3:11:57: Dungeon Master: No, like, yeah, total of three failed attempts.
3:11:57: Speaker_3: No, like, yeah, total of three failed attempts.
3:11:59: Speaker_3: and then it resets but you can keep telling it more stories again to get back up to the same is it a count if it's a truth that you just yeah don't lower check okay but if you fail that still counts to three yeah so that was my previous action so
3:12:39: Speaker_2: I'm pretty sure it was a three, too. Yeah. I was going to say a two, but... Oh, no, no, no, no.
3:12:40: Speaker_4: I was going to say a two, but... Oh, no, no, no, no. ...to the benefit of the doubt. We want to be fair. Yeah, we don't want to cut him short.
3:12:49: Speaker_4: 10... 15 to 10?
3:13:09: Speaker_2: Yeah, plus two. Yeah, the big guy's probably not super dexterous.
3:13:44: Speaker_4: I don't see any reason to get closer.
3:13:47: Speaker_4: I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to bring up tall lightning. I'm going to reach the top. How tall is this space? 80, 90 feet. All right. So I'll go to about 60 feet from the cavern, right about here in the center. And a big, dark storm cloud is going to appear. Lightning's going to begin to shoot out of it. And then it's going to shoot a bolt right down at this guy. He's going to need to make a DC
3:14:17: Speaker_4: a half of 3D Tim.
3:14:34: Speaker_4: If you want to make it easier, you can just say he fails. I'm just trying to see if I can connect right.
3:14:36: Dungeon Master: I'm just trying to see if I can connect right.
3:14:39: Speaker_4: Oh, DC 15 deaths.
3:14:42: Speaker_2: Jesse, you crack me up with that shit.
3:14:51: Dungeon Master: So 3D10. Lightning damage.
3:14:54: Dungeon Master: One.  Oh, what level is this spell? Level three. He gets advantage. Oh, don't do me like that. Lesser magic resistance. It gets advantage on saving throws to resist effects if spells cast at third level or lower. Ooh.
3:15:07: Speaker_3: Ooh. It's gonna be crucial.
3:15:11: Dungeon Master: Well, that changes what I might have done.
3:15:15: Speaker_4: Failure. Okay. All right, so it was a one, then it was a nine. Killed. Good for that. So 10, and then three.
3:15:24: Speaker_4: 13 lightning damage. And then... Doesn't he get stunned, though?
3:15:29: Speaker_2: Or that was only the toad for some reason.
3:15:45: Speaker_4: Okay, that's my turn. I will just... Maybe I'll move to, like,
3:15:58: Dungeon Master: For this space, I'm going to call 60. This is farther, so we'll say from this point here, we'll call that 80.
3:16:18: Dungeon Master: And then, obviously, I said this was 60 feet tall, so you don't have to do that again.
3:16:47: Speaker_3: I'm gonna go ahead and cast your image on myself And I'll move 30 feet I'm gonna I'm assuming this is I can just keep skirting the edge
3:17:26: Dungeon Master: gnarly old how and it will just this is Leopold right no I'm this is Leopold oh sorry sorry oh and how I didn't go ahead and give me
3:17:57: Dungeon Master: Ooh, natural one. It was good enough. I rolled a seven. Constitution-saving throws. You guys are close enough to the walls that all of those sort of lycanthropes and wolves that have been sort of subdued by its presence, at this moment, all are, like, coordinated to reach out and bite at you as you are running by. You're just close enough. Are there sort of, like, little holes that are popping out of those? They're popping out and getting, yeah. So you guys both get bit, but this is... Rats. These rats. Wait, so... Is it for damage, or is it for...
3:18:29: Dungeon Master: you should do it again yeah just to see uh 19 that's a con
3:18:29: Speaker_4: you should do it again yeah just to see uh 19 that's a con
3:18:32: Speaker_3: That was just from the walls? That was like, yeah, because I'm running around the edge. Yeah. There are apparently like small holes. Oh, the claws. It's almost like a dent. Next step is this.
3:18:44: Speaker_2: Yeah.
3:18:47: Speaker_2: Oh, the claws. It's almost like a dent. Next step is this.
3:18:52: Dungeon Master: We'll just call it a super werewolf for now. So should I assume, I'll assume that even though I was bitten.
3:18:54: Speaker_3: So should I assume, I'll assume that even though I was bitten.
3:18:58: Dungeon Master: Didn't like get purchased. The whole thing was like fail both something bad.  Succeed on the first one, you're fine. Succeed on the second one, you're fine. It's a double negative. That's what I'm just getting for not rolling hits. It'll be its turn.
3:19:18: Dungeon Master: On its turn, it can do a couple things. It'll use its Frightful Presence. Any creature it can see within 120 feet must make a DC 18 Wisdom Saver be frightened for one minute. I might be around the edge. 60, we'll call 10, so 70. And then...
3:19:38: Dungeon Master: What was it, 60?
3:19:46: Dungeon Master: I think you're right there.
3:19:47: Dungeon Master: Oh, I'm definitely, yeah.
3:19:49: Dungeon Master: Wisdom save. Wisdom?
3:19:50: Speaker_2: Wisdom save. That's a strong one for you.
3:19:52: Speaker_2: 14.
3:19:54: Speaker_2: Fail. This is a flat.
3:19:55: Speaker_3: 15. Roll it again.
3:20:02: Speaker_3: Roll it again? I guess it doesn't matter. Because you failed, so roll it again.  Oh, I thought the for saving throws or do I let's just check
3:20:15: Dungeon Master: So 15 I'm frightened yes both of you frightened until you succeed you can repeat the same at the end of each of your turns and once you succeed you Don't get it doesn't happen again frightened means they can't move towards you cannot move towards it and attack it with disadvantage One round one minute Okay, so make that save yeah, it's got 60 feet of movement, so it will just
3:20:41: Dungeon Master: leap no right to here standing leap 60 feet it's 20 feet tall on the uh on the bridge bridge you see it like its leg will get out and like uh throw itself into the air and sort of like picks itself up gets its balance and you take two attacks on leopold perfect good luck get ready to get that shield out i have one more
3:21:13: Speaker_3: I was burning a lot to get us out of that cave. It's gotta be a 21.
3:21:33: Dungeon Master: Still have to land it, don't worry. 16 plus 9. Ugh, shit.
3:21:56: Dungeon Master: That is so hard.
3:21:59: Dungeon Master: He goes to bite, and he's just like, the metal dinks and dents, and then it lets go and poof, back up.
3:22:06: Speaker_3: It's not used to not biting something with meat.
3:22:11: Speaker_3: For a lair action, yeah.
3:22:11: Speaker_2: For a lair action, yeah. For a legendary or whatever that was.
3:22:13: Speaker_3: For a legendary or whatever that was.
3:22:16: Speaker_2: Yeah, I wasn't going to deal with that.
3:22:21: Speaker_2: For my turn... Oh, Jesus.
3:22:27: Speaker_2: I got a laser sword.
3:22:33: Speaker_2: Yeah, so well I have disadvantage because I'm frightened do I also have like double disadvantage because I Would just be a zero
3:22:57: Speaker_2: Alright, so, uh, with disadvantage... I have one point of exhaustion, right?
3:23:05: Speaker_4: Oh! Oh, excellent, okay.
3:23:07: Speaker_2: Oh! Oh, excellent, okay.
3:23:10: Speaker_2: Well, in that case... Yeah, alright.
3:23:10: Speaker_3: Well, in that case... Yeah, alright.
3:23:13: Speaker_3: I thought I would've had double because... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3:23:14: Speaker_2: I thought I would've had double because... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3:23:20: Speaker_2: Got it.
3:23:21: Speaker_2: But, because I'm frightened, uh...
3:23:24: Speaker_2: Yeah, 7 plus 9, I don't think it's going to make contact there.
3:23:32: Speaker_2: 16 misses, great. And that will be my action. And my bonus action, I think I had one stone that I haven't thrown yet.
3:23:42: Speaker_2: Floating around. So with my bonus action, I will hurtle a stone. Disadvantage.
3:23:53: Speaker_2: Fuck. Natural 1. Are you gonna hit me with it?
3:23:58: Speaker_3: You're far enough away.
3:24:00: Speaker_2: I think it just goes wide. Yeah, it doesn't go wide.
3:24:01: Dungeon Master: Yeah, it doesn't go wide.
3:24:02: Speaker_3: Into the pit of werecreatures.
3:24:02: Dungeon Master: It just hits its leg because there's not enough space for it to get any momentum and it just falls to the ground. You see, like, it hits the ground like a werewolf. Runs out of the shadows, grabs it, and like, just like, like a ball. Thought it was a ball. Like that 50 cent opening pitch.
3:24:04: Speaker_3: It just hits its leg because there's not enough space for it to get any momentum and it just falls to the ground.
3:24:18: Dungeon Master: It's its last one.
3:24:23: Speaker_2: So a shield lasts for my... Doesn't it, don't worry about it.
3:24:26: Speaker_2: Okay.
3:24:27: Speaker_2: But I guess if it does, how long does a shield last? Until the start of your next turn. Okay, so basically any attacks would be? Yes.
3:24:30: Speaker_3: Until the start of your next turn.
3:24:33: Speaker_3: It's a nice one for the whole round.
3:24:36: Speaker_4: Oh, me? Yes, do you want?
3:25:28: Dungeon Master: Okay, I was gonna say I hear the cell phone
3:25:44: Speaker_2: Is it an action?
3:25:45: Speaker_2: I wonder what the next Zelda game will be. Yes. Okay. They'll probably put one out soon, right?
3:25:45: Dungeon Master: I wonder what the next Zelda game will be.
3:25:46: Dungeon Master: Yes. Okay.
3:25:49: Dungeon Master: They just made like a kid's version.
3:25:52: Speaker_3: It's all princess stuff. She's Peach's, not Peach. Zelda. It would be Zelda, yeah.
3:25:57: Speaker_2: Zelda. It would be Zelda, yeah. Primary character.
3:25:59: Dungeon Master: Primary character.
3:26:00: Speaker_2: Interesting. But it's a cartoon? Every other game they kind of switch off.
3:26:00: Dungeon Master: But it's a cartoon? Every other game they kind of switch off. We just didn't know because  I feel like it's got to be time for a new Super Smash too.
3:26:14: Speaker_2: It's been years since I put one out.
3:26:37: Speaker_3: I'll use my 30 feet of movement.
3:26:40: Speaker_3: This is easy within the 60. Yeah, 60 feet is about my pencil. Am I at 60 feet right now?
3:26:48: Speaker_3: No.
3:26:53: Speaker_3: Okay, but if I move... If you move a little bit forward, you would be. I took my whole 30 feet to here.
3:27:00: Speaker_3: Oh, I didn't roll for saving fear.
3:27:00: Speaker_4: Go for it. Oh, neither did I, actually.
3:27:04: Speaker_2: Oh, neither did I, actually.
3:27:09: Speaker_2: But then I would have disadvantage because this is a check. No, it's a save. No, okay, God, that's confusing that a lot of me. Eleven. Eleven?
3:27:09: Speaker_3: But then I would have disadvantage because this is a check.
3:27:11: Speaker_3: No, it's a save.
3:27:12: Speaker_3: No, okay, God, that's confusing that a lot of me.
3:27:16: Speaker_4: In combat, it's almost never going to be relevant unless it's a strength, a contested strength. Ah, okay. So that's a good way to remember it. Okay. So we're in combat, it almost never is relevant.
3:27:23: Dungeon Master: So we're in combat, it almost never is relevant. Yeah, that's good.
3:27:27: Dungeon Master: What's the cavern height here 80 feet
3:27:52: Speaker_2: And so anti-grav literally just flips the gravity?
3:27:52: Dungeon Master: And so anti-grav literally just flips the gravity?
3:27:56: Dungeon Master: Yeah. Just floats it. Use the action to throw the sphere up to 60 feet where it shatters and casts levitate on all creatures. Spell save DC 15 and objects within 15 foot radius lasting for one minute. No concentration required.
3:28:10: Dungeon Master: Oh, it's levitate? Levitate. Oh, it's not reverse gravity? It's not a 9th level spell, no. Sorry. Is it only like 10, 15, 20? What's levitate? Levitate is you don't go up. You just stop moving where you are. And you can't, unless you get like telepathically fly spacesuit. Restraint. Pretty much, yeah. We've got him restrained within a space. It can move, but like if it jumped into the air, it would just keep going that way. Because it can't control its space.  It would be like an air hockey puck. It can just push in a way and it can't stop itself. In theory. There'd be some checks to be made.
3:28:11: Speaker_3: Oh, it's levitate? Levitate. Oh, it's not reverse gravity? It's not a 9th level spell, no.
3:28:17: Speaker_3: Sorry. Is it only like 10, 15, 20?
3:28:32: Speaker_3: It can move, but like if it jumped into the air, it would just keep going that way.
3:28:51: Speaker_3: Would you throw it? I'd throw it. It's got to make a deck save, it looks like. No, no, no, my strength. Actually, I don't know. I just said the DC 15. I said the DC 15 right now.
3:28:55: Dungeon Master: No, no, no, my strength. Actually, I don't know.
3:29:03: Speaker_3: That's just what I wrote down from the session, because we didn't have the objects yet.
3:29:12: Speaker_3: No, wouldn't be right. Getting affected? No, it's because Charisma affects... It's a Constitution saving throw. It is a Constitution saving throw. Unwilling creature must succeed in Constitution saving throw.
3:29:18: Dungeon Master: It is a Constitution saving throw. Unwilling creature must succeed in Constitution saving throw.
3:29:20: Speaker_4: I figured it would have been like a Strength check. My thought, yeah, if it was Reverse Gravity, I would have thought Strength to dex, but since it's just Levitate, it's just an effect that happens. Because you're just trying to resist it? Yeah, I guess because you can save against it and then nothing happens, versus Reverse Gravity where everything flips.
3:29:21: Speaker_3: I figured it would have been like a Strength check.
3:29:30: Speaker_2: Yeah, I guess because you can save against it and then nothing happens, versus Reverse Gravity where everything flips.
3:29:35: Dungeon Master: Levitate is a second level spell, so I'll get advantage.  And it's... I don't like this cow. 16 and 18, I'm gonna die.
3:30:08: Speaker_2: What I'm rolling here? I got a decently high con.
3:30:10: Speaker_3: I got a decently high con.
3:30:12: Speaker_2: 16, yeah, 22. Okay, roll 1d4 damage.
3:30:16: Dungeon Master: Okay, roll 1d4 damage.
3:30:17: Dungeon Master: Roll that damage. 4, 3, 2. That's a Sam Riegel style one right there.
3:30:39: Dungeon Master: You see a couple of slashes in its body sort of close and heal up a little bit. This guy's healing. Yeah, we didn't really do that.
3:30:52: Speaker_2: I guess we had no time. We just took off.
3:30:57: Dungeon Master: It started its turn. It recharges its fight.
3:31:02: Dungeon Master: but it will use um it'll use its frightful presence again so you uh already succeeded i'm still frightened still frightened so but it doesn't affect you again you need to make it round what is the save this time it's a dc18 wisdom save
3:31:17: Speaker_2: So once you succeed, it can affect you again? Yeah. For the fight? Yeah. 24 hours, but for all intents and purposes.
3:31:20: Dungeon Master: Yeah.
3:31:24: Speaker_3: You're like, I already saw you, buddy. I already know. I know what you do. That's pretty neat.
3:31:28: Speaker_3: My shield's scary. Would you call it an 18? 18. Got it. 30, 20. Nice.  Yeah, my wisdom is I think I did a 21 well has it been the start of my turn so 26 is the AC
3:31:56: Dungeon Master: Well, that's its turn. At the end of its turn, it'll use two legendary actions to bite you.
3:32:04: Dungeon Master: Yeah. You're the only one in front of it. 17 plus 9, 26.
3:32:09: Speaker_2: 26. Beats it first to break that barrier.
3:32:11: Speaker_3: That's a high roll.
3:32:15: Speaker_2: I know, man.
3:32:15: Speaker_3: I know, man.
3:32:17: Speaker_3: It's really hard to hit you.
3:32:24: Speaker_3: You're only level 6 and you've got a plus 8 on your modifier. Yeah, that's wild.
3:32:31: Speaker_3: Yeah.
3:32:32: Dungeon Master: You take 13 piercing damage and give me a constitution saving throw.
3:32:54: Speaker_2: Uh, 12.
3:32:58: Speaker_2: Can you turn a suit of armor into a were-creature?
3:33:02: Dungeon Master: You don't have blood, technically correct. No. So you will not be cursed unless you want to be, technically you would be, but you still take 86 necrotic damage.
3:33:03: Speaker_2: You don't have blood, technically correct.
3:33:05: Speaker_2: No. So you will not be cursed unless you want to be, technically you would be, but you still take 86 necrotic damage.
3:33:13: Dungeon Master: That's a lot of 1s. It's okay, middle of the row, he's got some 3s in there, that's not bad.
3:33:14: Speaker_3: It's okay, middle of the row, he's got some 3s in there, that's not bad. 9, 12, 17,
3:33:58: Speaker_2: Let's see, Burning Hands is just touch, so it's not like a roll to hit.
3:34:04: Speaker_4: Well, it is, but you have to be able to touch it. Yeah, you can't be five feet away.
3:34:09: Speaker_2: Yeah, I'm, right? Yeah, you're there. It works. But I'm not going to roll to hit something. They're just going to have to pass a deck save. Oh, yes. Yes.
3:34:11: Speaker_4: It works. But I'm not going to roll to hit something.
3:34:19: Speaker_2: Yeah, I will cast Burning Hands at the second level.
3:34:27: Speaker_2: It's a dex save. 15 foot cone.
3:34:34: Speaker_2: When I cast it at the second level or higher the damage increases by 1d6 for each level above the first. So you got an 18.
3:34:40: Dungeon Master: So you got an 18.
3:34:43: Speaker_2: Yeah it's a 16 so they save. Half damage?
3:34:47: Speaker_2: That would be, yeah, half damage.  And 3d6. And since I did it at the second level, it would be 4d6, but halved.
3:35:01: Speaker_2: Okay.
3:35:23: Speaker_2: Six yeah, that was already half so it was 12 initially My bonus action I will bring up another magic stone and that will be over my turn Yeah, we gotta figure out how to hit this guy After your turn all these
3:35:44: Dungeon Master: It's last legendary action to make another claw attack at you.
3:35:49: Dungeon Master: But you see that you threw the fire at it, and sort of up into its face, and it makes this attack not looking at you, and swipes sort of wildly.
3:35:50: Speaker_3: But you see that you threw the fire at it, and sort of up into its face, and it makes this attack not looking at you, and swipes sort of wildly.
3:35:59: Speaker_2: I was also going to roll to get rid of the fear.
3:36:02: Dungeon Master: Go ahead. 17?
3:36:04: Speaker_2: Nine to hit. 12 to hit.
3:36:07: Speaker_2: 12 does not hit.
3:36:07: Dungeon Master: 12 does not hit.
3:36:09: Speaker_2: Uh, 17 on the... 17 fails.
3:36:13: Dungeon Master: Oh! Really? DC 18 save.
3:36:17: Speaker_2: Oh god, and I have a flat roll, so that's... We're gonna need to help you.
3:36:19: Dungeon Master: That's impossible. It's cross-act with a nat 20 and a 3, and it has to roll disadvantage because of the fire damage. Yeah, that's why I was like, oof.
3:36:20: Speaker_2: That's impossible. It's cross-act with a nat 20 and a 3, and it has to roll disadvantage because of the fire damage.
3:36:29: Dungeon Master: Keep it in with fire. Yep, roger.
3:36:33: Dungeon Master: At the start of the round, thoroughly, you are up.
3:36:38: Speaker_4: I'm going to have to do something like that. I'm going to drop it. I'm going to move in. I'm going to use my action to transfer to my bear form. Bonus action. Beforehand, I'm going to bring out my flaming claws.
3:37:13: Speaker_4: I'm gonna be snipping. See what I can do.
3:37:20: Speaker_2: You can't attack him, though?
3:37:29: Dungeon Master: At the start of the round, it should have been the werewolf on the walls donating, give me a dexterity saving throw.
3:37:39: Dungeon Master: Should I have one too? No, you moved away. That's a 14 on the dex.
3:37:53: Speaker_3: I do like the idea of transforming into a metal werewolf.
3:37:54: Speaker_2: Yeah, so that's just a metal like I'm gonna use
3:37:55: Speaker_3: Yeah, so that's just a metal like I'm gonna use
3:38:11: Speaker_3: Right now, having been in the tunnel and sort of realizing that what felt very intuitive, like very protective whenever those blasts came out of my hands, I'm going to do the same thing again.
3:38:25: Speaker_3: I'm going to raise my hand and cast this Optric Blast.
3:38:30: Speaker_3: That'll be a 23 to hit.
3:38:35: Speaker_3: And a natural one.
3:38:43: Speaker_3: Nine. I'm going to close. Can I move 30 feet forward? Yeah. Will that put me? That's not going to quite get me. I'll be like here. I'm going to use a feature from light splitter. The arc. One where it's like two things just like fly out of the light.
3:39:15: Speaker_3: Yeah, arc slash gives me a ranged attack now.
3:39:21: Speaker_3: Do I still use my weapon modifier, my dex modifier for that? It's just a normal attack, you can do any difference. Okay, okay. You only need to use it once. You can only activate it once. Right, right, right.
3:39:33: Speaker_3: That'll be a...
3:39:43: Speaker_3: that do any elemental no it just it just gives me like it just gives me like one time like range weapon oh nice but that's nice that hits for a max damage
3:39:59: Dungeon Master: You always get the addition of the radiant or necrotic on the bonus. Which are you dealing? Radiant.
3:40:08: Dungeon Master: So that was 10, 14, 19? Yeah. Nice. No, no, no.
3:40:10: Speaker_3: My plus is a 3.
3:40:13: Speaker_3: Good round. Next up will be its turn.
3:40:21: Dungeon Master: Yeah, he's dinged up.
3:40:36: Dungeon Master: Oh, this is where the exhaustion would come into play. This is a check.
3:40:40: Speaker_4: This is a check.
3:40:53: Speaker_4: Well, I mean, there's other... Yeah, yeah, I'm not gonna win that.
3:41:03: Dungeon Master: Five. A 25. Close. It doesn't do any damage on the attack itself, but if you get this way, you will fall 60 feet on your turn and hit the ground.  unless you have a way to change that, but you are currently following and it'll use its second attack.
3:41:23: Dungeon Master: I can use my reaction to cast Feather Fall.
3:41:23: Speaker_3: I can use my reaction to cast Feather Fall.
3:41:32: Dungeon Master: Yeah, choose up to five, you and five creatures.
3:41:33: Speaker_3: Yeah, choose up to five, you and five creatures. Yeah. Okay. What's the range? I'm a creature. Sixty feet. Nice, okay. It's a good reaction. Oh, it's a fantastic reaction. I was going to say, I was going to have to work with something else.
3:41:42: Speaker_4: Oh, it's a fantastic reaction.
3:41:48: Dungeon Master: Mark your bow.
3:41:52: Dungeon Master: Oh, thanks.
3:41:53: Speaker_2: I have one ace, one ace in my pocket for that, but... I was thinking you could shoot your steel defender straight down and have it, like, rocket you back down.
3:41:53: Speaker_4: I have one ace, one ace in my pocket for that, but... I was thinking you could shoot your steel defender straight down and have it, like, rocket you back down.
3:42:04: Dungeon Master: Just a little bit.
3:42:32: Speaker_3: So she's just the one effect, because I've got no level one to basically mean I don't take any damage.
3:42:39: Speaker_2: You'll move forward to close the distance with Kaladin, so you get an attack of opportunity.
3:42:39: Dungeon Master: You'll move forward to close the distance with Kaladin, so you get an attack of opportunity.
3:42:45: Dungeon Master: OK, so what did we decide with the bear? If I cast a one attack, because that's what the weapon thing is, and you said the bonus was about the same anyway. Yeah. Well, so if I do a regular attack as a bear,
3:43:02: Speaker_4: I do way more damage than with the thing, so can I just add a little bit of fire to my regular attacks instead? Just do it that way?
3:43:14: Speaker_4: No.
3:43:15: Dungeon Master: Probably agree on that one. Well, then I'm just not going to cast it. But the fire gives it disadvantage on its next attack.
3:43:22: Dungeon Master: Yeah, I guess that's fair.
3:43:40: Speaker_3: My attack, shield or two? No, no, no. Let me, I've got your image. Let me see if it needs one. Oh, yeah.
3:43:53: Speaker_4: Actually it's a dirty point because this creature is large. So that's going to be 3d6 fire damage. 3, 4, so 7. 12 fire damage as I... right across its booty. And then with sentinel...
3:44:23: Dungeon Master: Yeah Just start spraying lightning breath. Yeah good. Oh where dragon would be fucking nuts. Oh
3:44:56: Dungeon Master: Eliot, your turn. You were falling, you fall half speed I believe, so you will make it halfway to the ground on your turn, but you have full control of your body, you're not falling with imminent danger. If I land on the ground I won't take damage. You won't take damage, but you won't hit the ground on your turn either.
3:45:08: Speaker_2: You won't take damage, but you won't hit the ground on your turn either.
3:45:24: Speaker_3: your turn okay and I still have a little bit of sight onto this creature up here yes it's 60 feet up but it's like you can see like the top half of his shoulder.
3:45:42: Speaker_3: Dude, I have one option to get out of that hole.
3:45:46: Speaker_3: I'm just going to have a fun time down there.
3:45:54: Speaker_2: There's many of the smaller werewolves in the base of this pit. Yeah, so you hit your turn, you start it by the end of it, you hit the comic, as you're going down you see they're just lined all the way around the perimeter, watching and waiting patiently for something to fall into the pit.
3:45:57: Dungeon Master: Yeah, so you hit your turn, you start it by the end of it, you hit the comic, as you're going down you see they're just lined all the way around the perimeter, watching and waiting patiently for something to fall into the pit.
3:46:10: Speaker_2: Right, great. They're probably going to be nice.
3:46:15: Speaker_2: Yeah, I was thinking that too. Probably just car wash.
3:46:17: Speaker_4: Probably just car wash.
3:46:40: Speaker_3: Firebolt, is that a cantrip you have?
3:46:42: Speaker_2: Yeah, I was thinking about that, but if I'm... If I'm stuck in a pit with thousands of little creatures that are gonna tear me up, I don't... I don't know what your AoE effect is gonna be, so that's gonna blast them all away from you.
3:46:54: Speaker_2: I don't have anything. I mean, I have Thunderwave, but... I don't think that would even really... No, it's just a 45 degree angle in front of you.
3:47:00: Speaker_3: That's all you're protecting.
3:47:06: Speaker_3: How much death points does...  I was trying to track my I think I only have two but yeah two okay what I will do
3:47:30: Speaker_2: Oh, did I miss one? Because I thought I had it.
3:47:33: Dungeon Master: You all had one pretty early on, and then you went the longest with that one, but you did use one to heal somebody.
3:47:41: Dungeon Master: Oh, I did? So that was the second one. Okay. And he touched the beam. And he touched the beam for three. So three, yeah. Yeah, he just beamed, so I got my fourth.
3:47:41: Speaker_3: Oh, I did?
3:47:43: Speaker_3: Okay. And he touched the beam.
3:47:45: Speaker_2: Yeah, he just beamed, so I got my fourth.
3:47:48: Speaker_2: Let me add one there. Remember, you can heal people with your own hits.
3:47:50: Dungeon Master: Remember, you can heal people with your own hits.
3:47:58: Dungeon Master: I am gonna scream pocket sand and I'm just gonna start spraying fog out of my cufflinks and disappear I'm casting fog cloud at the second level
3:47:58: Speaker_2: I am gonna scream pocket sand and I'm just gonna start spraying fog out of my cufflinks and disappear I'm casting fog cloud at the second level
3:48:24: Speaker_2: I'm disappearing into a cloud of fog. No one sees you.
3:48:30: Speaker_2: It says, uh...
3:48:34: Speaker_2: You create a 20-foot radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range. That point is directly on me. Sphere is heavily obscured. So, presumably these creatures can't see me.
3:48:58: Speaker_2: Because I'm like right here next to the wall somewhere. I'm going to start trying to climb that column.
3:49:27: Dungeon Master: You start moving up the wall.
3:49:30: Dungeon Master: You can do it. At the start of the round, because you are in the pit still, you see one wolf sort of walks out snarling.
3:49:41: Speaker_2: I'm heavily obscured. I can't see anything.
3:49:43: Dungeon Master: They can't see me! Don't tell me what happens, just make it happen. Okay.  ankles are getting big.
3:49:45: Speaker_2: Don't tell me what happens, just make it happen.
3:49:48: Speaker_3: Okay.
3:50:01: Speaker_3: It just doesn't smell right.
3:50:20: Speaker_2: Ten.
3:50:21: Speaker_2: Ten, give me a constitution saving throw.
3:50:26: Speaker_2: That's a little higher. But I'm already cursed.
3:50:30: Speaker_3: No, you're not cursed.
3:50:30: Speaker_3: You decided that you couldn't, but you'll still take a little.
3:50:36: Dungeon Master: Yeah, that'll be 15.
3:50:37: Dungeon Master: I think it's like a 12. It's not as good as his.
3:50:42: Dungeon Master: His is different.
3:50:49: Dungeon Master: You're climbing up this obscured area, you can barely, you're like reaching up blindly, you see like this just mouth and jaw and teeth just up in the smoke, grabs your foot, falls down, disappears from the smoke as you hear the snarling like up at the very top of this aureole.
3:51:06: Dungeon Master: I'm gonna move you to this guy's space here.
3:51:09: Speaker_4: I'm gonna make my attack assume limited advantage.
3:51:48: Speaker_3: He's already been hit with fire right now, right? So his next attack is... Not on Misty. Okay. I'll Misty Step backwards.
3:51:57: Speaker_3: Okay. So not that I'm so close to the wall to trigger that effect, but to back up. Okay. I'll cast Firebolt.
3:52:15: Speaker_3: It's like a fruit claw.
3:52:21: Speaker_3: Cool, cool, cool. That was bonus action and action. That's how I feel. I'm just trying to set that up so it wouldn't be so bad.
3:52:30: Speaker_4: It's all right.
3:52:33: Speaker_4: I'm the only one he can hit right now, so it'll be all right. I'm already cursed too, so it's a really best case scenario.
3:52:56: Dungeon Master: Start of the wolf's turn does not get a fight back. It'll, you see, like, clumsily turn, almost slipping, back to face you and it'll hit.  More points than I got.
3:53:50: Dungeon Master: Nine slashing damage, and then... You don't need all those.
3:54:09: Dungeon Master: You are considered staggered for this round. When staggered, a character has disadvantage on attack rolls and spell saves.  Oh Jonathan speaking of effects, can I roll for the frame?
3:54:34: Speaker_4: I would be moving closer by climbing up here.
3:54:36: Speaker_2: I'm just hiding in this cloud.
3:54:57: Speaker_3: It's like a quiet place, just don't move. Just don't move. Or have, you know, a chicken in your... In your chest cavity.
3:55:06: Dungeon Master: You take 11 slashing, and then another con save, because it hit you both times.
3:55:13: Dungeon Master: What? Oh, it hit me again? Well, it hit you with both attacks, right? Oh, yeah, because I'm up here. Both per claw, so I needed a con save. Oh, I thought those two were the damage, right? Because I don't know, it was just the one. Shit, I might not be aware of that.  Uh, 19, 20, and 2. Oh, that's 16. So you take half damage. So it was 8, 10, 11, half to 5. So it was 11 for the first and then 5 for the second.
3:55:43: Dungeon Master: I'm doing absolutely fine.
3:55:43: Dungeon Master: Okay. End of your turn, end of its turn, um, it'll use a, like, carry action. I can't swipe at you. Just, you might as well.
3:56:02: Speaker_2: put that little hat in front of its claw I think I'm trying to take a duck top of the round it'll be the initiative
3:56:18: Dungeon Master: How is this creature looking?
3:56:19: Speaker_2: I think I've hit it once or twice.
3:56:22: Speaker_3: Yeah, I probably did about 10. I can't even get any closer.
3:56:43: Dungeon Master: Well, that's plus 220 By a random werewolf that could have found me in the smoke All right, so I'm not a bear I
3:56:50: Speaker_3: Well, that's plus 220 By a random werewolf that could have found me in the smoke All right, so I'm not a bear I
3:57:20: Speaker_2: I only have one more spell slot.
3:57:26: Speaker_3: I have one second level spell slot. Same. This is where... But I mean, I've still got Flame Blade up. I need a couple more because I'm multi-classed. Like, as soon as I've got two attacks, you're a fighter.
3:57:28: Speaker_2: Same.
3:57:37: Speaker_3: Yeah, that would be nice. We'll start opening up.  We got this. I'm not worried one bit. We've got so many syringes now. So yeah, I'll attack him with the flame wave.
3:57:49: Dungeon Master: He's got a lot. He's got a lot.
3:57:52: Dungeon Master: And he's healing. I'm not thinking, I'm not hearing. Lo siento.
3:58:07: Speaker_3: So he's been healing, remember? I'll still try to hit him. That's why I tried to hit him with fire. Uh, 25 to hit. Does the fire prevent him from healing? I think it just gives him disadvantage.
3:58:25: Speaker_2: The fire helps a lot, but I don't know if it helps.
3:58:28: Dungeon Master: Gives it disadvantage on its next attack. Everybody go ahead and give me a Perception or Insight Check.
3:58:38: Speaker_2: solidly zeros. Doesn't matter which one. Fourteen? Twenty-four.
3:58:42: Dungeon Master: Twenty-four.
3:58:42: Dungeon Master: Twenty-five.
3:58:48: Dungeon Master: The fire is definitely like, it's afraid of the fire to some extent, where it gets a little hesitant after each fire attack. You notice that it's regularly healing a significant portion with your guys' attack, even magical. So we probably need to get the silver. No, I got this.
3:59:04: Dungeon Master: We just need to get it.
3:59:48: Speaker_3: That's a total to dead thing. It's going to be a 14 damage.
3:59:54: Speaker_3: Like ice.
3:59:55: Dungeon Master: Yeah, it's necrotic damage. I will read it to you and I'll let you judge it to see which takes precedence. The blank werewolf, as I'm about to tell you, regenerates 20 HP.
4:00:15: Speaker_3: so you don't lose some saving throw or take necrotic damage. If target fails, it said it takes that much.
4:00:25: Speaker_3: Oh wait, where's the letter? Oh, did they change the rules on this one?
4:00:38: Dungeon Master: You can use both. You can check the old one. It's one of those you can change out for if you'd like. Oh, that's terrible.
4:00:44: Dungeon Master: Did they make this new?
4:00:47: Speaker_2: because they release an update oh shit okay do they get better
4:00:59: Dungeon Master: I feel like the monk was kind of tough sometimes.
4:01:02: Speaker_2: You're like god damn it. Yeah, so in the legacy one, I feel like they're not allowed to regenerate.
4:01:10: Speaker_3: Oh, is that chill touch? That's what I was thinking of.
4:01:15: Speaker_3: Oh yeah, touch active.
4:01:16: Speaker_4: So they have to be, they have to be damaged by a silver weapon.
4:01:16: Speaker_3: So they have to be, they have to be damaged by a silver weapon.
4:01:17: Speaker_2: I was thinking chill touch. Which we don't have.
4:01:18: Speaker_4: I was thinking chill touch.
4:01:20: Speaker_4: Which we don't have.
4:01:33: Dungeon Master: have a way to stop it from healing that's good so I was looking at my equipment and for something silver and in my inventory once you showed me how to make things in my own inventory I wrote long dong silver what is that it's like long
4:02:16: Speaker_2: Ah yeah, that's what I'm here for.
4:02:38: Dungeon Master: That was action.
4:02:42: Speaker_3: that was okay um next is those guys sorry guys i had the wrong spell in my head the wolf that's all right does it get it spiked it's not it will take attacks on zarya right there this thing's probably healed more than we've damaged it first one is a
4:03:13: Dungeon Master: shield it brought me to a 19 and since this thing's big I'm at a 20.
4:03:21: Dungeon Master: Why do you have a buff to things that are large?
4:03:26: Dungeon Master: Oh your giant slayer ring nice I also have a plus one to hit
4:03:43: Dungeon Master: 9 plus 5 14 points of slashing damage But it doesn't I'm gonna say it doesn't do the necrotic thing when it's not as strong as you want it to be. Leopold, bottom of the pit.
4:04:03: Speaker_4: Uh... You should just spin yourself so you don't know which direction you're going.
4:04:11: Speaker_3: You don't know where you're going.
4:04:15: Speaker_2: I'm not frightened of the fog in front of me, so... You could, like, make a run and jump for above the wall and try to climb farther away from it.
4:04:20: Dungeon Master: So the fog was a 20-foot radius, I guess.
4:04:27: Speaker_2: So the fog was a 20-foot radius, I guess. So my pencil is 60, so we'll say a third of it.
4:04:30: Dungeon Master: So my pencil is 60, so we'll say a third of it.
4:04:36: Dungeon Master: The fog gets up out to the wall.
4:04:37: Speaker_2: Okay, so I'd be obscured.
4:04:41: Speaker_2: Uh, yeah. I'll go that direction.
4:04:41: Dungeon Master: Uh, yeah.
4:04:44: Speaker_2: and i'll start climbing you want to jump before you get to the wall yeah try to give me a little little height and then you don't jump onto you don't run into a wolf oh yeah yeah for sure and uh
4:04:56: Dungeon Master: I guess as my action or bonus action, I've got some climbing pitons.
4:04:57: Speaker_2: I guess as my action or bonus action, I've got some climbing pitons.
4:05:03: Dungeon Master: I can't start throwing those in the wall, you know, just give me a little bit so I won't fall down.
4:05:06: Speaker_2: I can't start throwing those in the wall, you know, just give me a little bit so I won't fall down.
4:05:16: Speaker_2: So something to give me a little bit with disadvantage, okay, yeah.
4:05:22: Speaker_2: That would be ten.
4:05:24: Dungeon Master: You can start putting some pitons in, but you're going to move half pace. Okay. I've got a little hammer.
4:05:29: Speaker_2: Okay. I've got a little hammer.
4:05:32: Dungeon Master: You're technically only five feet up on the wall, so you're like sneaking on a wolf to do this.
4:05:42: Speaker_2: I'm sinking some handholds in there. So I'm going to move half speed. Can I use my action to dash then?
4:05:51: Speaker_2: Yeah.
4:05:52: Speaker_2: Okay, so I'll move 30 feet, so I'm halfway up the wall. I guess I'm now no longer obscured.
4:05:59: Dungeon Master: Not if you're 25 feet from the top of the wall.
4:06:01: Speaker_2: And the wolves down below me are stuck in that fog, circling.
4:06:09: Dungeon Master: End of the round. Nobody is close enough to get fit. Top of the round, Zario.
4:06:16: Dungeon Master: I'm close enough to get fit.
4:06:17: Speaker_3: No, the player action, the walls. Oh, oh, gotcha, gotcha.
4:06:19: Speaker_4: Oh, oh, gotcha, gotcha.
4:06:20: Speaker_4: Uh, yeah.
4:06:23: Speaker_3: okay um i was so excited about that cantrip guys yeah you went oh it was like you had my number  I've used that to essentially take down Ice Giants and shit. Oh, because Ice Giants will heal.
4:06:34: Speaker_2: They'll regenerate. And so it's like an overpowered cantrip in certain situations where it just takes away this... They can't reach in?
4:06:35: Speaker_3: They'll regenerate.
4:06:37: Speaker_3: And so it's like an overpowered cantrip in certain situations where it just takes away this... They can't reach in?
4:06:42: Speaker_3: They can't get hit points back.
4:06:45: Speaker_2: Yeah, I mean... I usually switch out Chill Touch and Shocking Grasp.
4:06:45: Speaker_3: Shocking Grasp is a good one too. Both two are good, cool.
4:06:49: Speaker_2: Shocking Grasp is a good one too.
4:06:56: Speaker_2: Yeah, I uh, unfortunately don't have anything silver.
4:07:01: Speaker_3: We have the necklaces technically. She threw a few. I'm assuming we may all have a necklace. Sure. We're just gonna have to burn actions like flint it onto the weapon or something.
4:07:13: Speaker_3: I'm just saying.
4:07:15: Speaker_3: It's gonna be wild.
4:07:15: Speaker_3: It's gonna be...
4:07:44: Dungeon Master: Um, are you wild shaped?
4:07:47: Dungeon Master: No. Oh, gotcha. Plus I only have one attack. Get the flame blade, but you also have some multi-attack.
4:07:52: Dungeon Master: It's not right. Yeah, but I still have flame blade though.
4:07:56: Dungeon Master: Well, so you can do either. You can either do the fire damage or the multi-attack going forward on that. Oh, okay. Cause since they're like interchangeable damage wise, there wasn't a benefit of doing one, but I'm not going to say you can do a multi-attack with fire damage.  so one or the other you get the versatility of that yeah no i'm just neat uh i'm gonna use my bonus roll to save for the fear
4:08:22: Speaker_3: That's a huge number. Yeah, I know, it's tough.
4:08:27: Speaker_2: Yeah, I know, it's tough. 18, and I have plus zero, so. Bonus action.
4:08:32: Speaker_3: Bonus action. This object blasts. That's the first one of the three it's going to miss. Second one it's going to also miss out of five. I'll run forward and try to hit it with the knife player. Yep. That's going to maybe hit at 21.
4:08:59: Speaker_3: It's alright, we're swinging some damage there. That's 13 plus, no, 12 plus 3, 15. Okay. That's all I can do now.
4:09:06: Speaker_3: I'm right up next to him because I ran forward to hit him.
4:09:12: Dungeon Master: Stardust turn. You see that slash sort of catches up and the fur replaces. A little bit of blood smear, but it seems to heal still.
4:09:24: Dungeon Master: It will roll
4:09:48: Speaker_3: No it didn't, but I don't think I would have rolled.
4:09:53: Dungeon Master: It will do a slash on both of you.
4:09:57: Dungeon Master: It's not feeling super threatened in the moment. What? Not feeling threatened? A miss on Zariel. Okay.
4:10:09: Dungeon Master: uh 18 meets beats it but it hits a decoy hits a mirror perfect end of its turn it'll do two legendary actions to bite it was facing this way at the end of its turn it will bite you
4:10:27: Dungeon Master: 21.
4:10:31: Dungeon Master: Hits another two. Nice. Fantastic. After that, you get both. So you get to fucking hit everyone.
4:10:48: Speaker_2: Yeah, that's what I was I was gonna I was gonna catapult. Yeah, I have one I'm gonna let's say I'm gonna I'm gonna shotgun
4:10:51: Speaker_3: Yeah, I have one I'm gonna let's say I'm gonna I'm gonna shotgun
4:11:08: Speaker_2: At level two is my only remaining spell slot. I'm gonna just like start Hucking silver coins down my my goal it See how much silver do I have I had a 50 I'll send I'll send 10 down and you'll just kind of Bring on ten silver pieces will go buckshot towards him
4:11:34: Speaker_2: uh... i think it is a uh... it's a dex save sixteen second level so it fails uh...
4:11:59: Speaker_2: uh... to to uh... objects race targets stops moving when the object strike something it's three d eight bludgeoning damage you want but it was more than a half of the flavor uh... or at higher levels uh... forty-eight forty-eight it's yeah
4:12:33: Speaker_2: uh... ten uh... shift fifteen uh... he doesn't feel for it was a little further forever for sure that's how i was never stopped i do not have the ability to do that again so uh...
4:12:58: Speaker_2: That was my attack. For my bonus action, I will animate some magic stones.
4:13:09: Dungeon Master: And that's my turn. At the end of your turn, it'll use its last legendary action and take a swipe at you. 26 to hit.
4:13:16: Dungeon Master: Has anyone rolling these with disadvantage?
4:13:22: Dungeon Master: The wolf.
4:13:39: Speaker_3: I'm so afraid of this guy.
4:13:40: Dungeon Master: I'm so afraid of this guy.
4:14:05: Speaker_2: Yeah, that's what mine's at.
4:14:18: Dungeon Master: That's fairly fitting for Leoblanc. It's kind of scary. It's the end of the round. Nobody continues as a victor. Green each when nothing happens. Start of it is Zarya. All right. I might swap. I don't know.
4:14:31: Speaker_4: I'm going to draw a little spirit fire.
4:14:37: Speaker_4: First level. No spell we can possibly cast is going to be above the third. 19 plus three.
4:14:43: Dungeon Master: All right, nothing happens.
4:14:46: Speaker_4: And I don't have any more objections.
4:14:58: Speaker_4: Alright. Yep, that's it.
4:15:01: Speaker_2: Was that, like, Pokemon Trainer Death Metal? That was also the Legend of Zelda one. Oh, that was Zelda, okay.
4:15:03: Dungeon Master: That was also the Legend of Zelda one.
4:15:04: Dungeon Master: Oh, that was Zelda, okay.
4:15:07: Dungeon Master: Alright, yeah, that's all I got. Okay.
4:15:12: Dungeon Master: Oh, well, I have movement, right? So I will move up to the ledge, but depending on how much did I have? Okay, I'm gonna I'm just gonna I'm gonna cling to the very top edge I'm not gonna pop over and stand so that way I'm still isolated from the
4:15:53: Speaker_3: All I can do is swing one time.
4:15:57: Dungeon Master: You can swing and then also bonus action do that thing. I know, that's with disadvantage.
4:16:04: Dungeon Master: Disadvantage is better than nothing.
4:16:15: Speaker_3: And that's a 14 hit? Yeah, advantage. Oh, advantage, yeah, that's good.
4:16:23: Speaker_3: That's hard. A little bonus action misty step for the last time.
4:16:32: Speaker_3: Just far enough away again just to be able to do this object blast. I'm just rolling both dice for each hit. One's going to hit, one's going to miss. 17 plus 7 hits. 11 misses. That'll be 7 force damage.
4:17:06: Dungeon Master: Start of its turn, does not heal.
4:17:10: Dungeon Master: It will see if it gets its fight back. It does. Spin around clumsily on this, and it'll take its two attacks on you. Good luck. Yeah.
4:17:28: Dungeon Master: Nope.  Second one, natural 20. What's it at? Going down. 29. Jeez. Give me a con save.
4:18:08: Dungeon Master: Okay, so you take, that was 11 plus 5, so 16 times 2, 32 on the slashing.
4:18:10: Dungeon Master: And you take only 7 points of necrotic damage.
4:18:15: Dungeon Master: Yeah, I'm doing totally fine.
4:18:34: Speaker_4: I'm glad. No problems. You're still smiling.
4:18:37: Dungeon Master: I'm doing good. I got no problems.
4:18:40: Dungeon Master: At the end of its turn, it'll use two legendary actions and bite you. Me? Yes. No.
4:18:49: Dungeon Master: Natural 20.
4:18:53: Dungeon Master: This is... That does hit.
4:18:53: Dungeon Master: This is nasty. That does hit.
4:18:58: Dungeon Master: I'm going to use... Give me another... Do you have what?  Uh, 19. 19, you pass. You take half damage.
4:19:11: Dungeon Master: It's just still doubled.
4:19:22: Speaker_2: Last one was 32.
4:19:25: Speaker_2: Doubled.
4:19:30: Speaker_4: I think I'll be fine. You're not gonna die, right?
4:19:34: Speaker_4: I got plot armor.
4:19:45: Speaker_4: So that's unfortunate.
4:19:58: Dungeon Master: I am unconscious, yeah, yeah.
4:20:02: Dungeon Master: No. Okay, so yeah. Yeah, your hit points... Oh, it's a six. Oh, opposite, not double. So it's close.
4:20:12: Dungeon Master: That was... Technically, it's 8d6, which would have been doubled, but you passed, so it's just... So I would have been dead. You would have been dead. Just immediately dead.
4:20:22: Speaker_4: Just immediately dead.
4:20:24: Dungeon Master: Yeah. Leopold, you're up.
4:20:44: Speaker_2: I think what I'll do is I'll spin around and hit him with what I got.
4:20:49: Speaker_2: Okay.
4:20:53: Speaker_2: I'm gonna create a cantrip or a bonfire right underneath him. Okay.
4:20:58: Speaker_2: with Create Bonfire.
4:21:01: Speaker_2: Bonfire on the ground. Yeah, 16. It's a silver bonfire, yeah.
4:21:09: Speaker_2: But it's just going to hang.
4:21:22: Speaker_2: must succeed a deck save throw or take 1d8 fire damage must also make a saving throw when it moves into the bonfire for the first time or ends its turn there okay so that's my action for bonus action i will do magic stone and i'll stone
4:21:51: Speaker_2: I'm fucking incredibly frightened right now so that's plus 9 so 21 and magic stone is d6 plus 5
4:22:10: Speaker_2: seven seven damage I don't know where we're gonna run yeah I can't run towards him oh yeah I guess
4:22:32: Speaker_3: Okay, we're six rounds in. What do we got, five?
4:22:38: Dungeon Master: Round nine. Nine, oh my gosh.
4:22:43: Dungeon Master: Nailed everyone.
4:22:43: Dungeon Master: Sorry, you're up. Start of the round. Okay, so let's see. I'm going to roll.
4:22:59: Speaker_3: It's not a one. It's not a one. They've been good to you. It's a die. Dying quickly. Kaladin, your turn.
4:23:46: Speaker_2: Um... Another one is, um...
4:23:50: Dungeon Master: when your DM says 28, and you're like, damn it, and I'm like, to hit.
4:24:00: Speaker_3: Do a melee attack. I can't even get two.
4:24:09: Speaker_3: No, I don't think so.
4:24:13: Speaker_2: Maybe you could like vine whip swing It's huge you could get underneath it.
4:24:20: Speaker_3: I'm gonna go past the bonfire Step over it Although I'd be better to not all three of us die I
4:24:38: Speaker_2: I can't get past it anyway, so I'm fucking toast.
4:24:41: Speaker_3: I can bring you up, but it's just gonna bring us right back down.
4:24:45: Speaker_3: Mm-hmm.
4:24:49: Speaker_3: And I can run under him? Well, I mean, make any dexterity or athletic choices. Oh, it's 30 feet next to Zariel? Yeah, it's 30 feet within Zariel. Now he's 60. Yes, I can.
4:25:02: Speaker_3: I'll do the two blasts, not 21 hits. Double that, maybe.
4:25:08: Speaker_3: 14? 14. And then I'll swing again with light splitter.
4:25:30: Speaker_4: Like five or six.
4:25:31: Speaker_2: Oh man, more than that.
4:25:32: Speaker_4: Yeah.
4:25:33: Speaker_2: Probably at least seven. It's been a while.
4:25:34: Speaker_4: Leveled up two seconds ago.
4:25:37: Speaker_3: I think it was. I just checked the chat. It was. Oh, it's not with the damage. You're down. You're down. You're just done. We're moving forward. We need it inside melee. It's okay. That's a 20, dirty 20 to hit. Hits. Nice. This is the first time you guys broke up 100 damage on it.
4:26:18: Speaker_3: It also starts its turn on the fire, correct?
4:26:18: Dungeon Master: It also starts its turn on the fire, correct?
4:26:20: Dungeon Master: Yep. So it'll make a deck save. 16. That's with advantage.
4:26:23: Speaker_2: Yep.
4:26:27: Dungeon Master: That's a 14. That's a fail. All right.
4:26:30: Speaker_2: Ooh, at least it takes some of that. What's the damage?
4:26:34: Speaker_2: It is a little bit disadvantaged on the next one.
4:26:35: Speaker_3: It is a little bit disadvantaged on the next one.
4:26:41: Dungeon Master: But it'll spin.
4:26:49: Speaker_3: It's two pyramids stuck together.
4:26:53: Speaker_2: Oh, here's the other one.
4:26:58: Speaker_3: Six.
4:27:04: Speaker_4: So yeah, two spits appear, and he just starts rotating.
4:27:08: Dungeon Master: It will not claw you. It can bite or claw on that round, so it'll take its bite on you.
4:27:18: Dungeon Master: After its turn, though, it will claw at you. Misses.
4:27:37: Speaker_2: Back to me. She can't do anything.
4:27:46: Speaker_2: to beat the Wiz saving throw. Yeah, yeah.
4:27:50: Speaker_4: Not really.
4:27:54: Speaker_2: I don't have any more spells. Oh, shit.
4:27:56: Speaker_4: OK. Well, there's that. But even if I could, none of these necessarily would give me advantage.
4:27:57: Speaker_2: But even if I could, none of these necessarily would give me advantage.
4:28:02: Speaker_2: Oh, dear.
4:28:09: Speaker_2: I'm going to have to call pretty soon, too.
4:28:12: Dungeon Master: Might end this mid-battle. Yeah, I got to go.
4:28:15: Speaker_2: I will cast Firebolt, just can't trip.
4:28:20: Speaker_2: Actually, I'll call forth Steel Defender, who won't be frightened, correct?
4:28:28: Speaker_2: Cool.
4:28:29: Speaker_2: And set him forth to attack. How far away can you summon him?
4:28:37: Speaker_2: I think it comes off of me, but 45 feet of movement. My only thought was that you could put him over here and then you'd give him advantage.
4:28:42: Speaker_4: My only thought was that you could put him over here and then you'd give him advantage.
4:28:46: Speaker_2: Oh. Now you can keep it into combat, but that's about it.
4:28:51: Speaker_2: And then I'll use a bonus action to do Magic Stone. Okay. Which is 20 to hit.
4:28:58: Speaker_2: 20 hits. And then 1d6 plus 5.
4:29:08: Speaker_2: ripping it into him and then the uh still defender will be come on uh plus nine to hit i got a good feeling about this yeah that's gonna be a uh 11 all right that was a good feeling but roll for this one
4:29:33: Speaker_2: For what one? Oh, oh, oh. For the Yoda, yeah, yeah. Come on, all the good energy.
4:29:34: Speaker_4: Oh, oh, oh.
4:29:36: Speaker_4: Come on, all the good energy.
4:29:39: Speaker_2: How's a 10? A 10? Normally a 10's fantastic.
4:29:45: Dungeon Master: I've rolled a 17, that's the highest so far. You're in range, starting around Zariel. Before you make your save, you are finding yourself in that weird dream space again, where it's like a memory, but you're not totally sure. You remember  when you first woke up, and you're having a memory of this person reading the things that you can do, and he looks down, and there's, like, elven ears pointing back, and he's got this very high, faint presence of importance, and he goes, needs to be resilient. I need it to be there when I need it. And you have the option
4:29:45: Speaker_2: I've rolled a 17, that's the highest so far. You're in range, starting around Zariel.
4:30:28: Dungeon Master: If you change your form to your true form, you can pop up.
4:30:39: Speaker_3: You're talking like new wear form is what I'm assuming. No, I'm talking back story stuff.
4:31:03: Dungeon Master: Two hours for the body suit he was in.
4:31:07: Speaker_4: Two hours for the body suit he was in.
4:31:13: Speaker_4: Basically, it just looks like, I can't remember the movies because I only watched it like that one time. Ultron. Like the robot in Age of Ultron. Yeah, just like that, but just like bigger. Like I stand up out of my like body suit shell, and then I just kind of get a little bit wider and a little bit bigger, and there's like the spaces just kind of separate out. Like that.
4:31:40: Speaker_4: and uh yeah there's like this like faintish like purplish greenish hue glow that's just emanating from all the cracks and you know stuff emblazoned on his chest is a big z interesting zorro is my real name
4:31:57: Speaker_2: uh so your human skin is gone shedded full metal iron yeah just bald i don't have iron hair you have iron hair no fake hair uh so yeah my what what does that mean for me um give yourself the effects of a short rest so roll some hit dice
4:32:28: Dungeon Master: There we go. It's the magic of foot. When we started the story, and you said you were Warforged, she wanted to change it.
4:32:32: Dungeon Master: I was like, don't just give up on being a Warforged. That's fine. I'll see if I can do this. All right, short rest.
4:32:47: Speaker_2: So I got 43 back on a thing.
4:33:01: Speaker_4: So I'm going to do a... Just gonna check one thing.
4:33:08: Speaker_4: All right, I'm gonna turn into a giant bow constrictor.
4:33:19: Speaker_4: And I'm going to attack with a...
4:33:23: Speaker_4: CONSTRICT attack.
4:33:28: Speaker_2: Is this a metal boa constrictor? That's a 10.
4:33:32: Speaker_4: And a 19. So, 26. It's kind of up to him.
4:33:36: Speaker_2: I see. Do your animals take the... Yeah, yeah.
4:33:39: Speaker_4: Instead of like morphing, I just like... Yeah, I like that.
4:33:50: Speaker_4: Can I have like silver?
4:34:05: Speaker_4: Okay, so that's gonna be 2d8 plus 4. How do I not have a d8?
4:34:14: Speaker_4: Oh, I'm just freaked out. 7, 12, 16, bludgeoning damage.  As I constrict, and then he is grappled.
4:34:39: Speaker_3: Can I do like an object manipulation? Can I wrap the necklace around my sword and then take an attack?
4:34:49: Speaker_4: Me coming back might not be a cue for us to try to kill this thing. It might be a cue for us to leave. I can't run. That's why I constricted it.
4:35:00: Speaker_2: I guess the question is, is this technically moving closer? If I parallel it? I have to close the distance? What if you maintain the same radius?
4:35:12: Speaker_4: And then run around.
4:35:18: Speaker_3: And he had no definitive answer there. Oh, was it? For what? Oh, if you can? No, if he can run in that direction. He can't. He doesn't have space.
4:35:28: Speaker_2: And I can't go underneath. Well, I guess if I went underneath, that would be technically moving away from it.
4:35:35: Speaker_3: It would. You're grappling him. What does that give him? Disadvantage on? There's movement zero until he breaks it.
4:35:39: Dungeon Master: Disadvantage on attacks that are creatures that are not him.  So technically disadvantage on anything but me, so it's not hitting you.
4:35:47: Speaker_4: And then it can't chase after anybody or go anywhere.
4:35:54: Speaker_3: So it doesn't have a reaction. It couldn't take a reactionary.
4:35:57: Speaker_3: Well, it could, but it would be a disadvantage. Yeah.
4:36:09: Dungeon Master: And then we both could run by. That's a good call. Get up there and shove it.
4:36:16: Speaker_3: I'm new in town Like when you say push it like down into the pit you mean Yeah, I was gonna I want to use thunder wave my last level to spell slot, but it still has advantage against that save Don't try it anyway Could we could we do something where I'm like wrapped around its legs?
4:36:40: Speaker_3: Is Thunderwave a save? Thunderwave is a save.
4:36:51: Speaker_3: It's not a tip. Okay.
4:37:27: Dungeon Master: But why though? It's already got it. Because it spells underneath. But if Kaladin takes a stress point.
4:37:37: Speaker_3: Take a stress point, a heartbeat. I want to live! For the greater good. This is Evocation, so can I just blast it out of Zariel's grip?
4:37:48: Dungeon Master: you can choose to push Zariel away by you agree to take in this extra bit of force you feel like that pulse of the core that had sort of like gone into your body and was just sort of resonating in there it sort of channels out of your hands you cast this much bigger spell than you anticipated and it throws Zariel past onto this the steel defender back you get thrown back and this entire walk  topples down to the side as it falls 60 feet. Go ahead and roll double damage. We will take a fifth stress point. 1, 5, and 13 total.
4:38:40: Speaker_3: Oh, that wasn't double though. Did you double that number? No. There you go. Another 14. Okay.
4:39:04: Speaker_3: And I'll use my full movement to not get close enough to the wall to get that opportunity to attack.
4:39:12: Speaker_3: Skirting the edge.
4:39:12: Dungeon Master: Right up to the edge.
4:39:17: Dungeon Master: And then on its turn, it falls 60 feet. It'll take 5d6 damage.
4:39:36: Speaker_2: It just heals everything I hit it for. I was going to say, that's 21 damage. So it really only took one damage. I was going to say, one hit point for the whole battle.
4:39:45: Dungeon Master: But then it heals on its turn. But it is 60 feet down. And the bonfire fell with it, right? Yeah, it's burning the whole thing. It already has the disadvantage because it hasn't taken a strike since then.
4:39:54: Speaker_3: Yeah, it's burning the whole thing. It already has the disadvantage because it hasn't taken a strike since then.
4:40:00: Dungeon Master: This cow's gonna get it.
4:40:03: Speaker_3: Craig's gonna be so confused. What fucking cow?
4:40:16: Dungeon Master: It's a werewolf.
4:40:18: Dungeon Master: It's a hit-sicker. I'm gonna say it'll have to use its full action to get up.
4:40:24: Dungeon Master: Give me a luck check.
4:40:28: Dungeon Master: 11 or higher, it goes after Zariel, not getting close to Leopold. Who wants it? Two. It starts to climb up this wall.
4:40:42: Dungeon Master: But it only has 60 feet normally, so 30 feet. It gets 30 feet up the wall, climbing, scraping, going down a little bit.
4:40:52: Dungeon Master: Leopold, it is your turn.
4:40:54: Speaker_2: So I can't cross over towards Zariel there. All right, jump back into the fog, run all the way over here, and run up this side.
4:40:57: Speaker_4: All right, jump back into the fog, run all the way over here, and run up this side.
4:41:01: Speaker_2: Yeah, that would be cool if I was still a monk. I could probably just casually do that. We've had to kill your character and leave it before we'll do it again.
4:41:22: Dungeon Master: Would Liebl like really want to get past finally?
4:41:26: Speaker_2: I mean, he's terrified. He's terrified of this creature. Surely it's one minute.
4:41:27: Speaker_3: He's terrified of this creature.
4:41:29: Speaker_3: Surely it's one minute. Is it just the whole time?
4:41:33: Speaker_3: Yeah.
4:41:40: Speaker_2: Oh, this frost doesn't create difficult drain or make it slippery.
4:41:44: Speaker_2: It just does cold damage.
4:42:02: Speaker_2: Sure. Yeah. So for my action, I'll do a fireball. Okay. I guess am I just making it pass or am I dispelling the frightened status? Which would you want to do?
4:42:14: Dungeon Master: Which would you want to do? How would you want to approach it?  Would Leopold's mind be thinking like fleeing mentality if I just need to get by or would he be like I need to end this hold on me?
4:42:28: Speaker_2: Yeah, so I think that over the few weeks he's been in the Legionnaire he's evolved to
4:42:36: Speaker_2: Not to be terribly afraid of battles, but still realizes that maybe he's a bit of a coward. So in his brain, he's kind of taking these in and realizing that maybe he needs to get over this.
4:42:52: Speaker_2: He needs to, for the sake of his friends and his companions, break the hold the creature has on him.
4:43:00: Dungeon Master: He'll still take the stress points.  could happen with your armor. But when you make the decision of how you want to end it, you see you have a glow that comes from your chest piece that sends out a wave through your whole suit of armor, and it ends the effect of fear.
4:43:21: Dungeon Master: Do I also take a stress point?
4:43:27: Speaker_3: Okay, so that gives me four stress points, correct? It's four stress points.
4:43:43: Speaker_3: Okay, so then that effect ends So then I don't have disadvantage on the attack which is convenient, so it's a flat roll 18 to hit You might get higher
4:44:09: Speaker_2: 16, yeah, still, that would hit, right?
4:44:09: Speaker_2: And then that's 2d10. Damn, you got a lot of dice over there.
4:44:29: Speaker_2: And disadvantage. But then with a bonus action, I will do a stone.
4:44:39: Speaker_2: 18 to hit?
4:44:41: Dungeon Master: 18 misses.
4:44:41: Speaker_2: Misses.
4:44:43: Speaker_2: And then I will finally, with my fear broken, I have 30 feet of movement, so yeah, I'll move right up here to, that's Kaladin, right?
4:45:00: Dungeon Master: At the start of the round, you are close to the wall. Give me a deck saving throw. All right.
4:45:11: Speaker_4: Uh, 15? 15 makes it.
4:45:13: Speaker_4: I think I already did a bit.
4:45:16: Dungeon Master: Yeah, you can shake it off.
4:45:17: Speaker_2: Although this would be damage.
4:45:18: Dungeon Master: Sorry, you're up at the start of the round. This is no longer a viable pass.
4:45:22: Dungeon Master: So I have to jump. If you can jump 60 feet. No, I meant this way. Yes, you could go that way.
4:45:26: Speaker_4: If you can jump 60 feet.
4:45:32: Speaker_2: That's the way we both have to go. Snakes can't really jump, can they?
4:45:33: Dungeon Master: Snakes can't really jump, can they? No, but they're pretty good at climbing walls and stuff if there's texture.
4:45:39: Dungeon Master: If I was a giant elf, could I carry somebody?
4:45:41: Speaker_4: Yeah.
4:45:46: Speaker_4: I'm going to drop this form as a bonus action. As an action, I'm going to become a giant elf. A giant elf.
4:45:50: Speaker_2: A giant elf. When a giant elf fits through the cave.
4:45:51: Speaker_4: When a giant elf fits through the cave.
4:46:48: Speaker_3: Caladin is your turn.
4:46:50: Speaker_3: I'll use my bonus action to cast the Sophtrack Blast. I'm going to be trying to blast the rock where it's holding.
4:47:00: Speaker_3: Neither of them can. That's why I'm trying to do that. I'll use my action and movement to run as far as I can.
4:47:25: Dungeon Master: It did not take silver damage, did it?
4:47:31: Dungeon Master: No. I think it's only taken silver damage once.
4:47:33: Speaker_2: Oh, did it?
4:47:49: Dungeon Master: And it'll take its two claws at you as you're trying to run by. Is the Steel Defender is within five foot, right?
4:47:54: Speaker_2: Yes. So it will impose disadvantage on that strike.
4:47:57: Dungeon Master: Yes.
4:48:00: Dungeon Master: 18, 18 plus nine, 27.
4:48:07: Dungeon Master: Jesus Christ. You take 10 slashing with, give me a con save.
4:48:22: Speaker_2: Well, and plus 10, right?
4:48:25: Dungeon Master: No.
4:48:26: Speaker_2: Yeah, well.
4:48:26: Dungeon Master: Oh, plus the 10 other damage. Yeah, so I'm down.
4:48:32: Speaker_2: That's rough with disadvantage roll to 18th.
4:48:36: Speaker_2: Your still defender?
4:48:38: Speaker_3: On my attack?
4:48:44: Speaker_2: Okay. This is a disadvantage.
4:48:48: Speaker_2: No, because I think I can only impose disadvantage on attacks against others. That's dirty 20 to hit.
4:48:52: Dungeon Master: That's dirty 20 to hit.
4:48:54: Speaker_2: Yeah, that hits.
4:48:56: Dungeon Master: 8 damage. Is it immune to anything?
4:49:15: Speaker_2: Uh, so that would be 23. Take 7 points of damage instead.
4:49:21: Dungeon Master: Yeah.
4:49:22: Dungeon Master: Start at your turn, give me a death saving throw. Can his Steel Defender interact with him? It can, yes.
4:49:32: Dungeon Master: It's a fail.
4:49:34: Dungeon Master: Your Steel Defender now goes.
4:49:36: Speaker_2: Um, so yeah. Steel Defender is not necessarily within
4:49:43: Speaker_2: Attack of Opportunity reaches.
4:49:46: Dungeon Master: Not until it leaves its space. Right.
4:49:47: Speaker_2: Right. So, Steel Defender will come to my aid and administer one of my healing syringes.
4:49:51: Speaker_2: Okay.
4:49:56: Speaker_2: Which is a regular health potion.
4:50:00: Speaker_2: So, what's that like?
4:50:02: Speaker_3: You just bought a greater. Ah, yeah, yeah.
4:50:04: Speaker_2: Ah, yeah, yeah. So, well, I guess I could just have it administer whatever it is I want it to, right?
4:50:12: Speaker_2: Yep, I'll do that.
4:50:38: Dungeon Master: And then your still defender can attempt to carry you at half speed.
4:50:42: Speaker_2: Oh, okay.
4:50:43: Dungeon Master: But it will take an attack of opportunity.
4:50:46: Speaker_2: The defender, or me. The defender. The defender. Yeah, okay. Let's go ahead and do that.
4:50:48: Dungeon Master: The defender.
4:50:51: Dungeon Master: Yeah, I don't think you would move on if you're involuntarily taken out of combat. It hits, it does 4 plus 5, 9 plus a con saving throw.
4:51:06: Dungeon Master: 10, 18, necrotic, halved, or not halved, depending on the con save.
4:51:13: Speaker_2: Con is plus 5, so 19 on the con save?
4:51:18: Speaker_2: So that's saved, so 9, 9, yeah.
4:51:24: Speaker_2: So what's the total damage?
4:51:27: Speaker_2: 18. Yes, 9 and 9.
4:51:30: Speaker_2: Two little hit points left. That's OK.
4:51:32: Speaker_3: Still alive. As long as it's got one.
4:51:39: Speaker_4: Let's see.
4:51:42: Speaker_2: That's convenient that I didn't have to take that, because I would have been dead. This is the first time we've actually had to flee.
4:51:48: Speaker_3: I didn't think we'd have to do that.
4:51:54: Speaker_2: Yeah, maybe we just need to come back with some silver.
4:51:57: Speaker_3: Just be ready for that component of it. That was so misandry. Even just chill touching it, because that's got a 120-foot radius. I'll do that. Oh, yeah. That's a cantrip.
4:52:06: Speaker_2: Oh, yeah. That's a cantrip.
4:52:10: Speaker_4: I'll do a Healing Word as a bonus action. I'll do a third level. So that's a 3d4 plus 4. I'll do 1 if you do 2. 3d4. I'll do 2d4. 2d4s. I'll roll 1. 2. 2s all the way around. So 6, so 10. You get another 10 healing. Very nice.
4:52:14: Speaker_2: I'll do 1 if you do 2. 3d4. I'll do 2d4. 2d4s. I'll roll 1. 2. 2s all the way around.
4:52:37: Speaker_4: And then I'm just gonna chill by the door as a snake. Okay.
4:52:44: Speaker_3: Okay. Callan, I'll again try to e-suck both miss. Doesn't matter. All of them.
4:52:54: Speaker_3: Get out of there. I haven't rolled over a ten in a hot second.
4:52:58: Speaker_3: To the entrance! You can jump. Give me an athletics check.
4:53:03: Dungeon Master: I'm gonna wriggle my tail out. You can give him assistance. Grab on! Give like a Tarzan sled down a log. Or just a much easier DC.
4:53:06: Speaker_4: You can give him assistance.
4:53:15: Dungeon Master: So yeah, you jump, catch on to the snake body, climb up into the hole.
4:53:23: Speaker_2: Yeah, that would be great if you just miss that. Fell 60 feet.
4:53:33: Speaker_4: No, I'm back up.
4:53:34: Speaker_2: No, I'm back up. Steel Defender 15. I meant you're still down.
4:53:35: Speaker_4: I meant you're still down. Oh.
4:53:38: Speaker_2: Oh. It'll take... Yeah.
4:53:38: Speaker_4: It'll take... Yeah.
4:53:41: Speaker_2: Oh yeah, I guess I have to stand up. It's fight attack on the Steel Defender.
4:53:52: Speaker_2: Steel Defender has the AC of 15. Why did it roll?
4:53:56: Speaker_2: Oh, it missed.
4:53:56: Speaker_2: Oh, okay. Cool.
4:54:24: Speaker_2: I had two hit points.
4:54:26: Dungeon Master: You sort of like dumps you forward into a running position as it like gets destroyed because it only lives to serve you. OK. Your turn. Yeah.
4:54:39: Speaker_2: So I'm going to dash and I'm going to move 60 feet as far as I can get.
4:54:47: Speaker_2: OK.
4:54:49: Dungeon Master: Top of the round is Dario.
4:54:50: Speaker_4: Let's see here. I think I'm going to just run.
4:54:58: Speaker_4: Yeah, I think I'm just going to dash. What's your health looking like?
4:55:02: Speaker_2: 25. It's better than it was.
4:55:05: Speaker_4: I'll give you another third level healing word. So that's 3d4 plus 4, so give me another 2d4. OK. It's a 3. 4, yeah, 8. Bam. Nice. 11, so 15.
4:55:18: Speaker_4: Fifteen.
4:55:18: Speaker_2: Fifteen? Nice. Yeah, that's pretty good.
4:55:21: Speaker_2: That'll give me enough to get past you a few times. So that's the bonus action, and then I'll action and movement forward 60 feet.
4:55:21: Speaker_4: That'll give me enough to get past you a few times.
4:55:23: Speaker_4: So that's the bonus action, and then I'll action and movement forward 60 feet.
4:55:29: Dungeon Master: The thought of you're going to have to bury this hole on your way out or get mauled or just keep hauling acid to get out of here because you'll be followed doesn't resonate, but Callan ends up next.
4:55:45: Speaker_3: I'm gonna do the same thing, I'll try to hit it with two of the blasts.
4:55:52: Dungeon Master: And you're aiming for sort of where its feet are at the stone. The ledge. It's still right at the ledge, correct.
4:56:01: Speaker_3: It's eight. Yes. Eleven. Yeah.
4:56:05: Dungeon Master: Fifteen. We'll say it drops a little bit. It'll have to use movement to get like on top of it and it probably won't reach him. Okay. And then do you leave? I'll move twenty, thirty feet down the tunnel, yeah. Back. It's turn heals again. It is.
4:56:25: Dungeon Master: Back to full health.
4:56:26: Dungeon Master: So it's within attack of opportunity? Okay. I'm gonna try and run up here, but can I take my time and maybe try and sidestep this and not necessarily try a big rogue jump?
4:56:54: Dungeon Master: Yeah, you've got more than enough movement to even at half speed to get in the hole.
4:56:57: Speaker_2: So that way I don't have to roll to miss that ledge.
4:57:01: Dungeon Master: You get in. I'm going to use my action to dash, so I'm just going to... Dash?
4:57:03: Speaker_2: Yeah.
4:57:06: Dungeon Master: Yeah.
4:57:07: Dungeon Master: You guys want to try to blow up the hole or something?
4:57:08: Speaker_4: Yeah, I was thinking once I can see that they're both inside, I want to try to do a thing where I rotate my body and lift and create a space for them to pass me.
4:57:18: Speaker_4: And I want to just really, really stretch out the opening.  and then just like drop and move forward and try to get it to collapse yeah so i don't have to be like a constrict attack or what is like your highest thing your highest role do you think my highest role what does that mean what's your best modifier oh uh it's gonna be wisdom it's gonna be uh
4:57:45: Speaker_4: yeah my wisdom is uh 18 so it'd be a plus four okay so go ahead and make it like um a wisdom based attack so plus seven to the d20 roll okay 17 yes so that succeeds all right so i'll be stopped up ahead stands your body out drops in moves forward great thing about being a serpent is you can't dig so like even as the dirt's like falling on you you're still moving
4:58:00: Dungeon Master: and we'll stop it right there. As you guys are now on the run.
4:58:21: Speaker_3: That was ill-prepared. Love it when a plan comes together. Immensely ill-prepared.
4:58:24: Dungeon Master: Immensely ill-prepared. You guys just went right in.
4:58:35: Speaker_4: And we went, we'll just, we'll take your necklace.
4:59:03: Dungeon Master: Riku will be where his absence still makes sense.
4:59:16: Dungeon Master: Oh dear, we should have brought some silver with us.

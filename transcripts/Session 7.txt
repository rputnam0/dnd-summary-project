Dungeon Master 00:00:00 Okay, I'll just read it then and I'll add some stuff that it just like didn't quite get right, but like it's fantastic. Okay, let me just read it off then. The bustling city of New New Harbor hummed with activity as night fell over the market district.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:01 Oh, yeah. Before I forget. Dude, it's really good. It's fucking really good. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:00:01 Well. I didn't check the AI. I would need to log into our music. Let's see.
Zariel Torgan 00:00:03 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 00:00:26 Three newly minted members of the Stonewall Legionnaires, Zariel, the nature-attuned druid, Leopold, the mysterious war-forged artificer, and Kaladin, the spell-slinging wizard, made their way through the crowded streets. Their mission? To investigate a shadowy cult known as the Hand of God. The trio's journey had led them to the Spit and Swallow, a seedy tavern nestled in the industrial area near the loading docks, as they approached the sounds of
Dungeon Master 00:00:57 Raucous laughter and clinking glasses spilled out into the street. Pushing through the swinging doors, they entered a dimly lit room, thick with pipe smoke and the smell of stale ale. I don't know that I said that, but I like the touch. The tavern's interior was a testament to its rough clientele. Chips and gashes marred the wooden walls, while torn posters hung haphazardly. In the center of the room, a large sand-filled fighting pit drew the attention of the patrons.
Zariel Torgan 00:01:11 Hm hm hm
Leopold Magnus 00:01:12 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:01:27 At the moment, two commoners were engaged in a bare-knuckled brawl as the crowd cheered and placed bets. As the adventurer scanned the room, Leopold's gaze fell upon a muscular man leaning against the wall. He was actually sitting. The Warforged keen eye spotted a peculiar detail. Hanging from the man's side was a waist rosary with the iron symbol depicting a right hand, its fingers slightly curled forward. This matched the description of the hand of God's emblem.
Dungeon Master 00:01:56 also correction there was no uh description before he just sort of decided that it was good on an intuition check he was also very obvious in the crowd we'll say if we remember he was sort of just really standing out which is where the part of the dilemma was you had been made pretty quickly
Leopold Magnus 00:02:05 Got it. Also not true, I think. Yeah, I think I was pretty noisy.
Dungeon Master 00:02:20 Fellas, Leopold whispered, his mechanical voice barely audible over the din. I think we might have to ask the gentleman some questions. Caledon nodded. It's taken some liberties, but again, it's good. Caledon nodded, his eyes narrowing as he assessed the situation. Keep them at your side, he cautioned. Also didn't happen. Did you?
Zariel Torgan 00:02:27 Yeah, just shouted and pointed. Yeah, he yelled and pointed.
Kaladin Shash 00:02:28 You did what you know you at you. He he too. I totally said that he's being so I was like cutting out man. He was pointing over the crowd. I said all these things. Yeah, this is great. I was like.
Leopold Magnus 00:02:45 Yeah, I think I was pointing, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:02:49 As the group deliberated on their approach, they learned that the man they sought out was known as Cedric, a renowned fighter and champion of the arena. However, gaining an audience with him proved challenging. The tavern operated on a strict hierarchy. Only those who proved themselves in combat could challenge Cedric directly. With few options available, the adventurers hatched a plan. Leopold, despite his reservations, volunteered to enter the fighting pits.
Dungeon Master 00:03:15 "'Oh dear, oh dear,' he muttered, his metallic frame creaking as he made his way into the Arrhenius edge. "'I don't know if I'm cut out for this adventuring business.' Absolutely said that. That's verbatim." "'The bookie?' "'Yeah, it's good. So good. When I first read it, it was like ten minutes after you said that. I was blown away.' "'The bookie, a numbish figure with pointy features, took Leopold's name, or rather, his hastily concocted Elias Grandpa bot.
Leopold Magnus 00:03:26 Isn't that crazy? Yeah, it's insane.
Dungeon Master 00:03:43 and entered him into the fight roster. Also, a little bit differently is, you guys had all suggested he do it because of his IAC. It wasn't like a, oh, I guess I'll do it. Yeah. As Leopold prepared for combat in Sauriel and Kaladin, placed bets on their companion, hoping to maximize their potential winnings.
Kaladin Shash 00:03:58 Really threw him into it.
Zariel Torgan 00:03:59 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:04:00 Yeah, I had no choice in the matter.
Dungeon Master 00:04:10 The crowd's attention turned into the pit as Leopold's opponent was announced, a skilled fighter known as Allara the Serpent. The war-forged artificer put on an exaggerated show of creakiness and fragility, playing his grandpa-bot persona to lower expectations. As the fight began, Leopold's true capabilities shown through his high armor class and magical abilities kept him one step ahead of Allara's attacks. Paired with the magic that was cast on him by his companions,
Dungeon Master 00:04:38 Remember that, you know? The crowd watched in amazement as the seemingly decrepit automaton dodged an counterattack with surprising agility. The battle was fierce, with both combatants landing solid blows. Leopold utilized his magic stones and crossbow to great effect, while Allara demonstrated her prowess with a blade and fist. In a climactic moment, Leopold managed to knock Allara prone with a well-placed grease spell, turning the tide of the fight. It was pretty sick.
Kaladin Shash 00:04:40 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:05:07 Yada yada, I'm going to get a little bit more vague to speed it up. You guys are keeping a track on Cedric through the whole fight, seeing that he cast spells to sort of help and hinder, depending on how the fight was going. Seems just like fun. As Leah pulled vast in his unexpected triumph, Azariel stepped forward to take on the next challenger, because you guys had realized that each of you would have to fight to get a fight to chance with him.
Dungeon Master 00:05:34 Zariel adopted the moniker Tuberculosis Jim and faced off against a formidable opponent known as Ruik the Iron Fist. Zariel's strategy differed from Leopold's, relying on his ability to wildshape into a direwolf. The transformation caught both the crowd and his opponent off guard. The battle that ensued was brutal and closely matched, with both Zariel and Ruik creating devastating blows.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:40 It's
Dungeon Master 00:05:58 Throughout the fight, Zariel demonstrated incredible resilience, repeatedly pushing himself to the brink of unconsciousness only to rally and continue the assault. The druid's tenacity was matched only by Ruik's relentless attacks and stunning strikes.
Dungeon Master 00:06:11 As the battle reached its climax, both combatants were battered and exhausted. In a final, desperate move, Zariel summoned a thorny whip from the ground, lashing out at Rurik and bringing the fight to a dramatic conclusion. The crowd that had been holding its collective breath exploded into cheers at the unexpected outcome. I mean, how gorgeous is that? That's... hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:06:32 That's wild. Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:06:32 It was well described. It was just like that, down and over and over.
Zariel Torgan 00:06:33 That's fantastic.
Dungeon Master 00:06:37 With two victories under their belt, it fell to Kaladin to complete the trio's challenge. The wizard faced off against a hulking fighter known simply as the boulder. Unlike his companions, Kaladin relied on his arcane prowess to gain the upper hand. The battle began with Kaladin attempting to unleash a powerful fireball from a scroll he possessed. However, his lack of familiarity with the higher level spell caused it to fizzle, leaving him vulnerable to the boulder's attacks.
Dungeon Master 00:07:03 Undeterred, Kaladin adopted his strategy, using a combination of defensive spells and precise strikes with his magical spear. As the fight progressed, Kaladin demonstrated his tactical acumen, using spells like Mirror Image to confuse his opponent and to shield the deflecting incoming attacks. The boulder proved to be a formidable foe, his powerful blows
Dungeon Master 00:07:26 threatening to overwhelm the wizard at several points. In a pivotal moment, Kaladin managed to catch the boulder off guard with a sleep spell, causing the hulking fighter to collapse mid-attack. Seizing the opportunity, Kaladin delivered a final, decisive blow, securing victory for himself and completing the group's challenge. With all three adventurers emerging victorious from their respective battles, the atmosphere
Dungeon Master 00:07:52 in the spit and swallow reached a fever pitch. The crowd, initially skeptical of the newcomers, never guarded them with a mix of awe and respect. Didn't say that. As the dust settled and the adrenaline began to fade, Geo's attention returned to the original goal, confronting Cedric. Blah, blah, blah. Cedric addressed the adventurers directly. Well, that was pretty interesting, actually.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:03 Heh heh heh.
Dungeon Master 00:08:19 He said, his voice carrying easily over the din of the tower. Mind if I jump in? That was verbatim. The implications of the challenge hung heavy in the air. Adventures battered and depleted, and from their recent fights exchanged weary glances. They had come seeking information, but now found themselves on the verge of facing an opponent of unknown but clearly formidable capabilities. As Cedric dropped into the sandy arena, the ground itself seemed to tremble beneath his feet.
Dungeon Master 00:08:49 He flexed, and a wave of energy pulsed through the room, causing the adventurer's adrenaline to surge anew. In that moment, they felt a rush of power force through their bodies, granting them the benefits of a long rest and elevating them to the fourth level of experience. And then it did this weird summarization.
Leopold Magnus 00:09:08 Yeah, it's a little off in some weird areas. I'm working on that. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That that bit. Excellent. The rest of it, I think it's trying to do like an NPC recap that just isn't quite there. I don't know what's going on. Maybe I gave it too many words.
Dungeon Master 00:09:12 I'm not, I'm not going to do that whole next part because that's where it ended right there. I just love it. Just like it decided to summarize it in a really nice way.
Leopold Magnus 00:09:33 to like, I said, output 3000 words and it was done at that point. And then it was just like, man, I'm going to keep going. Cause I got to hit 3000. I don't know. Yeah. I, uh, I gotta, I gotta play around with it a little bit more. Um, but yeah, each prompt is like, when I run that, I basically put back all of our old transcripts. So all of our old sessions were there for context. So it has the entire context of the campaign to date. And I think that helps a lot too.
Dungeon Master 00:09:41 Gosh, yeah, maybe. That's a pretty good thought, actually.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:06 so it just heard itself give a recap basically and then it it heard you fix is it gonna fix
Dungeon Master 00:10:13 Oh, right. What if it, Oh no, I mean, it'll, it'll probably do this whole section as like they summarize the previous encounter and then it'll talk about us discussing things and this gives it more context.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:18 I mean, potentially, right? So I, cause when I, yeah, I mean, I include in the prompt, like ignore discussions that are relevant to the, like to D and E. So that way, when it, like, you know, in the earlier parts of the game, it's like, we talk about Craig or whatever, it just cuts it all out.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:48 Oh, gotcha. That was fantastic.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:48 It doesn't even acknowledge. I mean, like, I, I, I guess it's in there, but because I prompted it and said, don't pay attention to any of that. It, it knows, you know, it can decipher what's relevant to D and D and what's not. But yeah. Yeah. I mean, it is almost exactly word for word and in some cases verbatim what happened and it has a lot of like. Literative prose. It's doing a very good job.
Kaladin Shash 00:11:00 That is just crazy how well that did.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:17 Yeah, I think that was the thing that impressed me the most was the variability of the adjectives and the literary devices that it used to describe stuff weren't just consistently the same. That was pretty cool. Damn.
Leopold Magnus 00:11:30 Yeah. Yeah, part of the prompt includes like how the pros should go like you are a legendary dungeon master. You have to like set the scene like the prompting is really the critical part. But yeah, nonetheless, it's been pretty interesting to figure that out.
Kaladin Shash 00:11:30 Yeah. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:51 Yeah, it's pretty sweet. So Jonathan, it said you paused the game. How does that work? Oh shit, OK.
Dungeon Master 00:11:56 Mm-hmm. I'm not going to tell you. I can just pause what you guys see if I need to do something real quick. Yeah, I can do a lot for you guys. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:12:02 Hey, quick question. I know. I know we bet on the first two fights. Did we get we get the payout for Zario?
Leopold Magnus 00:12:09 Oh, that's an interesting feature. That's like part of VTT. I think I did. Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:12:24 Yeah, I've heard it. I told you guys in the moment. I don't remember who bet what, but one of you won $255, the other one $300. And that was on that second fight. And the first fight, you guys won $448 and $248, respectively, on whoever did those.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:27 Yeah. Yeah, I got 248 because I didn't bet on the second one or the third one.
Kaladin Shash 00:12:32 Okay, okay, that's. I've got, yeah, I've got 500. Okay, I've got it. I've got it. Got it. Okay, great. Did we take a stress point?
Leopold Magnus 00:12:42 Yeah, I've got 300 gold in my inventory, so I'm assuming we've got that sorted out. I think Jesse may have. I don't, I didn't.
Dungeon Master 00:13:00 All of you? No, that's sort of doing like behind the screen, like video game mechanic moments where, yeah, leveled up based off of the circumstance, not the time of day. You know, sometimes that doesn't make sense.
Kaladin Shash 00:13:05 No, I'm just asking, just in moving up to the fourth level, that wasn't like a stress point scenario, right? Long rest. OK. Let's find out. Scroll. Level up. Restore health. Love it. Love it. Cool. That's sweet. I love that.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:28 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:13:37 Okay, unless you guys wanna do anything in this moment, again, the scene is very tense. All of the people shoulder to shoulder in this entire tavern, again, that are just not shown, are holding their breath in this moment as Cedric has jumped down into the pit. Just this muscular, stoic,
Dungeon Master 00:14:04 stone face brawler type. He's got the picture that it sends, has it with like golden fists, but he's just got his fists wrapped with just like, you know, straps of fabric, strips of fabric, not quite like ace bandage, but like that kind of deal. They're not leather gauntlets. They're not padded or they're not spike knuckles or anything like that. They're just wraps.
Dungeon Master 00:14:35 You guys are still kind of scattered in this moment, so we all pick up right here with you guys. Seeing that, what do you guys want to do?
Zariel Torgan 00:14:47 I'll make my way down into the pit to stand beside Kaladin.
Kaladin Shash 00:14:57 Yeah, can I, can I, I'm gonna go ahead and just cast mirror image as well.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:15 I'm thinking, yeah, I think I'll probably just walk up and join the crew, maybe kind of standing just over Daryl's shoulder here.
Dungeon Master 00:15:31 And when you get into the pit, do you go straight line through it or do you go around and down the stairs? He nods to each of you respectively in a row.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:38 Yeah, I'm standing on the edge of the pit here by this bench and my legs just actually and I kind of stiff bodied jump kind of like some of the Boston dynamic robots you might see down in here and just kind of land next to them.
Kaladin Shash 00:15:52 I would imagine the same rules apply, right? To unconsciousness, do you fight for more?
Zariel Torgan 00:15:52 Awesome Oh
Dungeon Master 00:16:02 It goes, fellas, what's the stakes and what are the rules? If you're looking to up the ante, higher the stakes, we can keep going.
Dungeon Master 00:16:31 But if this is just a fight for show, unconsciousness will do. Questions about what? You guys aren't just here for the title? Let me get this straight then. You all win.
Kaladin Shash 00:16:40 Yes, when we beat you, I'll answer our questions. Whatever, whatever I want to talk to you about. Yes, we'll take your money as well, and all your pride. What else do you want?
Dungeon Master 00:17:01 and I answer questions about whatever you want. Money, then I like that talk. I reckon we wager 300 a piece. Give me a persuasion check. You try to hide it.
Kaladin Shash 00:17:14 Let's make it four. Yeah. I was not convincing. They're all three. They're all five.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:22 I'm gonna give him guidance. Oh, maybe not. Maybe I'll just say, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:29 Let's see. Hold on, so. So I'm going to cast friends on him. The last up to a minute. So I believe will be long enough for us to get fighting.
Dungeon Master 00:17:43 500. What are the components for friend?
Kaladin Shash 00:17:45 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:18:07 A small amount of makeup applied to the face. SM.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:10 No, he means like verbal somatic. I don't have it. Yeah, no. Material.
Kaladin Shash 00:18:16 You'll see little letters. Yep, verbal materials. You need a small bit of makeup, and you have to say something, or you have to make a motion with the motion. He knows.
Dungeon Master 00:18:20 it's somatic and material so um you like yeah you like you say something in a weird way you put makeup on your face so you have the option of hiding it you can try to not be obvious about it otherwise he might if he knows how spells work you guys don't really know you've seen some stuff but the extent isn't clear um
Leopold Magnus 00:18:37 Right. I mean, so I guess like if he notices, does the spell still take an effect though?
Dungeon Master 00:18:47 If he knows what spell casting is he's going to realize you're doing something Since you didn't do it like, uh behind his back or anything like that Yeah
Zariel Torgan 00:19:08 I don't know I mean
Leopold Magnus 00:19:09 Cause like it says for the duration you have advantages on all Charisma Tricks directed at one creature. Oh, oh, I have an advantage. I can't give somebody else. Nevermind. Sorry. Right.
Kaladin Shash 00:19:21 Yeah, it's OK. The role wouldn't have mattered one bit.
Dungeon Master 00:19:21 Yeah. He sees you as, like, a really good friend for the duration, and as soon as it ends, he would act accordingly. Like, the spell describes it being, like, either very hostile or, like, just fine with it. Yeah, so you can absolutely, if you'd like to...
Leopold Magnus 00:19:38 Right. But you know, we're going to be squaring off in this pit anyhow. So like, what's the matter? But yeah, I'll go ahead and hold it. I thought I could give Kaladin benefit, but it doesn't work that way.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:57 So are we fighting all three against one? Or what are we doing? What? You say you don't have any friends?
Dungeon Master 00:20:05 Why do you need some friends? I said, why do you need some more friends?
Zariel Torgan 00:20:17 Oh, uh, no, uh, Leo and Kaladin are my only friends. Uh, I was just wondering if, if it was gonna be us against you, or if you were gonna, like, need help, or... I imagine you two would normally fight one-on-one, so, I don't know. Oh, shit. Alright.
Dungeon Master 00:20:40 I think I'll manage. I appreciate your concern though. Cool.
Zariel Torgan 00:20:45 Well then, I'm gonna scratch the ground and let out like a roar, but it's still in my voice, so it's like a roar. And then I'm gonna turn into a polar bear. I'm just gonna roar. My feet on the ground.
Kaladin Shash 00:20:47 That's fine.
Dungeon Master 00:21:16 Let me see if I got the polar bear. You guys have a, you have a moment, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:21:24 Do you want us to roll for initiative or can I take an action? I guess I've already cast. I've already done an act. I've already taken an action right now. I cast mirror image already. It's going to be 500. He made it 500.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:28 Actually, yeah. Go ahead.
Leopold Magnus 00:21:42 Oh, okay. So hold on. Did we decide we're going to bet for 400? Did we go through that yet? Oh, 500 each. I don't, I mean, you guys are going to have spot me some gold. I only have 342. Oh, okay. Got it. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:21:50 Maybe five. No, it's 500 a person.
Kaladin Shash 00:21:51 I was like, great. I said, great, let's go. I only have 500. I have only 500. I think you meant per party. Guys, we're just winning. Don't worry. We're winning. Just run out.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:58 Oh, I thought it was per party. We better win then. Does he have a sword or anything that he's holding?
Leopold Magnus 00:22:12 We're going to have a hard time paying up if we lose. Better pull all the tricks out on this one.
Dungeon Master 00:22:27 Just two fists. Just wraps on his hand. No.
Kaladin Shash 00:22:27 Just knuckles. Yeah. It's gonna see some stunning coming to our future. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:29 Any bracers or anything? Anything made of metal? All right.
Leopold Magnus 00:22:45 Uh, oh, I guess I do have a. Nice. Takes an action to equip an item, right? Can I uh?
Dungeon Master 00:23:00 Yes.
Leopold Magnus 00:23:22 Or I guess, can my crossbow be in one hand and a mace in another? Or I'm holding a shield, so I have to, I can only, yeah, so I can only equip one item.
Dungeon Master 00:23:29 Yeah, if you have a shield, you have to have that shield. I'm going to say one action. Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:38 Could I have cast a spell before I do my wild shape? Damn it! Okay, that's fair. All right, I'm ready to rock. Are we rolling initiative? All right. What size is he? I missed, I missed, what, what?
Kaladin Shash 00:23:44 Medium.
Dungeon Master 00:23:59 The creature, I think, technically. Medium. I think he's medium. Medium humanoid. That's just kind of, I gotta be so mean to him.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:06 There's a medium. OK. All right. Wait. Well, we're going to be beating him humanoid. Don't think about it. Or about it.
Dungeon Master 00:24:28 Uh, already leopold, I need you on initiative and then And then we're ready to rock Nice but not good enough with a 19 cedric will act first Let's see, what does he want to do? Uh
Leopold Magnus 00:24:32 Yeah. Nice.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:38 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 00:25:00 actually have out since well since it starts on his turn we'll do this uh i had mentioned before you guys have felt an immense pressure sort of set in everybody who is within 30 feet of him as he moves in go ahead and give me a wisdom saving throw
Kaladin Shash 00:25:16 It's everybody. 15 Yes.
Leopold Magnus 00:25:22 Oh, not super wise of me.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:27 15.
Dungeon Master 00:25:30 15 or 15 needed. Two passes, one fail. Leopold, uh, you are afraid of Cedric. So, uh, you are under the feared condition for the time being and you can, um, until the end of your next turn, actually. So it's not that long, but for the time being, you can't willingly move towards him in any attacks. I don't have disadvantage while you can see him.
Leopold Magnus 00:25:58 Be right.
Dungeon Master 00:26:03 Now he's going to come in. Pretty obvious the polar bear is going to be the biggest threat. And then he will just make his attacks. So what is your AC as a polar bear?
Kaladin Shash 00:26:18 you.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:25 12. Really low. Oh yeah. Yep. Hey, you don't kick a bear. I'm like a puppy.
Dungeon Master 00:26:33 Dirty 20 to hit. And 18 to hit. And then he will kick you. He kicks the bear. 16 to hit. So three hits on three attacks.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:57 Ugh. Oh yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:27:03 You take, and I'm just going to roll this. I'll do it on it. I'll let you guys see it. It is 6 plus 1 here at 7 plus, Jesus, man, plus 6. So we're at 13.
Dungeon Master 00:27:31 Then we're at, that's a four, so that's 17. And then the kick is the heavy one, but I only rolled a two, so that's seven more damage plus two. Okay. I think that makes that like 30, no, like 21 or something like that. 31? 26, okay. 26 points of damage.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:54 I was at 26th. Ooh.
Dungeon Master 00:28:00 as he hits you three times really hard and you guys since the polar bear is the first target uh actually both of you are behind it give me a perception check to see who sort of sees
Kaladin Shash 00:28:13 You can't be recognized.
Dungeon Master 00:28:15 this, the fighting deal, but the polar bear for sure sees it. So Zaro, you see as he attacks, he hits with just this normal fist and then you feel like a half second delay and you get a like a sudden jab of like,
Dungeon Master 00:28:32 What only field can be described as light energy, like radiant damage follows his attack. So it's like hit, hit, kick, and you feel a delay of like, boom, boom, boom, after those three hits. And you take a delayed response as that happens. And then he will circle back.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:49 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:29:00 to just try to make it difficult to get behind him. Next up will be Leopold. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:10 Um, okay. So. See the steel defender. Is it just a regular action, right? To call forth. Okay. Yep. Um, so I'll use my action to, uh, put a steel defender down behind him. So, uh, once again, the animated suit kind of emerges from my own, some of the components of my armor forming its body.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:37 And I kind of crouch down and stand up at the same time right as it jumps off my shoulders and lands behind Cedric. So that's my. Yeah, like right right there. Cool.
Kaladin Shash 00:29:47 It's cool.
Dungeon Master 00:29:49 Behind, like, here or behind here? Cool. I'm going to throw in this dead body as your steel defender.
Zariel Torgan 00:30:02 Uh, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:04 And then I'm gonna yell out, defend me! And with a bonus action, because I am very afraid, I think my suit will automatically whirl up in my defense and stones will kind of start to emerge out of the cracks in my armor and rotate around me. And I will cast magic stone to get those activated.
Dungeon Master 00:30:34 Nice. At the end of your turn, yeah, at the end of your turn, he is going to use a legendary action. He's going to do one more strike on the polar bear. Oh, that misses an 11.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:37 And that's my turn.
Zariel Torgan 00:30:47 I put up my paw. All right, you mess with the bear, you get the paws.
Kaladin Shash 00:30:53 All right, all right, plus seven to hit. My goodness. Very dexterous. Teeth pause.
Dungeon Master 00:31:05 Nice. Azariel, you're up next. Tongue? The bear is telling me.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:20 That was a delay joke. All right. I'm going to move. Let's see. I'd like to flank with the steel defender, since he's helping my ally. Does he count as a guy for me? Am I able to move to this corner over here?
Leopold Magnus 00:31:22 But all we hear is grrrrr.
Kaladin Shash 00:31:25 Yeah, exactly right. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:31:42 Yeah. Yes, you can.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:52 Alright. I'm gonna... do a very cute, like, bunny hop. Doo-doof! Landing on my front two feet. Spin 90 degrees. And I'm gonna reach out with, uh... a claw first. With advantage. Take a big bear swa-rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Dungeon Master 00:32:15 25 hits. 17 does not hit.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:21 Come on. Go away. There we go. All right, and then after that... Oh, damn it. I meant to do that at advantage. Let me try that again. The first... Okay, yeah, so 17 hit. Oh, rough. Rough. All right, well, the claw attack hits. Ooh, nice.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:49 17 points of damage as a bear paw just swipes across his chest. Let's see... I don't think I have anything else as a bear. Maybe I'll... I'll point towards his, like...
Dungeon Master 00:32:58 Alrighty, alrighty, anything else on your turn?
Zariel Torgan 00:33:19 Maybe what I'll do is I'll shadow box to try to get across the point that like, I'm gonna go like a jab jab cross, and then like give it a second, and then go like, and then make like a mime that I'm getting punched, to see if they can get what's going on. I don't know, that might be a lot.
Dungeon Master 00:33:45 That's a lot. You're a polar bear. You could give me a performance like with disadvantage. The bear stands up and looks like pawing at him, and then it shakes a bit. Baffling behavior from Zario, who's usually so coherent as an animal.
Kaladin Shash 00:33:45 Yeah, great job, great job. I was gonna say, I don't, oops.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:48 Can I make a check to see if I get any of that across? It's already minus one. That's gonna be an eight. I'm just like having an aneurysm.
Leopold Magnus 00:33:48 Go get him, Zario! Zario, are you doing quite all right over there?
Kaladin Shash 00:34:15 Great. Miss come on.
Dungeon Master 00:34:16 Shortly after following up, it is... It's Kaladin. What is, um... Oh, at the end of your turn, actually, he's going to take one more attack at you as another legendary action. It was a 16 to hit.
Zariel Torgan 00:34:26 Mmm. Oh yeah. Oof.
Dungeon Master 00:34:42 And you take 13 Bludgeoning and 2 Radiant. That was an 8 on that damage die. That was good. How's the Polybear looking? Bear looks rough. Okay, Kaladin, your turn.
Kaladin Shash 00:34:53 Yeah, maxed it, maxed it. Dude, smoked him in his first go.
Zariel Torgan 00:34:58 All right. I can't tell you, but I have one hit point. Looks fucked up.
Leopold Magnus 00:35:18 Hey, Caledon, I think he took one to the head there. He's not looking very good.
Kaladin Shash 00:35:29 I think all from where I'm at right now, I'm going to go ahead and just cast bless. It'll get all of us in it. Robin might still be able to use a cantrip or that be considered two spells.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:38 Nice. Yeah, if it's a bonus action cantrip.
Dungeon Master 00:35:54 If it has the right action economy. Yeah. Usually. Yeah, and one's gotta be a cantrip too. Yes.
Kaladin Shash 00:35:59 Has to be a bonus section. Yeah, let me, I can't remember the bonus section. Can't remember what I was thinking. No, so I think that the cantrip is, yeah, that's the catch. That's the catch. Yes. That's correct.
Leopold Magnus 00:36:06 Then you can do two spells if one's a bonus action and one is a main action Yeah, yeah All right, so I could do like a spell then do magic stone Okay, I didn't know that I thought you just couldn't do two spells matter what cool That's chill, I'm not complaining
Zariel Torgan 00:36:07 Oh yeah, and not a minor bonus action either.
Dungeon Master 00:36:26 Some people play it that way, but that feels hard on casters who are so squishy.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:37 squishy caster from the robot.
Kaladin Shash 00:36:37 All right, having cast Bless, I think I'll just expand my quarterstaff into the spear again, and I'll just level it towards him, and I'll just keep standing where I'm at. Let's see, am I around there?
Dungeon Master 00:36:56 Okay, at the top of the round, back to Cedric. He will, as a bonus action, use something he couldn't before. He's gonna use his Calculated Loss ability. Because he took damage on the previous round, he can move without provoking Opportunity Attack and close the range down onto one person. He's gonna put himself right in the mix of it.
Dungeon Master 00:37:28 And his target for this is going to be Leopold, because Leopold is now going to have disadvantage on all melee attacks, melee weapon attacks against him, and disadvantage on all dexterity and constitution saves for this turn. But instead of attacking him first, he's going to do a side jab and hit the polar bear right in the face for his first attack.
Kaladin Shash 00:37:52 I'm going to miss. Is 12 the AC? Yeah, no, not for that.
Zariel Torgan 00:37:52 Somebody call PETA. It is. Bless. I'm just kidding. It doesn't do anything. Damn it. All right. Yeah, I'm back to my form and I've lost some hit points.
Dungeon Master 00:37:58 It might miss, 12 exactly. Yes, it is. You take 10 damage total.
Zariel Torgan 00:38:26 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:38:26 Oh, also, because you did damage to them, he can do something else on his attack. Learn from your mistakes as an ability. When he's hit with a melee attack, he can use his reaction to study your opponent's fighting style on their next turn. I can do one of the following features against you. I am going to do out of breath. When I made my jab attack,
Dungeon Master 00:38:55 Uh, it was to force the air to your lungs. I need a DC-13 con save. Yes. No. Yep. You got this. Come on.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:02 I am a different creature. Does that matter? Okay. Alright. And then I get to add a d4. So it's a 13.
Kaladin Shash 00:39:09 Well, you took damage, that's the rule. Yes. Yes, yes.
Dungeon Master 00:39:23 Nice. Okay. You do not feel out of breath in this moment. And then he is, uh, which is good. He will then take his, uh, continuous turn. He only intended to hit you once. So once that form goes, you pop up for a second. He's going to focus in on Leopold. He's got one more jab.
Leopold Magnus 00:39:47 Uh, what if he taken? Oh, he doesn't take attacks of opportunity said. Got it. OK, so when would the defender goes at after like before my turn?
Dungeon Master 00:39:53 Not with that ability. Only a 10 to hit, which misses. And then he's going to do his kick on you. 13, it misses. Those are bad rolls. Leopold, you are up. If it doesn't, in the description, say that it gets its own initiative, it just acts on your turn.
Leopold Magnus 00:40:21 shares my initiative. Okay. Uh, but takes its turn immediately after mine. Okay. Uh, so do we have flanking on him or is it because he's basically level with us? Then there's no way flanking. Got it. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:40:31 Okay. You are not flanking with anybody, but Zariel and Kaladin are flanking.
Kaladin Shash 00:40:35 Does that mean that little thing? Does that mean that little guardian would have had a chance to attack on his turn? Right, last round? Right? Yeah, no, it's initiative immediately after. Immediately after.
Leopold Magnus 00:40:56 Oh, yeah, because I called it. No, because it would act. Yeah. Yeah, good looking out, so I called it in and then it would be immediately after my turn, it would have had a chance to swing at him. Yeah, because he was he was flanking. OK, so then how on earth do I?
Zariel Torgan 00:40:57 Can it attack when he calls it, or does it have to wait?
Dungeon Master 00:41:03 It's because it takes us a journey to be after.
Kaladin Shash 00:41:05 Yeah. Yeah. With advantage. Point.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:27 Okay, so Force Empowered Rend is my attack. It's my spell attack modifier to hit. Okay, so then... So my spell attack to hit, that would then be plus six, like as if I was just casting a spell.
Dungeon Master 00:41:56 Well, no, your modifier is. Uh. I think that's with proficiency, so it might just be like four or something. On the top of your spell page, it says modifier. Modifiers plus 4.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:57 Okay. Okay, so.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:20 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:42:26 Plus four where where do you see that? I guess just for my benefit Okay, ah Okay, so this My spell attack modifier to hit okay, so plus six. Yeah cool Sorry, I'm gonna play the caster. Oh shit
Dungeon Master 00:42:31 On the spells page you have the top plus 4 modifier plus 6 spell attack 14 safety C. Perfect. That's new. 32 to hit damn.
Leopold Magnus 00:42:54 No, that's 2, I did not want to roll 2. I don't think he hits. That would be a 7 on that first one. But on Leopold's turn...
Kaladin Shash 00:43:00 Oh. Oh. It's the T-Star Crypt Seal.
Dungeon Master 00:43:05 That's okay. And you were no longer afraid. That was only for that round. His calculated loss. So you have disadvantage on melee attacks against him.
Leopold Magnus 00:43:20 Right. But didn't you say I still had disadvantage for some reason? Because he had some ability. Or that was only if he had hit me. OK. OK. OK, good to know. Yeah, and that's only on melee attacks. Like a spell, that's not a melee attack, right?
Zariel Torgan 00:43:38 But if you start flanking him, you probably just get a straight roll.
Kaladin Shash 00:43:48 Now it's still range, potentially. Yeah. Shadow blade. Yeah. Oh, that's a, that'd be a dex.
Dungeon Master 00:43:48 It was a laced L attack, like there are certain ones that require that, but yeah. Next creature weapon is that. No.
Leopold Magnus 00:44:00 But like a Burning Hands, that wouldn't be a melee attack, right? Steel Defender swings and misses in his first turn. I am now being harried by Cedric. I'm going to position myself just slightly to stand shoulder to shoulder with Kaladin so I can flank with Zariel. Is that possible?
Dungeon Master 00:44:25 You'd have to take it in front of Kaladin, but that you would, you'd be able to like, you don't get hindered movement moving through party members like that. And that's like, it was obviously going to be an issue. So like you could step in front of him if he wanted to, but then he would have to move on his turn.
Leopold Magnus 00:44:33 Okay. Yeah. Um, okay. So I will, I will slide in and, uh, I'll, I'll say to Caledon, Oh boy, this guy seems like he's not messing around.
Leopold Magnus 00:44:53 Um, and I'm almost like a voice trapped in an, you know, automaton suit. Like the suit is, has gone into full fight mode and, uh, Levi's or, uh, Leopold's just kind of along for the ride here. And he, uh, mechanically slides his arm forward and a little tube comes out the bottom and just starts spraying flames. And I'm going to cast burning hands.
Dungeon Master 00:45:17 Awesome, that'll be a dexterity save. And what is the range on Burningham? If you.
Leopold Magnus 00:45:19 Yeah. Let's see. The dice are over it. Go away, please. 14. 15 foot cone, and I'm going to try to capture only Cedric. Is that possible if I kind of shoot it off of one of his shoulders and avoid hitting Zario there?
Zariel Torgan 00:45:26 Nine damage.
Dungeon Master 00:45:47 You would have to get back where you were to miss Zariel. Where you're at is either going to hit Zariel, or if you go the other way, you're going to hit the crowd and kill a bunch of people. So it's yeah, back where you started or or hit Zariel. And then. Let me check to see, I think. I have.
Leopold Magnus 00:45:57 Okay. Yeah, I was going to say, how about canonically I'll hit him with burning hands because it's just a deck save. And then I'll slide over in front of him.
Kaladin Shash 00:45:57 me.
Dungeon Master 00:46:16 A 15 foot cone I can do. Yeah. You can angle that bitch. I don't know why I did that, but yeah. Anyway, you can miss your still defender too.
Leopold Magnus 00:46:29 Wait. Cool, excellent. Yeah, that's what I'll do. I'll blast him with burning hands, avoiding companions. Yeah, the save was 14.
Dungeon Master 00:46:46 He got a 19. Okay, so he'll take half damage. Okay, anything else? And then you move correct, or do you want to stay there then?
Leopold Magnus 00:46:59 Yep, half damage, and it was nine damage. And yeah, I'll move in. So with Leopold trapped in a metal man who's on a killing rampage, it just kind of sticks its arm out and sprays flame all over him.
Leopold Magnus 00:47:25 And I will slot in in front of Kaladin, and with one of the Magic Stones, just narrow right down on Cedric. And then I think that would be a flat roll, because this is a melee, or a ranged spell. Magic Stone.
Dungeon Master 00:47:42 What are you doing? If it's a range to tech and you're within five feet, which you are, it would be disadvantage. But with advantage, yeah, 100%, you got it. That's right.
Leopold Magnus 00:47:55 With a flat roll, because we've got advantage. OK. Do they normally say ranged on a spell? Oh, it says range, area, touch. But that's just to bring the stones to life.
Kaladin Shash 00:48:15 Right, the action to use it is throw it. It's obviously a range attack. You can roll your roll your D4.
Dungeon Master 00:48:15 It gets tricky with spells because it has to account for the casting. 18 misses. Just barely though.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:20 Right, right. I'm just curious if it has to say that somewhere or not, but anyways. 18 ahead, I don't think that does. Yep, OK, and then with that. That would be my turn all. Oh yeah, blustering.
Kaladin Shash 00:48:47 One, put some on there. Beats it, beats it. Yeah, boy! All right, we know the number. We know the number.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:54 Ah, 19 to hit. Excellent. Bless for the win. Okay, Magic Stone will go flying towards Cedric, and it will do 9 damage. Right between the eyes.
Dungeon Master 00:48:58 19 just hit. What kind of damage is that?
Zariel Torgan 00:49:00 Oh, yeah. Stone.
Kaladin Shash 00:49:23 the fifth
Leopold Magnus 00:49:24 Yeah, stone, I don't know, where would it say that? Yeah, bludgeoning. It is bludgeoning damage, yeah. Oh.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:28 Bludgeoning. It's magical, magical bludgeoning.
Dungeon Master 00:49:33 It is bludgeoning, okay. Okay, good round. At the end of your turn, you've become kind of a nuisance, and because you've also done damage to him, he's going to take a legendary action and strike out at you. After your turn, technically, he can use it, so he'll just fit it, like, right in between.
Leopold Magnus 00:49:51 I guess would that happen before or after my still defender can go? Because that reaction just happens whenever, right? That does not hit. Okay, so that'll be a d20 plus six to hit.
Kaladin Shash 00:50:05 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:50:07 16, which I don't think hits yet. Okay. Then you're still Defender goes. 19 hits.
Leopold Magnus 00:50:23 Maybe. Yeah, I think that hits, that's 19 there. So, let me figure out what I should roll for this guy. Yeah, there you go. 1DA plus PB. What's PB? Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:50:29 Nice. Do lethal damage. Efficiency bonus. Probably plus three at this level. Plus two, okay.
Kaladin Shash 00:50:38 Is there such thing as a cure?
Dungeon Master 00:50:43 First, it's about it. Two. Bye.
Leopold Magnus 00:50:51 Ah, proficiency bonus, plus 2. Yep, got it. Okay. So 1d8 plus 2. Ooh, 7d8! And it is force damage, if that's important.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:02 Get him, little guy. Nice. All right.
Dungeon Master 00:51:12 All righty, all righty, a good turn. Yeah, sorry. You guys don't automatically know that you are, Zoriel, you are up.
Leopold Magnus 00:51:21 Yeah, with that, let's end on my turn.
Kaladin Shash 00:51:28 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:33 I have a logistical question for the DM. I have a spell called Flame Blade, which evokes a fiery blade in my free hand. Now, if I cast it, it's concentration, I can maintain concentration on spells while in my wild shape.
Dungeon Master 00:51:43 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Kaladin Shash 00:52:00 Yeah. Yeah, boy.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:01 Would I be able to be an animal wielding a sword made of magic? Like a gorilla or something? OK. Raccoon. All right. With that then, I am going to, let's see here.
Dungeon Master 00:52:09 If you need things into an animal that could wield a sword. Like a gorilla or a monkey, yeah. A raccoon. Otters. Turn into a gorilla.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:33 Yeah, I turn into Darth Vader, actually. Yeah. No, I'm going to turn into a giant constrictor snake. And I'm going to attempt to constrict him. Actually, I'm going to make the attack, and then afterwards... Oh, I have to see if I hit first. Okay, so let's try... Oh, actually, let me do a little bit of thinking here.
Kaladin Shash 00:52:50 Silence.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:02 I get advantage, right? All right, come on, big money, no whammies. Uh, 24. All right, he is currently grappled. And he takes... Yes. He takes 14 bludgeoning damage. And it's a DC 16 strength check.
Dungeon Master 00:53:06 Mm-hmm. 24 hits. Is he automatically grappled? A DC what?
Leopold Magnus 00:53:14 Hell yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:31 to become ungrappled. And that is my turn. DC 16 strength check. As I drop down and turn into like a giant snake, slither over and I slither up his leg while he's in the middle of bashing Leopold, I go over the shoulder and then under the leg and I just squeeze real hard.
Dungeon Master 00:53:40 Okay. Very nice. Do I have to get a snake token now?
Kaladin Shash 00:54:09 But. And.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:09 Say sucks to suck. I'm as slippery as an eel. Yeah. It's going to be canon that I make the best jokes and dialogue when I'm in a different form and nobody can hear me.
Leopold Magnus 00:54:14 Really slithering away there. I see Zario But again, all we hear is
Dungeon Master 00:54:24 You can't talk. When you're an animal, they just hear the animals. That's really funny. At the end of your turn, he's going to use another legendary action. He's just restrained, right? Or is he just grappled?
Zariel Torgan 00:54:39 What do you think, guys? What do you think? Yeah. I'm working on my tight five minutes. All right. Let me read what it says specifically. I think it says grappled. Sorry. Grappled.
Kaladin Shash 00:54:39 He thinks we have no appreciation for good humor. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:55:03 Oh no, sorry, sorry, sorry. It says, it says, until this grapple ends, the creature is restrained. So, it says both. And no movement. I would imagine since I'm, you know, on him.
Dungeon Master 00:55:03 Great. Cool. Restraint is just disadvantage on attacks against other creatures, but he would still have a normal attack on you.
Kaladin Shash 00:55:17 you.
Dungeon Master 00:55:30 just to weave it. That'll be a 24 to hit. You take 11 Bludgeoning and 1 Radiant, so 12 total. And because you did damage to him, he's gonna do... uses Tunnel of Vision, part of his special thing he adds on. I need a Pawn save.
Zariel Torgan 00:55:34 Oh yeah!
Dungeon Master 00:56:01 I think they're all cons, there's no one to deck save, okay. He doesn't have a saving throw, so it's the same. Yeah, so 11. So you are stunned until the end of his next turn.
Zariel Torgan 00:56:05 10 plus 12. So 11. Yeah. No problem. I'm just grappling him. So he's held even tighter now.
Kaladin Shash 00:56:08 You roll the check, is the number the same?
Leopold Magnus 00:56:31 He just passed out, wrapped him up, passed out. I don't know, I don't know about you.
Zariel Torgan 00:56:34 Well, I'm stunned, so my muscles are squeezing really hard, extra hard. Didn't think that through, huh, Kyle? You're what?
Dungeon Master 00:56:39 Mm-hmm. Kaladin, your turn. I'm just maybe going to Google it. He would have.
Kaladin Shash 00:56:44 Uhm? With him being restrained, does that give him disadvantage on? Look at dexterity saving throws. He can't dodge. Yep.
Dungeon Master 00:57:03 When a grappler is... blah blah blah... When a creature is stunned, it is also incapacitated, and the grapple ends automatically. That doesn't seem right. Yeah, but it was just a legendary action, so he can't move on his turn. He is not technically restrained.
Kaladin Shash 00:57:14 It's stunned you're now you just he like steps away from it. I guess if he wants.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:26 Oh, so he's not restrained anymore? All right.
Dungeon Master 00:57:32 But he can't move as part of his legendary action, so he's still right there. Kaladin, your turn, man.
Kaladin Shash 00:57:50 Excellent, thank you. I'm going to move so I've got. Some sort of line of sight, I guess, because it's getting crowded. I guess I don't want to be on the corner of the pit. And I'll just cast. Magic Missiles first level.
Dungeon Master 00:58:13 Nice. Go ahead and roll that damage. Nice. A solid 14.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:17 Nice. Nice. Nice. Jesus. That was fantastic.
Kaladin Shash 00:58:24 One. That's nice. Two. Yep. And then three. They're great rolls. They're great roll. Mark out slot. I'll use a little more. I'll just kind of stay close to the wall now.
Dungeon Master 00:58:42 Good hit. Didn't look like he liked that. That was a heavy hit from that spell. Hmm. Can he do any... What was that from? Okay. Ends your turn?
Zariel Torgan 00:58:52 Oh.
Kaladin Shash 00:58:57 And my turn.
Dungeon Master 00:59:15 Okay, at the start of his turn, he will use Bonus Action Calculated Loss, and because he is not grappled, he will move without getting anybody attacking an opportunity on him directly to you, as you are the one maintaining the Bless, and you hit him really hard. And he will take his three attacks on you.
Dungeon Master 00:59:47 23 to hit. Ooh, that's a natural 19, so a 26 to hit. And a natural 20 to hit. Okay.
Kaladin Shash 00:59:49 Oh, it's no matter what. Yeah. That hits. Oh man, I'm getting the ground. OK, yeah, they all hit. No point in casting shield. He has.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:58 Ouch. Oh.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:01 So did he still, oof. Did he take an attack of opportunity or did he still have that thing where he could move?
Dungeon Master 01:00:13 No, so calculated loss as a bonus section at the beginning of their turn and only if they have received damage on that round or on the previous round if they happen to be the first in initiative, they can choose to close range between them and an attacker without provoking attacks of opportunity. The target now has disadvantage in melee weapon attacks against Cedric and disadvantage in all dexterity and constitution saving throws.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:38 Okay. Did that, was he not restrained? Cause sorry, I was stunned. Ah, got it. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:00:42 No, the restrained ended when he stunned the snake. I didn't read this, so sorry Rex, but you could have ended the condition by spending half of your movement on your turn, similar to being prone. It says it at the end there. That was my bad.
Kaladin Shash 01:01:13 Oh, my gosh.
Dungeon Master 01:01:14 Hold on, there's this fucking car that is so loud, it shook our entire house. Jeez, I don't know how they have eardrums. Anyway, okay. Rolling damage on Paladin. Because you also did damage to him, he's gonna do... He's gonna attach an ability on each of them.
Leopold Magnus 01:01:20 I should. They probably don't. That's why they try so hard.
Dungeon Master 01:01:43 So the first one will be... You go at the end. So yeah, he'll do Tunnel Vision. So the first one will be a con save at disadvantage while he does damage to that. Oh, sorry, that was the wrong button. He already hit. I need to roll damage. Oh, first one's only...
Dungeon Master 01:02:13 6 bludgeoning damage. And 2 radiant, so 8 on the first. That's better. 11 plus. 4, so 15 on that second one. And the kick was then at 20. This is going to be a heavy hit.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:36 Mmph.
Dungeon Master 01:02:47 Not if he rolls low. One of my dice is stuck on the corner of my screen and it's not rolling. Yeah, it's at the very corner of my screen. All of all of that and it's like perfectly stuck in the corner.
Kaladin Shash 01:03:03 Tip your screen. Give it a good shake. It'll eventually calculate it. It'll figure it out. OK.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:05 Let's give it a good shake.
Leopold Magnus 01:03:06 Yeah, just type it.
Dungeon Master 01:03:18 Okay, 23 was the damage on that. He does radiant damage on all of his decks. You take 2d6 damage. 9 more damage.
Kaladin Shash 01:03:39 And what's that number? OK. It does.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:39 Oof.
Dungeon Master 01:03:52 That takes you out, doesn't it? Okay. One of his abilities is called Next Round. When I reduce a creature to two or under zero hit points, when the target is healed and becomes conscious again, you will do so with half of your hit point maximum. So whatever you heal for, your max for the remainder of the fight will be 24.
Kaladin Shash 01:04:22 OK, so it can't it can't be healed from Max more than that. OK.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:22 Interesting.
Dungeon Master 01:04:26 Yeah, so you won't be healed above 24 regardless, whatever it is. That was his full turn though. Next up is Leopold. That's a great question.
Leopold Magnus 01:04:45 Does a temporary hit point revive somebody All right Okay, so
Kaladin Shash 01:04:53 Yeah, just a hit point. Just a hit point.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:54 Yeah, I would imagine so. I can't see why not.
Dungeon Master 01:04:59 Yeah, we'll say yes. OK. Ice.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:12 It's starting each of its turn. OK, yeah. So Leopold will kind of whirl up into a sprint. What? OK, yeah, that's fine. All right, well, in this one awesome moment, Leopold will make the most out of it.
Dungeon Master 01:05:22 Said it's going to work, so it will work this time, but I did look it up. Going forward, temporary hit points do not bring somebody back up. But I did say it would work, so.
Kaladin Shash 01:05:31 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:05:31 Holy smokes
Leopold Magnus 01:05:41 So his gears whirling up, steam pistons churning, he slides past Cedric to scoop up Kaladin. And I stand him up on his feet and I slap him on the back while he's unconscious and I say,
Leopold Magnus 01:06:01 Let's go, chap! Back on your feet! You've got to get out there and win the fight! And I will cast Heroism. And he will, at the end of my turn... This is not how it would necessarily work, because he's unconscious.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:23 gains temporary hit points equal to my spellcasting modifier at the start of each of its turns. So you will regain six hit points, temporary hit points, at the start of your turn. And I will use that first level spell. And then with
Kaladin Shash 01:06:35 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:48 Magic Stone, I will send one out towards Cedric at disadvantage because I am right next to him. Oh, get rid of those dice. Get them out of here. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Shoots out of my left butt cheek.
Dungeon Master 01:07:00 Mm-hmm. Nice compromise between the two. Natural one. Uh... Zariel, give me a deck save. You're behind him!
Zariel Torgan 01:07:10 Terrible. Bounces off the Cedric's peck and it just knocks Callan back down. What? I'm, like, way over there. This is terrible. This is an abomination. Hey. Hey, um, did, uh...
Kaladin Shash 01:07:11 Natural one, where'd you sling that from? Yeah, I figured it was. Yeah, well, with and by.
Dungeon Master 01:07:30 And you're huge. That's fine, I'll say that passes. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:41 Did you ever roll to see, oh, you lost concentration because you went down. OK, all right. Damn. Oh, yeah, no, no.
Kaladin Shash 01:07:41 Oh, I went down. I'm sure I lost it. Even then, I would never be able to roll high enough with all the damage I took. Oh. No, Jonathan, Jonathan, Jonathan, I have a mirror image up.
Dungeon Master 01:08:02 Leopold, is that the end of your turn? Sorry, I got distracted. Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that alters all of Rex's turn, though, too.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:05 Yep, that's my action and bonus action. Oh.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:12 Oh. Damn. Yeah. 23, 26, 27. Jesus. If you roll all three here. Oh my God.
Kaladin Shash 01:08:13 I forgot all about that. Let me roll three times. Remember, we can look back at each hit. So first hit. Yeah. So hits my thing. Hits my thing. Hits my thing. I didn't take any damage.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:41 That's all right. The heroism thing doesn't even work that way anyways, so we don't need to do that.
Kaladin Shash 01:08:43 I'm at 47. Good looking out. Yeah. He just shaved everything down. It's just me standing in front of him.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:44 Jesus Christ. Yeah, it was meant to be.
Dungeon Master 01:08:59 Yeah, so all of his attacks hit everything else. Leopold, then you have your turn to do whatever you'd like instead then.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:11 Okay, so I don't need to move into his space to aid.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:34 Yeah, so I'll just, I'll whirl up my crossbow and aim it down at Cedric and I'll say, you best get away from my friends! And fire one off from my arm. Ooh, 26 to hit. All right, so nine damage on the crossbow.
Dungeon Master 01:09:53 Nice. 26 heads.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:07 And then with a, since I have two magic stones now, since we want to clock back a bit, I will do the same, but with magic stone. 17 and then would bless still be up because Caledon. Excellent. Ah, I think 19 is the DC, right?
Kaladin Shash 01:10:16 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:10:27 You would still have black. Yeah. Roll two. Still misses. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:38 Yep, okay, so the stone misses, at least it doesn't sling on by and hit Zariel. That's my action and bonus action, but then it'll be my Steel Defender's turn, and he'll shuffle over with some rather clunky movements, looking almost like a wind-up soldier.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:46 Heh, heh.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:05 his arm will go back and tense, and then you'll just see it flash forward with a strike of a sword. And this is a plus 6, so then a 22 to hit. And then this is a 1d8 plus 4, I think we decided.
Dungeon Master 01:11:21 22 hits. Now plus two.
Kaladin Shash 01:11:27 The end.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:34 plus two plus two right because that's my proficiency bonus yep got it 1d8 plus two ah what's the seven okay so four damage on the uh sword strike and then that is my turn
Dungeon Master 01:11:53 You guys notice that with all of your like slashing and bolts and and strikes made with mundane weapons and bolts and stuff are seemingly like just not hurting him as much as you feel like they should on purchase enough tax have happened now that it feels like he's not taking all of like arrows and stuff and the swords seem to glance a little bit more than you think they should.
Leopold Magnus 01:12:22 But the magic doesn't seem to do that.
Dungeon Master 01:12:26 Yeah, like the spells land full, magic weapons seem to land full, things like that. And then after Leopold is after, well, you shoot defender, he's going to use a legendary action, feeling very frustrated by this all and just make an attack on Kaladin for being such a pain.
Dungeon Master 01:13:02 Natural 1 misses. Nouriel, it is your turn. Uh, no. Not with the skill defender there.
Kaladin Shash 01:13:05 Yes, boy. Yep, piping.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:09 Is there any way for me to get opposite of an ally in this setup here? Can I push the Steel Defender out of the way?
Dungeon Master 01:13:31 Yeah, but this is more do I want to cost you action economy to do it I'm gonna say no you guys You really took the wind out of my character with that that reverse time thing. I'm gonna make it you can't push it here
Leopold Magnus 01:13:34 I mean, I just instructed it to attack. I don't think it would pay any mind. Oh, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:13:44 Yeah, that's what I started thinking about. That was so racist.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:56 Alright. My snake is gonna roll up and it's gonna use its tail to tap the steel defender and the steel defender's gonna be like, fuck off. I'm gonna come up this way. And I'm going to make another constriction attack. Come on, big money! It was not big money.
Dungeon Master 01:14:00 You don't get advantage, submarine. The natural one. Could you constrict the steel defender for just a second?
Kaladin Shash 01:14:18 Yeah, Lee.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:28 I get very angry that it won't move, and I lose sight of what I'm supposed to be doing. And I'm like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, that's right. I just take a big snake breath. I'm like, OK, OK, next time, next time.
Dungeon Master 01:14:35 This is a really emotive snake. Like, imagine to get really frustrated, it has to calm itself down, it takes like an exasperated breath. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:14:44 The steel defender kind of shakes your leg off of its foot as you try to wrap your tail around it.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:56 Uh, that's all I got. I don't have any bonus action economy as a snake. Good luck. Oh, hey, um...
Dungeon Master 01:15:01 Yeah, that was. That was his. First legendary action he's before he's going to use another one just because the snake got into the mix. Weirdly, he's going to punch the snake. Maybe Mrs 13.
Kaladin Shash 01:15:15 part of my thinking.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:23 No, 13 hits. Real quick, I forgot to check. You did stun me before you left. Did you say the stun lasted until the end of my turn or the end of his turn? Okay. Gotcha. Okay, we're good. Oof. Ouch. All right, I'm good.
Dungeon Master 01:15:32 No, it's his turn. The action economy is... it's not great for him to go so early in this. You take 14 damage on that. How much HP does the constrictor snake have? Damn.
Kaladin Shash 01:15:54 So much.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:54 Uh, 34. Starts off with 60. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I can have 120.
Dungeon Master 01:16:03 That's real nice for you as a druid, just to have a bunch of hit points. Now with his legendary action, then up next would be Kaladin then.
Kaladin Shash 01:16:24 Yeah, I still bless up. I'm gonna I'm gonna use my. Fe ancestry ability. And just missed step away. And then I will use. I keep some spell slots going here.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:39 Nice.
Kaladin Shash 01:16:57 I'll cast Firebolt at him. 22 to hit. I'm rolling hot. 10 damage. I want to say yes. I don't think I've got any other. I have like 10 more feet of movement, but nothing to do with it.
Dungeon Master 01:17:01 Roll to hit. 22 hits. Nice hit. Does that end your turn, sir?
Leopold Magnus 01:17:12 Nice. Why don't you roll it, Kaladin? You've been hot.
Dungeon Master 01:17:29 Who wants to give me a pure luck check? Yeah, just be a d20. It's fitting.
Kaladin Shash 01:17:38 It's a straight d20 We'll see not kick an ass on that one
Zariel Torgan 01:17:40 Yeah, Caliban's been kickin' ass. Oh. Low was supposed to be good though, right?
Leopold Magnus 01:17:46 Yeah, that's maybe that's how it balances out.
Dungeon Master 01:17:53 It's fitting that this happened with Callada and the one rolling it. The start of the round, Cedric is up. You see, he's looking very frustrated and he's looking pretty hurt, but it's more that he's not being as effective as he wants. You see, he's getting upset. His breathing is getting heavier. And then his fists actually start radiating with like golden light as he just starts to like his veins on his chest and his arms.
Dungeon Master 01:18:19 Pulse with radiant energy and his eyes get a faint glow to them You guys would recognize this it seems It seems very similar to when you fought that guy who turned into the the fire elemental or is like he's sort of pushing himself in this moment and he Whether or not whatever you knew it is first. I
Kaladin Shash 01:18:41 Moon. He's got the blood. Alright. Warm.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:46 Mm. Mm.
Dungeon Master 01:18:49 Service Child bonus action, he is going to use Calculated Loss. He's going to get his free dash that's without repercussions directly at Kaladin. Again, still seeing you as the problem child. He'll take his attacks at you. And he is under the... all that fancy talk did is he gets a little bit more damage and he's got blessed, essentially.
Dungeon Master 01:19:17 But I don't think that's gonna help him with this. A d4... Your AC is 14, right? And then you'd probably shield. He rolled a 10 to hit, so... On a d4 or 4, he's gonna... No, he misses. Okay, second attack. Not as impressive as the first round. Natural 1. Fake attack. Oh, fuck me, man.
Kaladin Shash 01:19:26 Yeah. Sweet.
Leopold Magnus 01:19:41 Peace. God's gonna turn into a demon.
Zariel Torgan 01:19:43 Jesus Christ.
Dungeon Master 01:19:50 That's 11 plus 1, 12 misses. 3 attacks, 3 misses. He is looking wild and you see he starts to glow more and more. With every miss that he doesn't land, he's getting more frustrated. After his turn, it is Leopold.
Kaladin Shash 01:19:56 Okay. Six wings.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:14 Yeah, so I see him swinging wildly over there and I kind of peer up from the backside of my steel defender and I kind of yell out meekly to Kaladin, watch out! I don't know if he's going to connect with one of those. And I'm going to do Witch Bolt at the second level and
Dungeon Master 01:20:38 Oh, good spell.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:40 As it works, Leopold's Cautioning Kaladin and an antenna just kind of emerges from the back of my shoulder blades and my whole suit of armor starts whirling up. And it's arcing a little bit off on my Steel Defender and kind of arcing into the air until it builds and fires towards Cedric. Okay, let me roll that.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:40 That is a fantastic spell.
Leopold Magnus 01:21:12 Ah, 17, I think it'll hit with Bless, because that's still up, right? Oh, baby, 20 to hit. Yeah, and that was at the second level, so that is a 2D12. Ah, could have been better. But yes.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:16 Oh, come on. Yeah, come on. Oh. Not bad, still average. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:21:18 It's still up, get it there. Yeah, just enough. It's okay, man, it's still up. And you can rip it next time.
Dungeon Master 01:21:18 Gotta roll a two. Nice.
Leopold Magnus 01:21:42 Yeah, so he's just sparking energy kind of off, and the little antenna subsides, and Leopold kind of looks around like, did I do that? And that's my attack, and then with my last magic stone, it will go hurtling over my shoulder, targeting Cedric once again.
Kaladin Shash 01:21:57 Ha ha ha.
Leopold Magnus 01:22:11 16, I think that could hit if I roll the Bless. Oh, baby. 4, so the Magic Stone makes a connection. 8 damage on the stone. And I'll yell at my Steel Defender, Onwards, Soldier! Take him down! And it will just kind of like slowly and mechanically just
Dungeon Master 01:22:15 Good hit, good hit. Does hit. Damn, that hits hard. What is your shield defender's movement?
Zariel Torgan 01:22:18 Nice. Jesus.
Leopold Magnus 01:22:39 Yeah, that's what I was going to double check. 40 feet. And I'll go. It's just it just marches in a straight line.
Kaladin Shash 01:22:41 It's growing. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:22:47 It takes 25 to get to them. 40? Nice. It's faster than you give it credit for. It's gotta happen within six seconds. I can't let that happen.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:47 Damn it. Don't. Don't take my spot, jerk. Leave it open.
Leopold Magnus 01:23:04 Just it says I can move 40 feet, but it happens really slowly. And then the arm mechanically just. Yeah, everyone's looking at it and they're just like, God, that thing should move faster. Yeah, but it takes a second. It ratchets its arm up gears, cranking and pauses, and then just hatches it down real fast and it'll attack.
Kaladin Shash 01:23:13 It takes a slow six seconds.
Dungeon Master 01:23:21 Everybody is concerned. Plus six. Definitely hits.
Leopold Magnus 01:23:36 Ooh, plus 6, that hits. And then that was a 1d8 plus 2 I believe. Ah, nice. So then another 9 damage. And that's my turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:23:40 Nice. Nice. It was a great round, you guys.
Dungeon Master 01:23:54 Very nice. End of your turn. Legendary action. Gonna punch Cedric. Cedric's not gonna punch himself. He's gonna punch Kaladin in the face. He might as well punch himself in the face.
Kaladin Shash 01:24:00 It's a good round. It's gone OK so far. I'm going to shield.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:11 I was gonna say, Kaladin's untouchable in this pit. He's like the... He's like the Grim Reaper. Nice. I'm gonna...
Leopold Magnus 01:24:18 It's like Matrix, man.
Dungeon Master 01:24:21 He hits with a 17, but does a... Are you going to shield? Figured. Okay, misses on that. Zariel, it is your go.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:37 I'd like to imagine that the Steel Defender went to go take flanking position, and the snake just hissed really loud, and then it recorrected and kind of moved out of the way. I'm gonna slither down here to the corner. I'm gonna say, now you're mine. Although it just comes out. All right. Get ready to be constricted.
Kaladin Shash 01:24:43 What is it? Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:04 Oh, this is almost a natural 20. Damn it. God damn it. All right. At some point,
Dungeon Master 01:25:08 Unfortunately, misses even with less. That's tough. All this hype around the snake. Kaladin, your turn. Actually, at the end of Zariel's turn, he's gonna punch you again in the face. He's gotta be able to hit you eventually. Oh, and he missed again. It's all he sees, he just keeps walking away.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:30 He's gonna start feeling bad for this snake. It's effectively just trying to hug him. The snake is just the neediest girlfriend. Just going over there, just trying to follow him around and hug him. It's not going well. Hmm.
Kaladin Shash 01:25:35 Yes, it does.
Dungeon Master 01:25:44 Does a 22 hit with shield. Okay, it'll be a d8 plus the d6, and he missed four times before hitting, so he deals an additional 4d4 radiant damage. Every miss is a catastrophic in this case.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:00 Jesus.
Dungeon Master 01:26:16 you take 28 points of damage as you see all of this light that had been building up in his body and running through his veins unleashes and it hits you directly in the stomach and you see this explosion of white light uh since you had also done damage to him uh he's gonna do uh uh out of breath on you uh so give me a dc13 con say but since he also used his
Kaladin Shash 01:26:20 Is that, is that, is that, is that still part, hang on, is that still part of his legendary action?
Dungeon Master 01:26:45 It's a disadvantage. Yes, it is just when he hits you with an attack, he can inflict one of these because you would hit him.
Kaladin Shash 01:26:50 Or are you just taking a turn? OK. Well, now the saving throw is going to be like a. It was 20. It was 14 before. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:07 Did you drop Bless yet, or is it still up? You have War Caster? Oh, okay. Come on, save. You can do it, come on. You get to use Bless, right? Oh, nice!
Dungeon Master 01:27:15 It's DC 14. Con save. Yeah, doesn't need to. Okay, but then go ahead and give me a.
Kaladin Shash 01:27:21 No. Is this a check? Is this a save? Or am I wrong? Can't save? I don't need to. Wait, so do I need to? OK.
Dungeon Master 01:27:37 Go ahead and give me a con save or have his effect take a place on you. And this is disadvantaged because he dashed at you, so his ability gives you disadvantage against him. But I won't... Yeah, yeah, I won't put it on the concentration check, but I'll put it on his effect. Yeah, yeah. Four.
Kaladin Shash 01:27:51 The concept of the effect is disadvantage. Okay. Who could have failed? It doesn't matter. So.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:01 Jesus. Just try for flavor.
Dungeon Master 01:28:02 out of breath. When he makes his jab attack, blah blah blah, air is suddenly forced out of your lungs. The target attack must speed on the Thiesty 13 to save. If the target fails, they cannot take any actions or reactions until the end of their next turn. So it's not his turn, it's your turn. You're essentially just stunned. I don't know why it has it phrased differently.
Kaladin Shash 01:28:21 I'm going to say that again. I have disadvantage on con just. OK, so I can't do anything.
Dungeon Master 01:28:31 yeah really unnecessary um oh i guess it's not done because um you don't have i don't have disadvantage i mean i don't have advantage on you that's probably what it does that uh bonus section i'm not loving the crowded thing he is going to calculated loss circle around without
Zariel Torgan 01:28:35 All right, I'll use my legendary action. Oh, okay.
Dungeon Master 01:29:01 Invoking the attack of opportunities. And then he will take, yes. He was in that space, which means he's got it. He's got at least five feet to move. Because you can't get closer than that to him.
Kaladin Shash 01:29:05 Can you move through that gap?
Zariel Torgan 01:29:11 Probably just difficult terrain.
Dungeon Master 01:29:26 Unless, we'll say, Rex, did you want Ellara to be on him, on him? Or did you want it where you put it? Sorry, the still defender, not the dead person. Okay, so the space is there. The space is there. You put it where you wanted to put it.
Leopold Magnus 01:29:38 Yeah, a single defender. Right, yeah, I just had positioned myself out of the way so the snake could make a spot there. His face is where? Yeah, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:29:51 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:29:57 Okay, yeah, so he does have that gap to swivel around. Too bad that he doesn't have any friends in this, because I don't have any advantage. Uh, natural two is for sure gonna miss. Uh... Do you have... It's the top of the round. You have shield until the start of your next turn, correct?
Kaladin Shash 01:30:26 Correct. Yet. In between, so it's still on, it's still on. Yeah. Or Mrs. Mrs.
Dungeon Master 01:30:28 And did you cast it at the end of... He used his Legendary Action. Okay, hold on. Yeah, okay, so he has a 14 to hit without Bless. A 17 total. Okay, you see he starts to glow again with those two misses. Third attack is his kick.
Zariel Torgan 01:30:37 Yeah, it was after. Yeah, you're.
Dungeon Master 01:30:59 That's a natural 20. Okay, so he only missed twice. You don't have luck, do you? Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, it's not like I'm struggling here. This one will make me feel good, though. I might be a little nicer to you on the next one.
Kaladin Shash 01:31:01 It definitely hits.
Zariel Torgan 01:31:06 I'm gonna ask you to re-roll that. No, I'm just asking. Oh, come on.
Dungeon Master 01:31:29 I just have to take one of you down, you know. You know how it is, Jesse. Kaladin, you take 35 points of damage. I believe that takes you unconscious.
Zariel Torgan 01:31:34 I tried to kill you guys as hard as I could every time. But that's just because I'm not a nice person. Oof. God.
Kaladin Shash 01:31:50 Yeah. Thanks.
Dungeon Master 01:31:58 But that was his last attack, so that is all three attacks. Now this actually takes place with his next round ability, where if you are brought back up, you'll have half your max HP, as like the top range. Since there are no shields. Leopold, you are up, sir. You've got pretty much the whole arena ahead of you, what do you want to do?
Leopold Magnus 01:32:33 Keep forgetting I'm on my phone, sorry. Uh, yes, so for my turn, um, I will kind of watch this happen in disbelief that Kaladin could be taken down so easily after dodging every strike thrown his way. Um, and you'll just see the antenna kind of emerge out of my back again, and almost like a clicking of a remote. Dedrick just lights up.
Dungeon Master 01:32:36 Very good.
Leopold Magnus 01:33:02 And I will use the Witch Bolt to do 1d12 damage to him. Ah. Damn. I think once, yeah. I can use my action to deal 1d12 lightning damage to the target automatically. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:33:13 Does which one stay on him, or do you still have to roll to hit each time? Just hits? Okay. As long as you are concentrating, yeah, yeah. I gotcha. Still good?
Kaladin Shash 01:33:17 No, just once it's connected.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:19 Once you hit, it's just on. It's crazy.
Leopold Magnus 01:33:32 So, uh, unfortunately not a big hit. He'll take 4 damage there. And then with my bonus action, I will launch my last remaining stone towards him. Ah! Literally flashed 14 and then it went 4. Damn. Yeah!
Dungeon Master 01:33:52 myth is then it just like rolled over close you see very quickly eyes glowing so he just ducks his head and it explodes on the stone wall behind him he makes eyes with you kind of romantically seductively but in this context you think he's probably coming for you next
Leopold Magnus 01:34:12 Oh dear, I think we should probably take this guy down before anything gets a little crazy. And I'll say, yeah, I'll call out to my defender and I'll say, sir, block his path, take him down. The steel defender will mechanically move over here in a very cumbersome way. And he will attack with his
Dungeon Master 01:34:21 Your Steel Defender can go. I'm going to put it right after you. Perfect.
Leopold Magnus 01:34:42 Sword. I don't believe that will do anything for me. Yep, so still defender Mrs. Man.
Dungeon Master 01:34:50 You know, he's been doing good so far on Misses and Order. At the end of his turn, Cedric will use his legendary action and he's going to punch the unconscious Kaladin. Melee attack, you are prone. He has advantage. Just higher stakes. He's not going to finish him.
Kaladin Shash 01:34:58 Oh, he's dirty. Shields up. Need to be good.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:10 What? I thought it just stayed up.
Leopold Magnus 01:35:12 That's just cruel.
Dungeon Master 01:35:21 19 to hit. Shield is down at this point. Yeah, yeah. You just have two fails. Yeah, it might not have been your turn yet, actually.
Kaladin Shash 01:35:29 Feel that concentration. Oh no, yeah, and it's into my turn. I went past my turn. I was done. Yep, I didn't take a turn. That's what I was thinking. Just you. I.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:43 What? It's not your turn. No, I mean, I don't want to be wrong, but he did it after Kaladin's turn as a legendary. It went back up the top past Leo's turn. It hasn't been your turn yet. Oh, even with shield? Oh, gotcha. Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
Dungeon Master 01:35:54 Yeah. Right, right, right. Oh, gotcha. OK, good to know, though. Does shield really not concentration? You just have that grip? That's so good.
Kaladin Shash 01:36:00 Right, but but 19 still would have hit me no matter what. Yeah, but 19 is exactly what the Army class would have been. Yeah. Just it's just up for it's up until the end of my next turn. Reaction.
Zariel Torgan 01:36:20 I mean, I could. I could. Yeah, I could see it dropping because that would make sense. But I think technically it's like spiritual weapon. Even if the cleric goes down, technically it's like still there. But unless you die, die. But I mean, I don't know. It could go either way.
Dungeon Master 01:36:32 It's still there, yeah. Love it. You have two fails, but...
Kaladin Shash 01:36:44 Yep.
Dungeon Master 01:36:46 He is not even looking at you. You don't... The other players, because you're not really seeing this, Kaladin is in like a fugue state where your vision is blurring and you're sort of just hearing your breath in your ears. You're not super paying attention to him, but Cedric does this attack, but he's locked in on Leopold, so you don't think that this is going to be like, I'm here to kill this guy. Zaryl, it is your turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:17 I need to do something here. I can't do anything as a snake, and if I drop my form, I lose all those hit points.
Kaladin Shash 01:37:40 It's okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:43 Um, is there any way I can make an acrobatics check or maybe climb up and slither up the wall and drop off in the corner? Or is there just not enough room for me to get flanking? Okay. Can I still get to a point where I can access him? Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:37:56 You couldn't get flanking. Yes, you could come around to like right here and get to him.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:07 Okay. Then I will slither around, and I'm going to try to get all up in his face and hurt his feelings. And maybe I'll be like, na-na-na-na-na, but in snake form. And I'm gonna try to constrict him again. That's gonna be 21. Alright, so that's gonna be...
Dungeon Master 01:38:27 It does hit. Lodging reduced to 8. He's not like on death's door, but he's not looking good.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:32 16 sneak damage, and he is restrained. As I squeeze him up good.
Dungeon Master 01:38:55 uh in between at the end of your turn and in between paladin's turn he's going to use his other legendary action he's going to uh same thing he's going to try to do before he's going to hit the snake uh to see if he can get you stunned i rolled a 13
Zariel Torgan 01:39:10 Good luck. Actually, I don't want to have luck. Uh, yes. So, I have here, under restrained, it says the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage. It doesn't say that it doesn't have disadvantage on me. For restrained.
Dungeon Master 01:39:20 And then whenever the D4 is a 4, 17. OK. You take the D8. Let me look it up. I don't want to rob you of it.
Zariel Torgan 01:39:43 I don't think he's gonna roll lower than a six, but it's worth a try.
Dungeon Master 01:39:59 Restrains here. SPD becomes zero. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. The creature's attack rolls have disadvantage. Okay, you'll roll with disadvantage. So the first one hit with the 17. Other ones a natural 15. Good looking out though. You take that.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:22 Damn it. All right. And then what's the save? All right, everybody. Big money. Damn it. All right. You said 14 damage.
Dungeon Master 01:40:29 Con save 13. And you take 14 total points of damage. Oh man, your con saves are killing it. Okay, you are stunned. Effectively, again, not grappled, but you are completely blocking the path. But now it is 14 total damage. Kaladin's turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:54 Okay, I got it. Don't you have two fails?
Kaladin Shash 01:41:01 Oh, here comes one death save coming up. Oh, didn't move. No, I have two fails right now. That was two of them. That was weird. Here comes one. And that's a fail. He punched me.
Dungeon Master 01:41:02 Go ahead and give me a death date. Okay, we'll touch on that in a second.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:26 Didn't he hit you? Wait, wait a minute. Didn't he hit you while you were unconscious? So this is a third fail? All right.
Kaladin Shash 01:41:31 Right, so I picked up two fails immediately. That was my first attempt to roll. So third fail. Third fail.
Dungeon Master 01:41:40 We'll touch on it in a second. Top of round is his turn. He will take, like I said, his bonus dash towards Leopold as he leaves this space. Zahra, you see across from the Steel Defender on the ground, Kaladin's breathing goes from like,
Dungeon Master 01:42:02 labored like he was struggling to keep his consciousness. And then you see his chest starts rapidly going up and down. He's like almost seizing, like his lung collapsed in the attack. And he just couldn't get it to sort of expand with a big enough breath. I'm going to give you a chance to administer some sort of heals. But I think this would be at the cost of like a stress point to you and not to him.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:31 I'll do it. I'll... I'll use, if I can... I didn't use a bonus action. So I will drop my form, and I will cast Healing Spirit. And you guys will see, rising up right about adjacent to where the Steel Defender is, a...
Dungeon Master 01:42:31 if you wanted to do it.
Kaladin Shash 01:42:38 Oh, thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:55 just spectral like greenish bluish kind of that iridescent hue tree that just grows up out of the dirt and sand and it just starts to emanate healing energy. You can roll a d6 of healing Kaladin.
Kaladin Shash 01:43:19 You want to do that now? Yeah. I'm up.
Dungeon Master 01:43:21 Mm-hmm.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:28 And we can do that three more times. So by the time your next turn comes around, you will be able to use it again, and then I can use it in the meantime. Jonathan, with Healing Spirit, can it only be 1d6 at a time, or can somebody pull as much off, like, lay on hands?
Dungeon Master 01:43:52 One piece at a time. Yeah, one piece at a time, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:55 Okay. That's fair. That's fair. It's already way too powerful as a spell anyway, so. Alright. Okay, I'm good. So I'll drop my form and it's me back here on the thingy. And I'll use this dead guy as the thing.
Dungeon Master 01:44:18 Perfect. As we go back to Cedric, as this is all happening in the background, Leopold, do you sort of see this over his shoulder as he rushes you? He's going to take his three attacks on you. 21 plus his D4, because I think 21 just barely hits.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:36 I'm ready. All shields. Which shield? It'll be 26, I believe. Let me double check that. Yeah, plus five. Yep, 26.
Dungeon Master 01:44:47 Okay, he's got a 24 total now, what's your AC? Okay, so he can't hit a second attack either. Yeah. Second attack missed, third attack miss. End of his turn, it is your turn.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:09 Yeah. Uh, so yeah, the whirling of my armor kind of anticipating the strikes and sliding out of the way. And, uh, Leopold just kind of getting rattled around inside this suit, as far as you can tell, screams, Oh my God, quit hitting me! And, uh, I will then, uh, strike him with, uh, an additional Witch Bolt.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:39 So, again, you see an antenna charge up, and he gets struck by lightning, or 1d12 damage. Come on. Ah! For fuck's sake. Dude, I think it rolled over a 10 and a 12, and then it hit that, yeah. Oh, well. So that's my action, and then...
Dungeon Master 01:45:52 Oh, yeah, you see the both parts.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:53 Jesus Christ.
Leopold Magnus 01:46:08 I will use, uh, as a bonus action, I will activate my backstones to get another 3 above me, and that is my turn. But, I still have my Steel Defender, who will then charge up and strike with advantage. Ah, yes it is. Natural 20.
Dungeon Master 01:46:28 Yes it will. Natural 20. What kind of damage can this dude do?
Kaladin Shash 01:46:33 Oh. Here you go, still the fender.
Zariel Torgan 01:46:33 Nice. Jesus.
Leopold Magnus 01:46:35 So then it would be 2d8. Yeah, I think it's a 1d8, so 2d8 doubled, plus 2, so it'll be plus 4 instead. And somehow manages to do more damage than my Witch Bolt. Yep. And that is my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:47:02 Good hit. After your turn, he's going to use a legendary action and strike at you. Again, you see with every miss, he glows a little bit brighter and brighter, like a nuclear bomb. Your turn ended, so your shield drops, but he's got a, he wouldn't hit. He's got a 16 and D4 only gets him 20. So he misses on that, going a little bit brighter. Your Steel Defender went. Zariel, it is your go.
Zariel Torgan 01:47:32 Alright. How do I want to play this? So I start my turn within the aura. I'll take d6 and that'll leave 2d6 for Kaladin. Nice. I'll do that real quick. And that's just automatic, that doesn't take any action economy for me.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:00 Okay, and then I'm going to, let's see. Bonus action, I'm going to, can I do action to attack, bonus action, cast a spell that is a bonus action spell?
Kaladin Shash 01:48:31 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:48:32 Yeah. Natural one.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:34 Okay, so I don't get advantage, because the guy's in the way. I'm going to use another second level spell, and I'm going to imbue myself with Flame Blade, and then with an action I'm going to try to hit this guy. Oh, man.
Dungeon Master 01:49:00 Do you wanna like slyly hit the skill defender or just waste it again? No, come on.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:03 I would like to fully smash this steel defender. No, that's okay. That's okay. I'd like to say I get really full of myself because I'm using a lot of abilities I haven't used before and I run over and I summon the sword and it's like turning on a lightsaber and it just shoots right past my face and it kind of throws me and I fall down but then I stand back up and I'm ready to do the next round.
Dungeon Master 01:49:35 Takes you off guard just by a second. At the end of your turn, he's going to use his second legendary action. You know, Leopold is just too hard to hit. He's going to try his odds on the new foe, Zariel. There's no point in hitting the Steel Defender.
Dungeon Master 01:50:08 Damn it, man. What's this? He's 15. Okay, he can't hit at all. He had a 10 on the die. So I'm sorry, three plus 10. Three plus seven for 10. Misses goes right over your shoulder next to your head with hard. You can feel the heat radiating out of his body as he keeps
Zariel Torgan 01:50:15 Oh, gotcha.
Dungeon Master 01:50:28 missing and you see his eyes get brighter and they're almost beams of light as he looks almost like he's gonna explode. Kaladin, your turn. You just got fucking rocked, but you're up. You take a d6 healing at the start of your turn.
Kaladin Shash 01:50:46 Yep. Another one. Sorry man, they add up. They add up, sorry, it's coming. It's coming, it's great. But I can't use it. Next round. It's a bonus action to use my suit though, correct? I haven't used that feature at all.
Zariel Torgan 01:50:50 oh jesus christ there's still another one there's still another one i well i can i can uh if you uh i guess you wouldn't know never mind you don't know what the spell does never mind oh yeah nice
Leopold Magnus 01:51:03 administer.
Dungeon Master 01:51:13 Yeah. 24 plus 2. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:51:14 That's a 2D4 plus 2. Hold soft.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:26 Oh! Jonathan. Is it too late to retcon and say instead of taking heals from the spirit that Calvin could use, that instead I would just use my suit's healing? Oh, okay. Alright.
Dungeon Master 01:51:45 Yeah, I'm going to say it's too late for that. Yes, you just have to move to get up, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:51:49 It's totally fine. All right, let's see if we can just help out a little bit here. I think I will, being pretty frustrated, I should have enough room for movement. Oh, was I prone? Did I have to get up after being gone? Oh, I can't get close enough to do any melee.
Zariel Torgan 01:52:11 Ooh. Ouch. Nice.
Kaladin Shash 01:52:19 That's a bummer. I'll give myself a better angle and I will cast. I'll do chromatic orb. It's going to be 21 to hit. And we'll hit him for 16. Whatever flavor damage you want. Let's say thunder damage. Or is that an option? One of six, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:52:29 All right, all right. 21 heads. Good hit.
Kaladin Shash 01:52:49 All right. Yeah, I already moved 10 feet. I only have like five feet left. I will finish him.
Zariel Torgan 01:52:49 Nice!
Dungeon Master 01:52:51 cacophony of noise, almost like a sound wave hits him on the side of the head. And you see it damn near knocks him off his feet. But he sort of just recovers and stumbles and gets back up. He's looking rattled. He lets you end your turn. At the start of the round, it is his turn. Looking
Dungeon Master 01:53:21 more animalistic than human and almost angelic with how much radiant energy is coming off of him. The crowd seems worried like they haven't seen this before. He will... I will... Calculated loss. He's going to close the distance with Kaladin.
Kaladin Shash 01:53:36 All right, just wasting hits on me, you guys can hit them. That's gonna hit no matter what.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:47 Oh, shit.
Dungeon Master 01:53:56 That'll be 20 to hit without a d4. You don't have a, do you have a shield available? I was gonna say, yeah. How many hit points you got? Zero. Eight on his, without the radiant damage. So you just go down, second attack.
Kaladin Shash 01:54:03 I could have had one spell slot left at two, so I could cast it, but it's not worth it. Just eight. Whatever you roll is going to take me down. Unless you roll real soft. There you go.
Dungeon Master 01:54:23 He will running leap over the steel defender and do his second attack and his kick onto Zariel as he comes in. First one's a natural one, misses. Here's the big one, the kick. That's a 21 to hit. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:47 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 01:54:52 It is still his turn, so I haven't missed all of it yet, but he had missed five times in a row prior wasting attacks on Leopold. That damage should have been applied to Kaladin, but it... Do you want it to go to him? Okay, so you would have taken... I don't think it'll outright kill you, so it's all part of the same deck.
Kaladin Shash 01:55:05 Oh no, it should hit me. It wouldn't. It wouldn't have killed me, doesn't matter, yeah. Woo, how much so? Was that is that a D4 every time he gets to do that extra damage?
Dungeon Master 01:55:24 It would have been 19 extra damage. Yeah, you're fine. So, he's at 0 for this. Every time he misses an attack, he builds 1d4 radiant damage. So, attack missed, kick hit, so that'll be...
Zariel Torgan 01:55:34 Woof. Yeah, that's rough.
Kaladin Shash 01:55:39 Yeah, that adds up.
Leopold Magnus 01:55:50 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:55:53 D12 plus D6. Five radiant and 15 on the bludgeoning. You take 20 total. And go ahead and give me a constitution saving throw.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:16 Oof. All right. Dirty 20. Wait, I did that as advantage because of my concentration check. Was that for something different? Because I wouldn't have advantage then.
Leopold Magnus 01:56:21 Thank you.
Kaladin Shash 01:56:24 Don't get stunned. There you go.
Dungeon Master 01:56:29 You're fine. Yeah, this is just his ability. This is not the maintain spell. For his stun, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:40 Okay, so I maintained the spell, and then now I'm gonna roll again straight for the stun thing. Oh, god damn it. Okay, I'm stunned. That's a seven. Damn it!
Dungeon Master 01:56:55 It's not updating. Oh, there it is. Okay. Yes, you are stunned until the end of his next turn. Okay, you've got your heavy hitter Leopold pretty much untouched. End of Cedric's turn, it is Leopold. Leopold, he looks hurt. He is, like, his skin is singeing. He's got open wounds that are, like, weeping.
Leopold Magnus 01:57:12 Okay. It looks a little crispy. Oh dear, Cedric! I think you might need to tee the barkeep over there. You're looking a little overheated. In just about that time,
Kaladin Shash 01:57:18 Did you get some?
Dungeon Master 01:57:25 Uh, he's like out of breath and stumbling. He is he is on death's door Here all your damage
Leopold Magnus 01:57:41 And it kind of shoots up my back and strikes a lightning bolt straight down at him. I will hit him with which bolt and hope to God it's higher than a one. Yes. 11 damage. Strikes him. Yeah, so Leopold is a little bit timid, like I said, it's almost like he's strapped inside a giant death machine.
Kaladin Shash 01:57:54 There you go.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:54 Ah nice You
Dungeon Master 01:57:54 Nice. Cedric, how do you want to knock him unconscious?
Leopold Magnus 01:58:09 And, uh, giving fairly honest advice, uh, he directs Cedric to the barkeep over here, um, to cool off. But without really seeming to control it, uh, his suit charges a monstrous bolt of electricity conducting from his feet all the way through his hands, eventually emanating out of a antenna, uh, sticking from the top of his armor and a
Leopold Magnus 01:58:38 rack of lightning comes down, slicing Cedric into... crispy. And Leopold goes, OH DEAR GOD, OH JESUS CHRIST. Well, I don't know if the lightning bolt is something that Leopold can control. Uh... Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:58:49 I'm sorry, are you killing him?
Zariel Torgan 01:58:50 You're murdering this guy? Yeah, we can bring him up.
Kaladin Shash 01:59:00 Well, I don't it only took him down. We could stabilize him for questioning. Right, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:59:07 Yeah, so, you know, I mean, he's not murdering him for the sake of murder, but he certainly is unleashing a wicked attack. So maybe I'll say canonically that lightning just leaves a pattern of like fractal lightning kind of singed into his skin with most of it concentrated across his chest.
Dungeon Master 01:59:43 Alrighty. A breath of silence is held as he falls to his knees, smoking, scorched, his eyes rolled back, all the light fading, and then he just falls forward into the sand, and the crowd erupts into cheers. Everybody's so fucking stoked. Calvin, give me a death save.
Zariel Torgan 02:00:14 At this point, since it would have been my turn before his death save, can I use an action to raise that guy and a bonus to move my spirit over and use its last charge to bring him up? Okay. The spirit's gonna move over Kaladin, give you a d6, and then I'll reach out and use a first level to bring him up with a...
Dungeon Master 02:00:26 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:00:41 What was that healing word, Sabio? 1d4 plus 3. So he's got 5 hit points now. Just kind of reach out and just kind of put my arm under his armpit, under his shoulder, and kind of just try to help him up. You did well, especially against 3 tough foes.
Dungeon Master 02:01:03 You see it takes him a second, he goes, oh, he starts laughing. He's like, man, that was a good fight. I haven't been challenged like that in months. He sort of stretches, you see his muscles ripple. Some of the dirt sort of flakes off of the ashes. God damn, did you fucking shock me?
Leopold Magnus 02:01:28 Why? I don't know. Well, yes, there may have been some of that.
Zariel Torgan 02:01:28 but but
Dungeon Master 02:01:41 And he goes, I gotta fucking hand it to you. That was a good fight. And he grabs at Leopold's arm and raises it in the air and he goes, ladies and gentlemen, you're champion for the night. And the crowd goes crazy. And you see, uh, you had the moment to stop him, but he turns and he like goes to walk to sit down, uh, and go ahead and give me an insight check. Uh, I'll say Zario because you were the closest cause you helped him up.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:08 Hmm. God damn. Can I? Well, I don't know what the action economy looks like if we're in loose initiative or not.
Dungeon Master 02:02:15 You know, I wanted it to be high, but it wasn't. He seems like something's up. Out of initiative.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:33 Can I just take a peek at the little Hand of God sigil thing and see if anything on him is just different or used up or just anything like that? Okay. God damn it, I'm just gonna fall over.
Dungeon Master 02:02:48 Give me a pretty specific ask. Give me... You can give me perception. I know that's what you want. You are not convinced that that is what Leopold told you it was? And with a natural one,
Kaladin Shash 02:03:03 Yep.
Dungeon Master 02:03:17 You're not even sure this is your guy. You see, Zaro kind of loses his cool for no reason.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:19 You know, I'm starting to doubt this whole operation. I'm going to go over and I'm going to kick that steel defender. Just going to start kicking it. You stupid fucking god damn. That's it, that's all I'll do.
Leopold Magnus 02:03:32 Well, Zario, take it easy on that thing.
Dungeon Master 02:03:35 and unless you stop him he's gonna he's gonna try to like you see the guy was coy about it he sort of brought the attention to leopold for the finishing blow you guys you know you got these huge winnings 500 gold from him you guys take a cut of the house pot which was an additional thousand gold
Zariel Torgan 02:03:54 Jesus. That's pretty good. Yeah, that's why I'm a drink. We got the money.
Kaladin Shash 02:03:55 So each of us is taking how much? Yeah, so we're each pulling. Great. OK, that's great. Yeah, I would. I want to follow him. We want to talk to him the whole time.
Dungeon Master 02:03:55 But like everybody swarms it. No 1000 total. You don't each get 1000 and it was 500 from him, but it wasn't 500 apiece. So you got 1500 to split up. But the crowd sort of swarms you and since nobody stopped him, he's moving this way.
Leopold Magnus 02:04:10 for each take 500.
Kaladin Shash 02:04:28 Where are you going, friend? Did what happen?
Dungeon Master 02:04:33 And he goes, as you approach, you guys will have this sort of one-on-one, as you sort of sneak through the crowd first, as they're already sort of celebrating Leopold. And he goes, I gotta say, I'm sorry for that. I've never had that happen before. I mean, I've got this ability to channel some power, I always have, but never like that.
Dungeon Master 02:05:01 I felt almost beside my own body. It was surreal. Yeah, it almost didn't feel like myself at times. But like I said, that was a good fight. And that's, no offense, good to know about myself. I don't think any one-on-one fight will ever be the same.
Kaladin Shash 02:05:06 You seemed rather wild for a moment. Welcome home.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:26 hmm if you don't mind me ask oh am i am i not over there i guess oh okay i'll give it a few beats and i'd like to eventually get over there
Dungeon Master 02:05:32 You didn't sneak through. This is going to be a Kaladin, Cedric moment. I mean, it's what you saw. I've always had a gift of the divine. I follow, you know, the goddess Ika, and then been working on honing my abilities most of my life.
Kaladin Shash 02:05:40 What kind of power do you normally tap?
Dungeon Master 02:06:02 It's never been more than just like kind of a harder hit, you know, makes me good in an arena fight, but. Again, I just wanted to apologize. I've never hit somebody so hard they like exploded. No.
Kaladin Shash 02:06:17 The goddess you follow, do you belong to any other followings? Had you an insight? No. Oh, it was a 19, and then it wasn't. Then it wasn't.
Dungeon Master 02:06:32 Give me an insight check. You can't. You don't you can't like he rolled low, but you rolled lower. You know, metagame wise, it definitely seems as if he's lying, but in the moment,
Kaladin Shash 02:06:47 We're just failing hard on these. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:07:02 it doesn't seem like an outright lie. You can tell he's hiding something, like maybe he didn't give you all the information with that statement, but now that you're close enough and he says, you know, he's been a follower of the goddess Ica, the hand, the right hand palm facing out is classically the symbol of the, sorry, I said Ica, it's Viteo, the goddess of justice and wrath.
Kaladin Shash 02:07:32 So the hand of the god symbol is also sort of. OK.
Dungeon Master 02:07:35 Is is a is yeah it is um like a very commonly part of one of the prime pantheon gods. But I will say you know that it's all it's never it's almost always like just a palm and the finger spread out facing outward. His is very specifically curled forward and you don't know if that's stylistic you don't know if that means something. That's just the only thing Leopold noticed at first.
Kaladin Shash 02:08:02 Okay. Okay. Is this the only thing you do? The only fight in this ring?
Dungeon Master 02:08:20 It's all I need to do. I meet the people I need to meet, make a good living, and I constantly get to practice. What more do you want in life? I'm sorry. Is this the start of your guys' questions, by the way? I'm not going to give you unlimited. We'll say those are on the house. Next one's a part of the deal. Anything after that will cost you a drink. And he sort of shoots you a grin, but he's missing a couple teeth.
Kaladin Shash 02:08:33 No, I'm waiting for my friends. We're just chatting.
Dungeon Master 02:08:51 Uh, and then they sort of like we'll say this is the moment where they like look back at the rest of the group like You know Come on Nice, uh
Zariel Torgan 02:09:02 Alright, I'll make my way over, and I'll just try to stand next to Kaladin. So, out of game, do we want- oh, go ahead, sorry.
Leopold Magnus 02:09:11 I'll do the same, come up plank on this side though.
Dungeon Master 02:09:21 Oh, you're talking to your party. Now go ahead.
Zariel Torgan 02:09:24 Yeah, at a game, do we want to chat a little bit just to make sure we know what we're trying to do? Because if we have like a limited amount of questions, I don't want to just burn through a bunch of stuff before we know for sure what we're trying to accomplish. Do we get
Kaladin Shash 02:09:35 Yeah, that's fine. I think all we know is that we were investigating the extremists, the cultists. He is the only lead that we had. And he maybe is a member of that.
Leopold Magnus 02:09:46 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:09:49 Yeah, do we get the impression that he's affiliated? Because, I mean, they were all, like, words cut into their flesh and, like, killing themselves and he just seems to, like, have, like, a...
Kaladin Shash 02:10:06 He might just know information about people that are in the cold or where they practice or where they.
Zariel Torgan 02:10:13 Yeah, he might just like, oh, yeah, I got this hand from like a guy I played poker with or I don't know. I mean, that'd be dumb, but I mean. I like our our characters weren't there to see that he was shadily answering the questions about his gods and things like that, so. We would be under the impression that those were all solid. I don't know what what what do you guys think that we should
Zariel Torgan 02:10:43 really press him on. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Well, I won't be the asker, but I can be there to check insight and things like that.
Kaladin Shash 02:10:45 We know that he's got that little medallion thing tied to his hip. That's an easy marker to question him on, if he tells the truth about it. As we understand it's affiliated with something else, right? That's just a good question. We can certainly follow through and ask if,
Kaladin Shash 02:11:13 If you ever encounters or works with people from. The hand of the God. Right, if this is where he meets people. Anyone else want to ask anything specific? Great.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:27 Yeah. Yeah, we could. Yeah, we could also ask him what his opinions are on the cult.
Leopold Magnus 02:11:30 I think that's that's pretty good. I mean obviously he is pretty well plugged in so he should at least know I don't think he's probably part of the occult though But maybe we should ask him about that symbol on his belt at some point
Kaladin Shash 02:11:43 I think that's a good first question. It might shape how long. Sure. Okay, what are the rules here, Cedric? How many questions do we get to ask for beating on the ring?
Zariel Torgan 02:11:52 And see if he reacts like say those crazy people in the cult and see if he like Gets a little angry or or I don't know just as another option All right, well i'm good
Leopold Magnus 02:12:01 Yeah, that's a good idea.
Dungeon Master 02:12:16 You're pretty vague, but we can call it a reasonable amount. Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:12:23 reasonable amount okay my friend um we are aware of many things happening within the dome i want to know because i mean we still have our uniforms on right i mean this looks he understands that what who we are what we are yeah i want i want to know more about the medallion you have tied to your waist belt what is that to you
Dungeon Master 02:12:55 It's a very pointed question. Well. It's fair. Ran into some friends recently. Through our connections, I've got a pretty good gig going where. I find some talent, I send it their way. Scouter. If you will.
Kaladin Shash 02:12:58 You said I could ask them. Excellent.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:18 Hmm. Interesting.
Kaladin Shash 02:13:31 Who might these friends of yours be? You'll tell us this, yes.
Dungeon Master 02:13:38 uh the religious type zealots of their own i don't totally know everything goes on but uh i can tell you where they're based out of that's what you're sort of poking at no i will i understand you guys are are the official type takes the beer
Zariel Torgan 02:14:00 I'll hand him a beer.
Dungeon Master 02:14:05 Cracks it open with just his hands, and he goes, but I will remind you that you are far from home. You will do well to watch threats. He gives you a realistic look like, oh, yeah, I do this dance. Looks at everybody else, he goes.
Kaladin Shash 02:14:15 There was no threat there. You said you will answer. I don't want to ask you the answer. I said you will. I'll tell you.
Dungeon Master 02:14:31 Obviously, you probably figured Don District is where you want to look for religious types. But from what I hear, I've never been there. They operate out of one of the chapels. Again, couldn't tell you where, but it's like in a basement type of operation. They're not openly preaching anywhere.
Leopold Magnus 02:14:50 Oh.
Kaladin Shash 02:15:02 Would you arrange for us to be the talent that you connect to them? Yeah. Yeah. Put that one in before we run out of questions. I'm not asking you to do that.
Zariel Torgan 02:15:07 It's exactly what I was thinking. Fantastic.
Dungeon Master 02:15:11 I mean, uh, I do, I do again, appreciate the good fight from you fellows, but I'm not so dumb to know that what they do is completely within bounds of the law, but I'm not just going to send some, some Legionnaires knocking at their door. I think that is what you ask. Here's what I will do for you.
Kaladin Shash 02:15:33 Just make the connection. You can have some of your gold back. I'm here every day.
Dungeon Master 02:15:42 I don't need the money, man, I'm here every night. He goes, he pulls the symbol, and you see it easily detaches from, it's not part of the rosary, it's just, it was hung on it. And he goes, when I send people to them, I give them this to show. I'll hand this to you. Rather, he sets it on the bench next to him. I'll leave it. And if you find your way their way,
Zariel Torgan 02:15:43 Hmm You
Leopold Magnus 02:16:00 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:16:10 and you have the common sense and wherewithal to show it, maybe if you look less like Legionnaires, they might let you in. Take out a couple, one silver out of here.
Kaladin Shash 02:16:19 Thank you. You fought very well. Do we all, do we all have beers or is he just, does he have the one? You got a round of them? That's great. I raised my tankard. Comrades, is there anything you would like to know?
Zariel Torgan 02:16:28 I got beers. I just grabbed a bunch because I took a while getting over. Alright. I can do it. Um.
Leopold Magnus 02:16:37 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 02:16:54 Jonathan, would you consider it metagaming if I asked him, since I wasn't there for it, to clarify a little bit about where he gets his power from? As a player, I know that Kaladin failed on that, so if it's not, then I'll drop it.
Dungeon Master 02:17:15 As a player, you know he failed. As a character, you don't know it's been discussed. You know, maybe you're just 10 seconds late to a joke and you say the same thing over again kind of deal. We all have fun.
Zariel Torgan 02:17:28 I've done that many times. Oh. Yeah, well then, I'll just, you know, clink glasses as we all drink a little bit, and I'll just kind of offhandedly be like, you know, Will, I don't think I've ever seen something quite like yourself there, Cedric. Where did you get that extra boost from?
Kaladin Shash 02:17:31 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:17:33 Paris.
Zariel Torgan 02:17:57 It was quite compelling, something that could be learned perhaps.
Dungeon Master 02:18:03 looks at you seriously, then puts it together that you weren't part of the conversation and goes, oh, yeah, sorry. At this time, one of the waitresses walks up and hands him a raw cut of meat that he puts over his swelling eye and goes, yeah, sorry. When I was younger, I'd always had sort of a knack for channeling. I didn't know it at the time, but it just felt like power.
Kaladin Shash 02:18:16 with you.
Dungeon Master 02:18:32 at a pretty young age, growing up in, you know, just in between houses, like most of the kids in this district, found our way to the religion, so to speak. Chapel of Viteo always had a home for us, so I spent a lot of my time following the teachings of Viteo. And he doesn't elaborate, because it is, you know, common knowledge that Viteo, as one of the prime deities, is very well known.
Zariel Torgan 02:19:01 Yeah. All right. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:19:01 stapled deity of like the justice system equivalent, right? And he goes, and I was telling your friend here, I'm sorry, I don't know that I got your name, but that's never happened. I do want to apologize to all three of you. I've never done that. But I will say I haven't.
Kaladin Shash 02:19:16 I never lost it like that in the rain. I got really irked there for a second. Ted, I have one last
Dungeon Master 02:19:30 I haven't been pushed that far in a long time. That was a hard fight. I almost felt like cheating for a second, but uh... I didn't... I wasn't... I didn't... I don't heal well.
Zariel Torgan 02:19:34 Yeah. Well, uh.
Kaladin Shash 02:19:44 I have one last question for you, perhaps my friends have more, but one more for me. In the future, could we perhaps rely on you for aid or other information, as a sign of good faith, if we assist you with anything? Done. I'll just grin back at them.
Dungeon Master 02:20:02 He just grins pretty wildly and he goes, beat me in the arena. You can make the same request. Missing also a couple of teeth. He goes, OK.
Kaladin Shash 02:20:16 Yeah, I've put down twice, like rapidly, like no chances.
Zariel Torgan 02:20:16 That was rough.
Dungeon Master 02:20:25 Yeah, go ahead and give me an arcana check.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:35 The
Kaladin Shash 02:20:49 It's super common knowledge. This is above the table really quick too, Jonathan. The curse is really well known, but do people turn, okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:20:55 What?
Dungeon Master 02:21:01 Mm-hmm. It's not common. It's well-known, but again, it's one of those things where it was like a fraction of the original population of the people who were cursed made it to other cities. And it is under investigation why so many people are apparently cursed right now, because it just statistically doesn't add up.
Dungeon Master 02:21:29 And it is heard of that people will turn into monsters, but public knowledge is that it's a random event. As legionnaire soldiers, it's been explained to you a little bit that people's actions, motives, and intent will inform a transformation depending on circumstances.
Kaladin Shash 02:21:38 Okay, but there's no. Right. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:21:54 And his sort of circumstances for what we will call an awakening is he was cornered on all sides and he was searching to do more power. He couldn't do anything about missing, but he wanted to make sure that when he hit, it was going to really be effective. So he basically became a bomb. But that's not something that everybody knows about, which is why you saw
Zariel Torgan 02:22:22 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:22:22 The crowd was sort of nervous about the whole thing that it was it was like you were fighting a monster until he was just fine No, that's why the Legionnaire is pretty popular because like when monsters do just randomly throw up in the cities They've usually got to get put down this seems This is like an abnormal case. This is like you basically found like the equivalent of you
Kaladin Shash 02:22:26 OK. But there. Right, so. It's not common enough that people see it and there's no system for like turning people in that might be suspected of being cursed. OK.
Leopold Magnus 02:22:57 to a
Dungeon Master 02:23:03 Yeah, you see, now that you look at him, and you're sort of just watching removed from the distance as they ask questions, when you had seen him before he had had these just like white cloth strip wraps as like his, his fist wraps for his boxing.
Dungeon Master 02:23:20 He's no longer wearing wraps but he's got like what looks like tattooed inlaid gold wraps that crawls up from his fist partway up his forearms. It's weird that you missed it at first but you kind of understand that it almost looks like sweat and dirt. Like he was just fighting in a pit, maybe he's just dirty. But like he shifts a little bit in his chair and you see the linting off of his forearms. His body is sort of like transformed with him pushing himself.
Leopold Magnus 02:23:51 Does it look like? Yeah, sorry. What does it look like again?
Zariel Torgan 02:23:52 Hmm.
Kaladin Shash 02:23:53 Hello. Hello.
Dungeon Master 02:23:56 Did you say does it look like or what does it look like? Like instead of having his fist and forearms wrapped like a boxer, it's like gold wraps, but it's part of his skin, like his hands are just made out of some sort of arcane flesh metal wrap. That's like he just looks like he his his body is transparent.
Leopold Magnus 02:24:22 OK, interesting. Right? Yeah, he just kind of like took some of it in, and it changed him a bit. Got it. Ateo was the god that he would be worshiping? Ateo. OK.
Dungeon Master 02:24:25 but it's only from fingers up to three quarters of his forearms. He didn't fully transform into a monster. Yeah, V-A-T-E-Y-O, Pateo.
Kaladin Shash 02:24:25 Silence. Silence.
Leopold Magnus 02:24:53 I will, what's that, go ahead.
Zariel Torgan 02:24:53 Um, well, I, I just, uh, real quick, I know it's from pretty far back, but I didn't want to step on anybody. Uh, I asked originally about the religion thing. I was hoping if I could see if I believed him that that was legitimately where he got his stuff from and all that jazz. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:24:55 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:25:17 Yeah, we'll say this is all concurrent, right? This is all happening at the same time. So while you're sort of asking these questions, Leopold is like, standing, you guys see like, notice, he's like 10 feet separated from the group, just sort of on the edge of the pit, just watching this interaction. So he's picking up on these details, as you guys are having this conversation. So he goes through all of that. He says that line, and you want to make an insight check.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:31 Okay. All right. God damn it. All right, nevermind.
Dungeon Master 02:25:50 Justice and wrath. Yes, the common lore and knowledge behind Vitaeo
Kaladin Shash 02:25:50 Silence.
Leopold Magnus 02:25:52 Uh, okay, so, yeah, I was gonna ask him, uh, so Ateo, uh, Ateo was the god of justice, right? And he's, he's been working justice and wrath. Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:26:09 a prime deity of the continent of Radovir. But Teo was once two beings, a half-orc named Va and a human named Teo. One was justice and one was wrath, but they, unknown to you guys, somehow got fused into the same being. So, sort of just like two gods in one, lots of history behind it.
Leopold Magnus 02:26:35 Okay. Um, and that would just be common knowledge or at least you would know. Okay. Uh, which one was the chaos and which one was the justice then? Okay. And that was wrath. Um, yeah, so
Dungeon Master 02:26:40 Yeah, that is common knowledge. Well, justice was VAH, V-A-H, the half-orc female, and the human male was Teo, T-E-Y-O. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:27:04 Um, so it seems if you're working with cultists, you must be more up, uh, Va's alley, rather than the justice... of... Mmm!
Dungeon Master 02:27:16 His whole demeanor kind of shifts as you sort of enter the dialogue, and he goes, I don't work with cultists. I send talent. To a group. That has made a deal with me. And. No, I worship, but.
Leopold Magnus 02:27:40 Ah, yes, yes, yes, oh, indeed. Huh. Okay, then. I mean, how do you feel about that? Not working with cultists, but working for cultists? I'm just, um, you know, these fellas were quite brutal. They did blow up an entire city block, and
Zariel Torgan 02:27:43 Think you can get beat up.
Dungeon Master 02:27:58 Sorry, do we have a problem? Yeah, again. I don't know who these people are. I don't know where they are. I don't know what they do. So as far as I'm concerned, I'm not part of this. As far as you're concerned.
Kaladin Shash 02:28:00 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:28:10 You know, we could take you in, considering you're conspiring with them. Isn't there something more you could tell us about this group? I'm going to do an insight check. OK.
Dungeon Master 02:28:28 OK, and then I'm not going to tell you why. But you're sort of really hitting a chord with him, so go ahead and give it with advantage. Anne.
Leopold Magnus 02:28:43 Well, ain't nothin' high.
Kaladin Shash 02:28:45 game. It doesn't matter what we ask the world.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:45 We're not learning shit from this guy.
Dungeon Master 02:28:53 As far as you can tell, the way you're speaking to him is really rubbing the wrong way. It's easy for you to forget that you are a giant suit of metal, and people in general don't really like talking to you. It sort of throws everything off. It's weird. It's not super common to have, like, automatons and droids and kind of deal talking so sentient yet.
Dungeon Master 02:29:18 So as far as you can tell, he's just sort of closing off to you. He seems hesitant to answer your questions. And he goes, I've told you what I think I'm going to tell you. And he sort of stops making direct eye contact. And he's like, unless there's something else I can help you officially for the Legionnaire, I think our conversation is done here.
Kaladin Shash 02:29:31 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:29:40 Okay, I suppose and Let's see is there like I guess where we at. We're just kind of like down in the pits Okay, ah
Dungeon Master 02:29:51 You are in a bar in like the far western section of the market district, just in some seedy tavern.
Leopold Magnus 02:30:04 I guess I can't. I was hoping the magical tinkering would allow me to make a device that maybe could record, but I don't think it can. So, um, that, that will be the, uh, end of my questioning. Um, and I'll kind of clock that he was a bit standoffish and, uh, slowly pass it along group that I don't necessarily trust him. And he might, might be hiding something about the cultists he works with.
Kaladin Shash 02:30:39 If they have no more questions to you, are we good to go?
Zariel Torgan 02:30:45 Yeah, I'd say he's been more than kind, considering the ordeal he's been through physically. I wish you have yourself a good day, and I would imagine we'd be seeing lots more of each other. Hopefully we can maintain a positive working relationship.
Dungeon Master 02:31:11 There he goes just again he goes, yeah, I don't know that I got your your names but uh, you all have yourself a nice time Cal Jim Grandpa Bob
Kaladin Shash 02:31:18 Told you, told you my name is, it's Cal.
Zariel Torgan 02:31:20 Tuberculosis, Jim.
Leopold Magnus 02:31:25 I'll spin my head around, and while walking away from him, I'll say, Cedric, make sure and hit me next time. Make it a fair fight. Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:31:40 He flips you the bird as he walks down the hallway. You see he takes a right into a room and disappears. Sort of sipping on his beer as he walks. He joins conversation with somebody as they walk in there. Leaves you three to yourself. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:31:58 This is still ultra-crowded though, the bar is absolutely full of people. This is not maybe the best place to discuss things.
Dungeon Master 02:32:04 Uh, like some people are filtering out, giving you a little more space just because the fights are done for the night. So like the main attraction is done. Uh, but the people who are there to drink are still there.
Leopold Magnus 02:32:22 Why, indeed, this is quite the filthy place. And I'm kind of, like, wiping right where, uh, Cedric... Didn't he pat me on the shoulder, or something like that? I thought he did- I thought he did- How about my hand? Yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah, where he was holding- holding my arm, I'm just gonna try and buff it out with a little cloth.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:28 me.
Dungeon Master 02:32:34 No, he didn't touch you. Oh, he held up your hand when, uh, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:32:37 Here.
Leopold Magnus 02:32:51 And Leopold's armor is in very good condition, very shiny. Keeps it nice and tight.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:58 Yeah, let's make their way out, make our way outside and discuss this a bit further. I would agree.
Kaladin Shash 02:33:05 I was going to say, yes, it's nighttime, right, Jonathan, in the game? Yeah. I could certainly use some rest after we talk. Do we just say we've just heard?
Dungeon Master 02:33:10 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:33:21 Yes, a moment in the corner wouldn't do me so poorly.
Kaladin Shash 02:33:32 Can we kind of slowly make our way back to the core, to where our barracks are, right? Wherever we would long rest, but can we talk on the way? Do we need to, we just want to make sure in the first little bit of our walking that we wouldn't be trailed. Can I sort of occasionally look for
Dungeon Master 02:33:40 Mhm. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, go ahead and give me a. What they give me just a perception check.
Kaladin Shash 02:34:01 Someone that would be like following us. Oh my goodness. That is unreal.
Zariel Torgan 02:34:15 Seeing him do that, could I also? Oh, well, it's a one. I don't know if you want me to do it now. I was gonna try to also do it, but since it's a one, I think that I look over and I see Kaladin looking around and he looks so confident. I'll just be like, I guess he's got it.
Dungeon Master 02:34:23 A lot of bad rolls. Yeah, you guys make your way back to the core, but you want to, you know, what conversation are you having?
Kaladin Shash 02:34:37 Yes, speak. Speak.
Zariel Torgan 02:34:43 I suppose we can talk freely then. I'm going to turn to Leo. Like, Leo, why were you antagonizing that poor beat up man so much?
Leopold Magnus 02:35:04 Well, um, I'm not quite sure he was quite beat up as you'd think. There's something very off with that man. Leopold extends his hand straight
Kaladin Shash 02:35:10 We've got more of them, all right.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:14 Hmm. Well, you know, when you point one finger, uh, you got four more pointing back at, well, three, cause the thumb kind of points a different way. Anyway, Leo. Yeah. More.
Leopold Magnus 02:35:32 and extends his index finger and then brushes the remaining four fingers and kind of rotates his hand up and looks at the fingers pointing back at him and he says, well, I suppose you're right. I guess there is three pointing back at me and then the thumb.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:49 Yeah, my thumb points in a weird way, so the metaphor isn't perfect, but I think the general idea is, you know, anyway. You might just be an automatonist.
Leopold Magnus 02:36:02 I do say, though, he was quite sensitive when I started insisting he worked with those cultists, which I think he does, to be honest with you. Leopold's just staring down at his hands, blankly, almost
Zariel Torgan 02:36:19 You know. Autophobic. Might be a robo, a robophobe. You might. Leo, are you, are you okay? Did, what has happened?
Kaladin Shash 02:36:23 Thank you. We're better than.
Leopold Magnus 02:36:31 stopped engaging anything and kind of starts moving his fingers little by little. Oh, yes, sorry. Yes, of course I am. Perfectly fine. Well, anyways, let's go on and find those cultists.
Zariel Torgan 02:36:58 What the fuck was that? Can I roll something to see what that was? Or try to see what that was? Would that be insight?
Leopold Magnus 02:37:07 I'm yeah, I mean, I guess it's not really hiding anything other than he was just kind of like glitched out staring his hands doing some self-reflection Yeah, I think you'd pick up on it because it's fairly obvious
Dungeon Master 02:37:08 Yeah. Yep.
Zariel Torgan 02:37:24 Alright, just to see what... I have not rolled above a sixth in the last, like, eight rolls.
Leopold Magnus 02:37:37 He's feeling insecure about being a robot because he feels human on the inside and doesn't understand why people would not see him as a person.
Kaladin Shash 02:37:53 move.
Zariel Torgan 02:37:54 Seeing the kind of dimming of the eyes as a telltale sign of the emotion, I'll just kind of reach out a hand, say, well, you still got us, Leo. And we'll all be there for you.
Dungeon Master 02:38:00 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 02:38:22 Well, yes, indeed. Yeah, and his eyes fire back up, and he kind of turns to the group and says, well, I don't know where I'd be without y'all a lot. Let's go and get another round. I guess we're knocking off for a long rest.
Kaladin Shash 02:38:43 Um, yeah, what do we want our moves to be though? What do we feel like we know from? We're just going to go wander around Don district. I picked that up. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:38:55 Who has the hand that he put down? Did somebody pick it up? Okay. I say we get some disguises and maybe, like, pick a face and buff him up with lots of charisma buffs. And then have a couple of us waiting in the wings, listening, and send a guy in with the hand and see what we can do. Maybe send all of us in. I don't know.
Leopold Magnus 02:39:01 I think, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:39:24 they normally get three different people that have, you know, I feel like a robot with a with a an emblem and blazed in the middle of the police might might might, you know. But. Yeah, so I think. Yeah. Hello, fellow people.
Leopold Magnus 02:39:35 The Legionnaires. Yeah. Robocop bot. Yeah, we could send one of you guys in, boost you up. I mean, but do we even know where to go? Okay.
Kaladin Shash 02:39:36 Yeah, I'd be a little too much. Not not yet. We just have a district that we need to go to and we know that they're meeting in the basement.
Zariel Torgan 02:39:55 I think so. Yeah. Yeah, just rough idea. Yeah, let's do it. Jonathan.
Leopold Magnus 02:40:05 We have an idea then, yeah. So just long rests and then get somebody out there, try to get them to join the cultists.
Kaladin Shash 02:40:06 The chapel in the basement. Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:24 Do we know whether or not it would be possible at all to get, like, one of the cultists that we killed robes from, like, an evidence locker or something? Hmm? Oh, okay. Gotcha. Okay, okay, alright.
Dungeon Master 02:40:36 You can probably do that. They're not like I meant like they're just very basic. Cloth material roads. But I like actual sack.
Kaladin Shash 02:40:37 There's a burlap fact, right? Yeah. Yeah, we can. We can make something happen.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:55 Do we want to check in with our handler rat shit? Maybe just with what we've got so far, we could get a little bit of an advance and take a spin on that Deagley Bob.
Kaladin Shash 02:41:08 I think we might try that out.
Leopold Magnus 02:41:08 Also, I was going to say, for the record, it is rat shit, because the translating and summary has been getting that wrong. So hopefully, it'll fix that one.
Dungeon Master 02:41:25 Yes. Rat Shit. You should stop right now. I thought you were gonna damage everything. Rat Shit's real name is Donnie Farsight, if you remember. No, his name is Donnie.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:26 Oh, if you say like, hey, any of the previous mentions of this phrase is actually this phrase, do you think that I could like change my name? Oh, I thought it was like Big Dick Rick or something. If I say that,
Kaladin Shash 02:41:42 You You
Leopold Magnus 02:41:48 She Johnny You
Zariel Torgan 02:41:55 I feel like if I say that, the AI will pick it up and be like, uh, they determined that a real name was actually...
Dungeon Master 02:42:03 If you do that to my current being a character to play, I'm gonna start calling you small dick the whole rest of the campaign. Yeah, we get way too meta about it. It's like the group bickering about what to call each other.
Leopold Magnus 02:42:12 You know, what's great is it's probably smart enough to pick that up and we'll mention it, but it will not, like, you know, incorporate it in.
Kaladin Shash 02:42:21 Yes. Let us let us let us speak the red shit. I think that's fine so we can long rest talk to ratchet. Figure out a few things.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:27 That's funny. All right, I'll let it be. I would agree. I would agree. Let's make our way. Make our way downtown.
Leopold Magnus 02:42:42 Why indeed? Play some cards or something?
Dungeon Master 02:42:50 Okay, you guys make your way back to the core, head straight to bed. Anything you guys want to do as you prep and get ready and sort of hang out before the end of the day, you guys just going right to bed.
Kaladin Shash 02:43:05 I got absolutely. You have to write him. Debbie, you also.
Zariel Torgan 02:43:05 We could see if Rhett shits up. Yeah, I'll play some cards with you, Leo.
Leopold Magnus 02:43:19 OK, yeah, are we going to play all night? Because I think I, if possible, would like to work on, I guess, how you copy a spell. Is that how that works? You have to, OK, you find a scroll, then you copy it. OK. Oh, OK.
Dungeon Master 02:43:31 Yeah, and it costs like a certain amount of gold to copy over.
Kaladin Shash 02:43:34 Yep, you copy it either out of another book or out of a scroll. Costs 50 gold and so many hours per level. So it's 50 gold per level and two hours per level. If you have proficiency in it, if you have proficiency in that school of magic, everything's reduced by 50%.
Leopold Magnus 02:43:51 Oh, okay. I see. Okay. So I would be able to get, uh, at least a level one spell learned. Assuming I had access to the book. Yeah. In two hours. Yeah. Okay. Um, I don't know. Uh, I think, well, does that include cantrips then? Cause that would just be a,
Kaladin Shash 02:44:04 Yeah, two hours. Yeah, two hours. Yeah. No, your can, well, depends again. There is a wizard trait that allows you to rewrite one can trip a day, but not normally.
Dungeon Master 02:44:06 In two hours, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:44:29 Oh, interesting. Okay. Okay.
Kaladin Shash 02:44:38 You can. I don't know if you can. I don't know if you can even trade yours out. You could potentially look. You could potentially look inside. Jonathan are for just. Canon sake the. My spell book is a digital version on my. My forearm we've seen these like Rift Van brazier that are. Flapping over making.
Dungeon Master 02:45:04 Mm-hmm. Yeah, you haven't super talked about how yours manifests yet, but yeah, it can just be like a wrist plate that sort of projects out the runes you need for each spell as you need it.
Kaladin Shash 02:45:18 OK. That being my spellbook, would Leopold be able to potentially copy something from my device into his book? Oh, then yeah. Own spells. OK, not vice versa.
Dungeon Master 02:45:34 I believe traditionally copying a spell consumes it, and a wizard can copy their own spellbook, but I think you just have to give him your spellbook if you want him to use it. Classically, I think of Critical Role as my example. They just have to use the other wizard's spellbook. But yeah, when you copy a spell, it consumes it once you're finished.
Kaladin Shash 02:45:50 Yeah, no. Yeah. OK, OK, I gotcha. We can.
Leopold Magnus 02:46:05 Uh, Jonathan, was there a library with, you know, spells? I mean, uh, the core has a number of wizards. There's gotta be some resources there to like, you know, check out a spell book or use it up or what have you.
Dungeon Master 02:46:21 Yeah, I don't want to get too liberal with something like that because I'm not going to give you an in-game method of having unlimited spells at your disposal. But you are welcome to go check the library to see if you can find any spells.
Kaladin Shash 02:46:30 the library.
Leopold Magnus 02:46:38 Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'll, uh, I'll do an investigation check. I'm going to look for a librarian to assist me, uh, if possible. And I'm going to look for a charm person spell book. That's a level one spell.
Dungeon Master 02:46:57 And what level is chum person? OK. Yeah, as you make your way to the library. You go ahead and you same deal where you have to sort of be escorted around by one of like the library scribes who sort of oversee everything in the archives.
Dungeon Master 02:47:26 And as you walk in, there's just like a live, timid, sort of shaky type. We'll call him. Oh, geez, what do I want him to name? His name will be. Yeah, let me just go to my list.
Dungeon Master 02:47:53 I was going to make something up, but I've got a full list. His name is Victor Holloway.
Kaladin Shash 02:48:02 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:48:03 Mm.
Leopold Magnus 02:48:04 That's funny.
Dungeon Master 02:48:11 He's got, as normal, fashion for the scribes, shaved head. He's a little gaunt because he does an ovary. He lives a very modest lifestyle, dedicating everything to the study of books. And he just goes, how can they help you today?
Leopold Magnus 02:48:32 Oh, yes. See, I'm looking for something that would up my charisma a little bit. I find myself not very likable, so, you know, maybe something to kind of grease the wheels of dialogue, if you know what I mean.
Dungeon Master 02:48:51 He gives you an immediate sort of skeptical look and you see him sort of glance side to side and he leans in and he goes, you do know this is a library and it's not a shop so to speak? I don't sell pendants here.
Leopold Magnus 02:49:13 Oh, yes, of course. Well, see, I'm looking for something of the magical nature. Do you have any spells that could help me?
Dungeon Master 02:49:24 Spells. He does think. Yes, I can show you what limited spells we have.
Dungeon Master 02:49:33 and he takes you to the same place that Kaladin had been taken before. It's like up a set of stairs. The tomes and stuff on this level are all, like, arcanically locked to, like, the actual shelves. They're attached with, like, an ethereal chain that keeps them from being stolen, so that you can't, like, take spells out and consume them, but, like, you could begin the process of, like, transcribing the runes over. I'll say, since, um...
Dungeon Master 02:50:02 They have it intended not to consume them, but you do have the intention of learning it. I will just double the time and say, like, it would take you a couple times to sort of learn a spell from scratch using the library version. It won't consume more of the gold, but it'll just take double the time. Four hours, but still just baseline gold value, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:50:13 It's cool. It's cool. It's cool.
Leopold Magnus 02:50:17 All right. OK, cool. So four hours then, instead of two, to pick that spell up. Got it. OK. Well, I guess I might not play cards with you, Zariel, unless we're going to stay up and play. I don't know what time of day this is.
Dungeon Master 02:50:36 But same rules, because it would have made sense that you would have talked to Kaladin about it. They do have the ability to put the book on hold for you, so you could just come back and you wouldn't need to be showed to it or something. You could just come in and study it whenever you needed to.
Leopold Magnus 02:50:57 Excellent. OK, that's good to know. Well, that's good. Leopold doesn't really sleep anyways, and he certainly enjoys his intellectual pursuit. So go to the library and we'll spend
Zariel Torgan 02:51:00 Nah, that's alright, Leo. You get your priorities done. I'll catch some shut-eye.
Kaladin Shash 02:51:06 You can say, I would go straight to bed. I'm so beat up.
Dungeon Master 02:51:06 All right. If you spend four hours, I'm going to say you're delayed in waking up.
Leopold Magnus 02:51:26 four hours recording that spell. Okay, sounds good.
Dungeon Master 02:51:34 with the group uh in like the first couple hours so if they do something right away you'll just you'll miss like the small talk kind of deal unless unless they get up and start a fight right away you won't be you won't be missing anything important okay uh kaladin's going right to bed uh does ariel want to do anything
Kaladin Shash 02:51:50 Take one rest.
Zariel Torgan 02:51:58 No, I'm in a similar boat. I'm down decently low and used a lot of spells, so I'll just make my preparations, water my few little plants and flowers that I moved over to the barracks, and just kinda relax, do a little bit of yoga, go to bed. I took a combined probably 120 damage, but
Dungeon Master 02:52:15 Did Zariel take a lot of hits in that fight? Yeah, as Zariel is watering these plants, give me a perception check.
Kaladin Shash 02:52:21 Got stunned. He went through two forms, yeah. Cool. OK, OK, OK, he notices.
Leopold Magnus 02:52:28 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 02:52:29 Yeah. Well, I haven't rolled above a 10. OK, that's better. 24.
Dungeon Master 02:52:46 Sorry, you're watering these plants and just absentmindedly going over everything in the day. Maybe you're planning your next day, uh, not super paying a whole lot of attention except for like the amount that you're watering. But you see a glint of like yellow Amber fluid at like your knuckle that you're not sure how it totally got there.
Zariel Torgan 02:53:14 I'll reach out and I'll just give a little dab up with my pointer on my left hand and just kind of move it between my thumb and forefinger. Give it a little sniff. I'll look up at the ceiling.
Dungeon Master 02:53:28 It's viscous. It's very slick between your fingers. Smells mechanical, clean. Best way to describe it is it smells like a lubricant.
Kaladin Shash 02:53:49 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:53:49 Hmm. Look up at the ceiling, just kinda... look around a little bit. Do I see anything on the ceiling? Hmm. Alright. I'll just clock that, and just kinda... keep moving about my day. I'll just wipe it off and I'll put it on a little slide. Well, I wouldn't have that. I'll stick it on a napkin.
Dungeon Master 02:53:56 Don't see anything up there. No.
Zariel Torgan 02:54:19 And then I'll put it in my drawer for later viewing. And then I'll go to bed. Rollies.
Kaladin Shash 02:54:23 16.
Dungeon Master 02:54:27 Alrighty. Great. Zario and Kaladin, both you roll me a d20. You're doing rollies against each other. Five.
Leopold Magnus 02:54:46 BYE!
Zariel Torgan 02:54:53 BAAAAM
Dungeon Master 02:54:58 So, Ariel, you're kind of fitful getting to sleep, but sleep does find you. Restlessly, you're not much of a dreamer in general. Sometimes flashes of before your accident come to your head. You're in your dream thinking of all the days that you can remember, and you don't remember feeling like you recovered from an injury.
Dungeon Master 02:55:29 You don't ever remember having bandages around your head. You just sort of remember existing at a point, like everything just came back to you and you're thinking about it and you're almost removed from your own mind. You're sort of watching your thoughts process and then you have a flash of a memory of same thing you saw before. You're on this table looking up at a bright light. You hear like some noise in the background, almost like, uh,
Dungeon Master 02:55:59 on like a lie detector, a litmus test, where you can hear the sort of scribe going up and down, reading your pulse, just up and down over and over again, as you're sort of like groggily and hazy in there. And the same thing repeats. You hear somebody sort of lean and goes, this one's awake, put him out. And then it fades to dark. And as it continues to fade,
Dungeon Master 02:56:26 You hear like one more thing. It's so distant as your mind sort of escapes into the base of your neck. It leaves your brain. You stop thinking. You just hear inform. You hear blank, blank, blank. Don't catch it. Council member. Project is underway. And then nothing.
Dungeon Master 02:56:54 And then you complete your long rest. Kaladin, you are sleeping and very opposite of Zariel. You are a vivid dreamer. Always have been. You have wild dreams, revelations of what you've always assumed to be the Feywild. You've always accredited your Fey ancestry to it.
Zariel Torgan 02:56:58 Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:57:21 You obviously have a strong bloodline and connection to the elves with your general appearance. But lately, your dreams have been an otherworldly next level. You see light rays shining down, cut off by trees out of your scope of vision. You just see the beams of light brushing through the grass. You see yourself in that first person view. You can see your hands sort of swiping through the tall grass that comes about to your waist.
Kaladin Shash 02:57:36 you.
Dungeon Master 02:57:50 Your movements feel light. No stress in the moment. You're moving through. You're running, and you see a figure in the distance. From here, it almost seems like that woman you always see, the one very similar to the mysterious girl in the medic lab right now. In the same fashion of the dream, you're running towards her, but different this time. You're running forward, and you step on something. You hear a crack underneath your foot.
Dungeon Master 02:58:18 you look down and you've stepped on like a perfectly clean and old skull and it's crushed under the weight of your foot, leaving just like the maxilla and the mandible and part of the front of the like the nose, that portion of the frontal bone just sitting there. And next to your boot is it's crushed and you take a step back and you step back onto another bone, probably a humerus, it snaps in the center. And you look down, you look up and you're no longer in a field you're in.
Dungeon Master 02:58:48 this dark pit, surrounded by bone on the ground, all around your surroundings in the pit. It's not walls, but almost looks like a dark sheer cloth, just lightly ruffling, but you don't see anything behind it. It's like it is both the wall and just a hanging tapestry at the same time.
Dungeon Master 02:59:09 And beyond that, beyond any scope of vision, any of your senses beyond hearing, you find yourself stuck in this moment and you hear the voice just say, let me out. And as the voice raises, you come to and it's the morning. You've got a little bit of a sweat, but otherwise you've gained the benefits of your long rest.
Kaladin Shash 02:59:19 Okay. Okay, that's creepy. I'm assuming from my own previous experience in my dream, did that voice
Kaladin Shash 02:59:49 correlate with that character that creature i saw in my other dream let me out okay okay all right long rest
Dungeon Master 02:59:54 Very similar. And then, Leopold, eventually you found your way to bed. I would say, as you made your way and you're sort of walking through the bunks at like midnight, one o'clock in the morning, most people are asleep. You see some people have like an arcane lamp and they're reading just a book at their bed.
Dungeon Master 03:00:22 You get a couple of, like, nods and, you know, oh, night to you, and they shut it off and that kind of deal. You do see in his sleep, Kaladin is turning a little bit. Zariel is perfectly still at this point, but you see a little bit of tossing and turning before you sort of go into your sentry mode for the night. And then it is the morning.
Dungeon Master 03:01:07 Oh, and yeah, Leopold, if you stayed up the whole night, you do learn Charm Person. That is part of your strengths.
Leopold Magnus 03:01:09 Okay. Excellent.
Zariel Torgan 03:01:09 Well, I guess I'll get up and see Kaladin, probably about getting up about this time. Not feeling super rested, I figure maybe him and I can go talk to Ratchet while Leo sleeps in a little bit. Well, Kaladin, what do you say you wanna...
Zariel Torgan 03:01:47 Well uh, Kaladin, you wanna go talk to Ratchet and tell him where we're at? Before we head out, I'd like to go over to Leo's body.
Kaladin Shash 03:01:52 Yes, let us go talk to him. Yes, we'll let him know what we know and if he's got better advice for us.
Zariel Torgan 03:02:07 and just like try to find a joint that's exposed and just try to get a little sample and see if I can get a little bit of grease off of him just to compare it to what was rubbed on me or what was was there just to just for you know if there's something readily available if not then I'm not going to like wrench him apart or anything ooh
Kaladin Shash 03:02:27 Wow.
Dungeon Master 03:02:28 Give me. Give me a slight a hand check. I was gonna say. Not a surprise, it was just to see if he sort of bypasses your passive sentry. I was gonna just do half.
Zariel Torgan 03:02:39 God damn. Natural one. I reach out.
Leopold Magnus 03:02:44 I also have a sentry mode, so I don't think I can be, like, surprised. Got it.
Dungeon Master 03:02:56 of your passive, so he only had to beat a 5. Zorro, you sort of dab that cloth into one of the joints, just inside of, we'll say, where his chest plate meets the hip plating of his pelvic guard. You sort of go right into there and get a dab, and it wakes him up.
Kaladin Shash 03:03:00 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:03:20 But before you have a chance to really analyze it, Leopold, do you see the, like, Sariel is, like, reaching into your, like, stomach real quick?
Leopold Magnus 03:03:31 Yeah, so I guess the suit of armor sentry mode is definitely what wakes Leo up. It kind of rings out, alert, alert, and awakens Leo. And right in front of him is Zariel looking awfully suspicious. And I go, Zariel, what on earth are you doing?
Zariel Torgan 03:03:52 Howdy. I didn't want to disturb you, Leo. I apologize. I had a weird liquid on me, and it was after our fight, and I know things got pretty crazy, but I just wanted to see if it was from you.
Zariel Torgan 03:04:15 Sorry if I made you uncomfortable. In my mind's eye, when I thought about doing this, I wasn't reaching for your pelvic area, I was going for like an elbow or something, but, you know, these things happen. Yeah, I'm just, I'm still rummaging around in your guts while I'm talking. Oh, jeez.
Leopold Magnus 03:04:27 I'm just staring down on you while you're in there, trying to grab around. Leave me be, Zariel. If you had such concerns, you could have come straight to me. I don't mind. Now let me see this strange liquid of yours.
Kaladin Shash 03:04:28 Oh.
Zariel Torgan 03:04:48 I did come straight to you. I came right up to you. Are we talking about the same thing? I'm sorry. Yeah, I'll go get the napkin and I'll bring it over.
Kaladin Shash 03:05:00 It's applicable.
Dungeon Master 03:05:11 Leopold Zario brings you a cloth napkin with what appears to be an oil-stained portion of it.
Leopold Magnus 03:05:22 OK. Can I take a zoomed in look here, do an investigation, and see if it matches any kind of fluid or whatever I would contain in my suit of armor?
Dungeon Master 03:05:34 Yeah I mean as as part of like your artifice in class you have the ability to create any tool you need for any job. So you guys like see Leopold sort of looks around even just waking up and he like pulls a cup off of one person's desk. He pulls like somebody's alchemy book out and like just starts gathering all these random things and then he like throws the cloth into like a distiller and he boils it and then he like takes a drop of his own lubricant and stuff and compares it and
Dungeon Master 03:06:02 Through your testing, Leopold, Zario has fully just handed you what you would assume, because you don't know any better given no context, is a cloth, at least partially not soaked, because he only had a drop of it that he found, of what looks like gear lubricant.
Leopold Magnus 03:06:27 And I wouldn't have been able to say where that came from. Right. Where that came from, right. But it is similar or matches mine. Got it. OK.
Kaladin Shash 03:06:28 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 03:06:33 No, I'd say no amount of science or chemistry is going to tell you where the lubricant came. It is, yeah, chemically compounded, this is like a petroleum-based lubricant.
Leopold Magnus 03:06:53 Yeah, so I come back to Zariel after kind of whipping that up, and indeed, it is lubricant, maybe of something mechanical. It's hard to say if it came from me, though.
Zariel Torgan 03:07:07 I'm gonna give him like a little side-eye. You really think that there's any chance it's from some other thing? We don't have a lot of lubricated things running around, but...
Leopold Magnus 03:07:22 Oh, I suppose. Yes, yes, I guess it had to have come from me. I just would think that my gears were a little bit more sturdy and wouldn't spray oil while I was moving around. Indeed, that is true. This very well could be my oil.
Zariel Torgan 03:07:36 Well, to be fair, you were self-sabotaging a little so that you could look real funky. I remember you broke your leg off and you were waddling. Yes. All right, well, I'm sorry for sneaking up on you, I wasn't
Dungeon Master 03:07:51 Indeed. It's like almost very George Takei of you.
Kaladin Shash 03:07:58 A little bit.
Zariel Torgan 03:08:07 Wasn't trying to be weird. I just wanted to get a little bit of answers. Hey, why don't you, why don't you get another little bit of sleep and then that way you get your rest and, uh, Callie and I'll go talk to old rat shit. That is true. All right. Thanks, bud. All right. Get some sleep.
Leopold Magnus 03:08:12 Well... Oh, yes, certainly, Zario. And don't bother about being weird. You're always weird.
Dungeon Master 03:08:37 OK. I think this is a pretty good stopping point for the night. Got it written down where you guys are heading, so just pick up right from there.
Zariel Torgan 03:08:41 I mean, I'll go, uh, catch up with Kaladin. Alright. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 03:08:53 Awesome. Hey Jonathan, can I can I get a trip over to? Ham hock at the beginning of the next session or like just like an upgrade? Yeah. Awesome.
Leopold Magnus 03:09:02 Yeah, excellent. Cool, yeah, I'd like to go see a ham hock as well.
Dungeon Master 03:09:05 Fun stuff, guys. Nicely done. Good fight. Yeah. Writing it down so I don't forget.
Kaladin Shash 03:09:35 All right, man, said Rick.
Leopold Magnus 03:09:39 Oh, yeah.

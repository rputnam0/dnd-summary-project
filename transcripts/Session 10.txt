Zariel Torgan 00:00:02 That was rat shit.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:04 All right. Yep, that was from Kaladin, right? Ratchet, got it. Yep, got it.
Kaladin Shash 00:00:16 A couple of things. We still have Bless Up, correct? That's still active? No, that was just from, uh... That was Rat Hit, yeah. We're actually gonna cast that one up. Actually, I need to join the VTT real quick. I was just on Discord.
Dungeon Master 00:00:21 It is correct. Some ratchet.
Dungeon Master 00:00:41 I mean, yeah, at this point, so the fight is mid throw of it. Leopold hiding behind this lit fire brazier that's burning with a low light currently. Zariel at the top of the stairs near this like weirdly floating broken glass stained glass like
Dungeon Master 00:01:02 Picture this artwork piece that was interrupted when the sword broke through it. He's just at the very top of there. The Reverend, approximately 30 feet in the air, has been floating towards you guys and almost to the center of the room. Ratchet is currently going to be double teamed by two of these sort of lesser divine beings. Kaladin is a little bit ahead. And we're picking up with it being Kaladin's turn.
Kaladin Shash 00:01:29 Good, I think I would get on the comms because I in the previous round I had received broken messaging, correct? Or around or two. Yeah. Captain Levi's already retreating to the core as well, correct? That happened a few rounds ago. Right, yeah, perfect.
Dungeon Master 00:01:47 He himself is leaving his men to go beeline it towards the core. Yes.
Kaladin Shash 00:01:54 Um, I think I would get on comms. Do I have direct communication with captain Levi? Because our teams were proximity. Okay. I was going to say, otherwise I'll just talk to the court. All right. So I think the first little part of this act, uh, turn would be to communicate quickly and just say, kept to Levi. I need you to go immediately to the med bay. You need to get back to the court. They.
Kaladin Shash 00:02:23 I don't want to say imposter. The attackers are there now. The girl with the mask needs to be protected. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:02:36 You hear he sort of chimes in real quick. You hear like the wind blowing through sort of muting him as he goes, you don't think I fucking know that? I'm on my way. I wasn't close. It's going to take me a little bit. Why would they want this girl? And that'll be sort of the end of his dialogue during their turn for you to think about. What's your next move?
Kaladin Shash 00:02:56 That's okay. Okay. All right. Um, we, we haven't even touched this main dude now that turned into this, whatever giant angel fighter. God. Okay. All right. I'm going to, and we're in ratchet.
Leopold Magnus 00:03:11 I think I may have hit him with a stone. Maybe that was the father though, I don't remember.
Dungeon Master 00:03:20 Uh, he's he's taking it. I've got him down. He is 30 feet in the air too. Yeah, you know, it's purposefully scary.
Kaladin Shash 00:03:23 Okay, right right shits right after me. Okay, good. I'm gonna let him do his thing. I'm gonna i'm gonna try to attempt to make some sort of Attack on this thing it is I think too far away. Yep. It's outside of my movement range Okay, so he's really like 45 feet away from me Okay, so he's flying I forgot that that's fine, um
Dungeon Master 00:04:05 Let me try. Hold on. Yeah. Yeah, you could hit.
Kaladin Shash 00:04:07 That's fine, I think I'm just going to fire bolt towards him and I'll use all my movement. To move to the left, supposed to be a ticket here comes. That's not going to hit. Just flies absolutely wide of him. It no way, no way.
Dungeon Master 00:04:34 That's fine. Okay. Up next will be Donnie Ratchet Farsight, your cleric companion. How far is he? He's 105-ish feet from...
Kaladin Shash 00:04:37 That's it. That's movement action. I got to go in a second.
Dungeon Master 00:05:04 Sorry all so Let's see what he can do Since they do know each other Jesse would Rat should understand that you do have some ability to heal yourself as well
Zariel Torgan 00:05:33 Yeah, I think it'd be fair to say that when I asked him what he did, that I could have told him what I did.
Dungeon Master 00:05:44 OK. He has 30 feet of movement, so he will go 30. He will take an attack of opportunity that we will deal with in a second. He'll use his action to dash. That puts him there. And then you are 45 feet now. Perfect. Since he movement action, he's got a bonus action.
Dungeon Master 00:06:13 A third level healing word, you, which is a d4 plus spell cast modifier. You know I'm in maxed him, so he's got a plus five, and he's casting it third, so it'll be 3d4.
Zariel Torgan 00:06:17 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:06:44 Oh, low, average. You heal 11 points. But then... He will...
Zariel Torgan 00:06:48 All right. A.
Dungeon Master 00:07:09 After Ratchet's turn, the Reverend will turn and see that he brought you up, and he'll shoot a Guiding Bolt at Ratchet. It's a natural 19 for a 27.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:38 Jesus.
Kaladin Shash 00:07:38 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:07:46 Matcha takes 13 points of damage. Okay. Oh, and then it's his turn. Perfect. I have to pull up his character sheet. I was actually much closer than I thought. I'll update his health in a second. On his actual turn, he will...
Dungeon Master 00:08:14 You're out of reach. Ratchet's right there. Who wants to roll me a d4 for who he goes for? He's going for Ratchet.
Kaladin Shash 00:08:33 I'll roll it. Three. It's going for three. Die, Ratchet. That's our healer.
Leopold Magnus 00:08:34 All right Donnie ratchets not gonna make it not on my watch This music is great
Zariel Torgan 00:08:38 Hmm. I want his name. Not with a name like that.
Dungeon Master 00:08:45 Yeah, he's not gonna, I don't think he's gonna survive this. Oh, I rolled a nat one! First attack misses? Oh!
Kaladin Shash 00:09:05 Whoa. That's great. Not going to.
Dungeon Master 00:09:14 Natural 3 plus 5 is 8. He misses both attacks.
Leopold Magnus 00:09:26 How does this look, Jonathan?
Zariel Torgan 00:09:28 Ha ha ha ha ha
Dungeon Master 00:09:32 um he flies down at almost two blinding of speed ratchet as his name uh was with his name was originally described as a very lithe and sort of scrawny looking person of half-orc descent he's tall he's sort of he's like he's gangly so as the sword with like
Dungeon Master 00:09:52 beaming with this radiant energy comes striking down he sort of just back steps at first not intentionally he had just gone to heal and maybe tripped a little bit and just misses the blade it hits the ground and explodes and it throws him backwards out of range of the second attack as he sort of falls and rolls to his feet um pretty much surviving by luck um and that is going to be the end of his turn uh
Dungeon Master 00:10:22 Up at the top, we have Layer Action 20. Somebody roll me a d4. Three. Three is... Oh, this is the one you guys got last time. Divine Reinforcement. Heals the Reverend and two of his allies for 2d8 hit points.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:30 I can roll this one. Re. Jesus Christ.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:39 They're going to be stronger than when they showed up.
Kaladin Shash 00:10:51 because you're going to be at full charge.
Dungeon Master 00:10:52 That's kind of the worst one to get. That's what happened the first time, too. He does look like, oh, 6 and 7, Jesus. He looks like he's taken less damage than he has. He healed 2d8 before already.
Leopold Magnus 00:11:08 I don't know about you guys, but the Reverend sure looks like he's juicing. Are his veins, like, popping? Like, is there any, uh, any apparent... Okay. I got it. So he looks formidable, but maybe not.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:14 Speaking of
Dungeon Master 00:11:22 Not yet. He hasn't hit the upper limit yet. He's taken enough damage. I think you guys forget that you did focus on him. You were hitting him with the magic stone a couple times. He's looking very healthy now, but he's not overflowing with energy. Leopold, it is your turn. Go ahead.
Leopold Magnus 00:11:40 I see. I remember seeing these guys when I was in Mexico, man, I think I blocked that out.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:44 Juicing I gotta put I gotta put some messages in the chat when I was in Mexico their pharmacies had steroids And so I just put two pictures in the chat, this is like a pharmacy that's on like every street corner You
Kaladin Shash 00:11:52 Yeah. I love that it just cracks me up.
Dungeon Master 00:12:09 Oh, when I was in Mexico, it was just people offering you Coke for a good time, you know, on the beach constantly.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:17 Yeah. Yeah. I got lots of offers for Coke, but I, uh, get your anabolics here. Oh man. Yeah. Yeah. It's shredded. Oh man.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:18 Viagra, HGH. Yeah, dude, the referee is looking like one of these guys. That's what I was actually kind of wondering. I was like, is he looking like one of these dudes? So I feel like if he got powered up, he'd look kind of like he was. Yeah. That's great. All right.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:45 Yeah, I think Leopold would yell out to Ratchet, you got it, Dottie! You're doing great out there! Kind of peeking behind this partial cover of the fire pit. Kind of timidly peeking out as the Reverend is striking furiously at Ratchet.
Kaladin Shash 00:12:45 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:52 He's just dripping blood.
Leopold Magnus 00:13:06 But with my action, I will actually call forth my Steel Defender. And so I think as Leopold is yelling to Ratchet, the armor-sensing Intimate Danger kicks into full gear and the Steel Defender peels away from the back of Leopold's suit. And do I have a token for that?
Zariel Torgan 00:13:32 Thought so. Yeah, is it in your extras?
Dungeon Master 00:13:33 No, we should honestly make one, though. Like, just a custom one. Well, we haven't had it yet.
Leopold Magnus 00:13:36 I was going to say, I thought I had a little character sheet for that. I can never remember how to get to it, though. Yeah, I thought so. See, it's come into play maybe once. It's been a long time, though. Jeez, man, you really got to get into the weeds here.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:08 Sorry, I was going to say I can't find that action. So I don't I don't even know where the stat block for that steel. Oh, here it is. Yes, steel defender. OK, well, I have a stat block, but I don't I can send it to game longer, I guess.
Dungeon Master 00:14:08 I'm going to make one for you. What is yours like again? What does it look like?
Leopold Magnus 00:14:35 Yeah, so it essentially emerges from Leopold's suit. So you can almost imagine some of the gears peeling away and the back paneling of his suit where the words bone crusher are written come with it and a softer kind of temporary armor hovers Leopold's backside. The steel defender emerges from the suit, springs up
Leopold Magnus 00:15:04 into a surprisingly dexterous form for being entirely constructed of steel whirling gears. It takes roughly the same profile of Leopold, so fairly tall and imposing, but it's much, much thinner. Its legs almost chicken-like.
Dungeon Master 00:15:16 I mean, what is it shaped like? What's it based on?
Zariel Torgan 00:15:23 Huh?
Leopold Magnus 00:15:35 The suit of armor comes down to maybe mid-thigh, where it almost looks like a short skirt, but it is a heavy suit of armor. Eyes glowing, interestingly, a little different than Leopold's. They glow a deep blue. But yeah, where is his...
Dungeon Master 00:15:56 Nice. Okay, do some in yours.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:57 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 00:16:05 It has dark vision, so that's interesting. I don't think I have dark vision. I can't figure out what the Steel Defender range would be, because I was hoping to run towards the fight here.
Kaladin Shash 00:16:31 40 feet, how far you can place it.
Leopold Magnus 00:16:33 Well, oh yeah, okay, 40 feet. Yeah, yeah, 40 feet, that's right. Okay, so 10 feet more than me, that's hopeful to remember. So I can make it, it looks like to about here. Would that put me then, what would that be?
Dungeon Master 00:16:34 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:17:14 With that what you. 5 feet. Remember, he's he's still in the air a bit. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:15 What's the standard melee range, is it 10 feet? 5 feet. Oh, okay. Yeah, so I think the Defender is out of reach for the Reverend. So yeah, for my action I'll call him forth, and I will command him to attack the Reverend as my action, and then as a bonus action I will cast
Zariel Torgan 00:17:20 Bye feet.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:44 God, I don't remember, but I thought I had recently called Magic Stone up. I may have used one. Okay, all right, thank you for the reminder. So then I have two I will use as a bonus action Magic Stone.
Dungeon Master 00:17:49 Yeah, you have refreshed it and you've used one of the new sets. OK. And your artificer has hit points equal to two plus your intelligence modder modifier plus five times your artificial artificer level, so. It's going to be two plus. Your intelligence modifier is four or five.
Kaladin Shash 00:17:52 you.
Leopold Magnus 00:18:18 Four, just for my, yeah, plus intelligence, yeah, four, four. Three levels of artificer, so three.
Dungeon Master 00:18:21 And then what is your artificer it's all four and right all four Okay, so it'll be plus 15 Did it add it no it didn't I thought it was gonna make it easy for me you he he's got 21 HP
Leopold Magnus 00:18:46 21 HP. Okay. And you said that's artificer level plus intelligence modifier plus what? Oh, interesting. Okay. Right. And I can repair it three times per day.
Dungeon Master 00:18:52 It's 2 plus your intelligence modifier plus 5 times your artificer level. And if he goes to repair itself, like similar to hit dice, it has d8s because your hit dice are hit d8s. Mhm.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:15 Oh, this is a lot to keep track of. OK, I'll do my best. I'm sorry for stumbling. Yeah. Yeah, right, well, then there's that. This is like a whole nother character I have to play. Yeah, 15. That's average.
Kaladin Shash 00:19:18 No, it's alright, man. I've never, I've never done artistry. 15. 15. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:19 Heheheheheheheheh
Dungeon Master 00:19:21 That's okay. I made a token. He's got, what's his AC supposed to be? His AC is 15. Okay, so the little token there has about everything. Does he move on your combat initiative?
Leopold Magnus 00:19:46 Uh, yeah, I think it's either right after me, kind of like, you know, companion. Yeah, I just have. Man, where is it say?
Dungeon Master 00:19:52 We'll put him at 17 then to throw him right after you. He's got to be 18 then, we'll see.
Kaladin Shash 00:20:12 Would you say what? So three, it's just. Yeah, that looks like. The hit dice is just how many you get to use per day, or is that what you're saying? It might be three times a day.
Leopold Magnus 00:20:14 Trying to figure out the specifics because I can find on my character sheet, the steel defender, but I can't find where it says like once per day or whatever it is you can. Feels like it misses information. What's that? Yeah, I think the.
Dungeon Master 00:20:26 It'll be in your features and traits, probably. Repair three times a day, the magical mechanism inside the Defender Restore, 2d8 plus your proficiency bonus to the self or the construct within five feet of it. So he has hit dice equal to,
Leopold Magnus 00:20:48 Yeah. Yeah, it's... I'll try and keep tracking that.
Kaladin Shash 00:20:56 level.
Dungeon Master 00:20:56 um your artificer level so he has 3d8 so he can only heal 2d8 so he can only do it once at this point like if you leveled up again he'd have two repairs you could do technically
Leopold Magnus 00:21:15 But anyway, it's long the short of it. I'm calling in steel defender chicken legs with a short thigh armor, heavy plate all the way up to the head. Ice glowing blue stands ready and Leopold casts one of his magic stones. Yeah. But imagine that, like from the knee down, it's just kind of like wiry, like metal.
Dungeon Master 00:21:30 This is what I found. There's only so much I can Google search in a short time. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:33 Nice. I'm not done yet.
Leopold Magnus 00:21:47 Yeah, yeah, yeah. But just so you guys get the full picture. That's exactly what I was thinking, yeah. Okay, to the Reverend, 25 to hit. All right, stone zings across my shoulder, striking the Reverend. I have one more stone remaining.
Dungeon Master 00:22:03 Definitely hits. Awesome. We'll say you're Steel Defender. It can't do anything, right?
Leopold Magnus 00:22:30 Uh, no. Yeah, it's out of range. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:22:33 Okay, so we're gonna say that it always goes like on your turn technically so that I'm not gonna I'm not gonna throw like legendary actions in between you and it so after both of your turns it is This um this dude he is going to does he have 30 feet he might not be able to reach you He is 30 feet of movement, okay
Kaladin Shash 00:23:00 Yeah. Turn away. That does not hit because I used shield as my reactant. I'll put the spell slot down.
Dungeon Master 00:23:00 I'll move forward to the closest person and take. He's got those three strikes. Oh, I will. With my dice that's rolling so good. 18 to hit. Okay. Uh, 23 to hit.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:16 Yeah. That's bummer. Oh yeah, good call. Do you want to wait on shield then? Okay.
Kaladin Shash 00:23:32 That meets it beats it. Damn it. Yeah, OK. Oh, that's good point. You're gonna you're gonna. You're gonna need some mirror image. No. Your image needs the whole I need to hang on to this for rounds. It's an image.
Dungeon Master 00:23:35 OK, roll for mirror image 2. 19, so this one hits. Yeah, this hit. OK, and then the last one, let me make sure. 18, roll to see if it hits your mirror image.
Kaladin Shash 00:24:03 Well, if it doesn't meet my armor class, it doesn't. Well, I guess the armor class of the mirror image is 15. It doesn't. It does. Burning these 19s, man. Burning 19s, say that.
Dungeon Master 00:24:06 It was before that I, yeah, I'd forgotten that you had it until I realized that you had cast it a while ago. 1962. Okay, next up will be Legendary Action from
Zariel Torgan 00:24:19 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:24:29 The Reverend, he's going to, seeing that he's surrounded, you see he sort of smirks a bit, like a little bit enjoying this. He'll fly directly between the two of you. From to the side. Hits the ground, no longer flying, and he takes one big circular slash, hitting both of you, technically both of his attacks, but he'll throw out one enormous swing to hit both of you.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:02 Don't forget your guy can impose disadvantage. Oh yeah, no, I was talking to Rex. He's got deflect attack with his defender as a reaction. He can impose disadvantage on a creature that he sees within five feet.
Dungeon Master 00:25:07 Um, it's like part of his attack economy. Um, so he'll do it like technically as like his third thing he does, but he's going to attack first. Were you talking to Rex about his guy?
Zariel Torgan 00:25:31 provided it's against a different creature. So for the attack against Donnie, for against Ratchet, he could impose disadvantage. If he wants to. He doesn't have to.
Leopold Magnus 00:25:34 Oh, man. Where? OK, yeah, I missed that little tidbit. Where where is that? Yeah, I will do that. I'm just trying to figure out this guy because I'm trying to add into my extras and they're not they're not popping up, but whatever. Yeah, I will absolutely. Imposed disadvantage. Hell, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:25:38 Mm-hmm. Yeah. Is that what he would like to do? First one's a natural 20. Second one is a natural 10. Good disadvantage.
Kaladin Shash 00:25:44 It's like you said, he's like that reaction place.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:02 Oh. Come on, Donny. Oh, damn.
Dungeon Master 00:26:06 Why am I asking you guys? I should know this. 16 hit Donnie. I think Ace-D, 18, because he's technically got a shield. It should... Yeah, so misses on that. The swing towards the Steel Defender does not have disadvantage though, right? It's just against a different creature. A natural 18 hit for 24.
Kaladin Shash 00:26:14 It might. He's like soft leathers and stuff, man. Sweet, he's good.
Leopold Magnus 00:26:29 Yeah. Yeah, that definitely hits because AC is 15. And you said it's a.
Dungeon Master 00:26:41 That'll be a 6 slashing damage plus a 17 radiant damage. So that's 23. He has 21, so that does take him down. But that is his turn.
Leopold Magnus 00:26:57 How many hit points did it have? Like only like 21 or something. All right. Still didn't finish down. Oh, okay.
Dungeon Master 00:27:12 Oh, that's his Legendary Action, sorry. Oh, that was his Legendary Action. He can only attack one creature on that. He does not hit your Steel Defender then. He just misses his attack on Ratchet. That was my B. Wasted that natural 20 on disadvantage then. Zariel, it is your turn. You are up.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:26 Damn. All right, so talk to me about the Reverend. Is he wearing that armor that he looks like he's wearing? Is the sword he's holding made of metal?
Dungeon Master 00:27:49 No, he's actually shirtless. Appears to be. Now, before you cast heat metal, I will remind you that the sword did seem to float to him, so you don't know for certain that he needs to hold it.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:59 All right, I'm going to move up to get as close as I can. Yes. Does he seem to have anything else on him that's metal?
Kaladin Shash 00:28:06 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:28:21 No, that was just the coolest photo I could find. He's like a naked form that appeared out of the body of the other guy. What you've noticed is that when he holds the sword, it seems to do a little bit more damage. When he's got it floating around, it's like the D8 versus the D10. So currently he's holding it with two hands, but you don't know that he needs to.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:29 So it looks like he could use the sword to attack somebody without holding the sword. All right. Let's see. Can't get, can't
Dungeon Master 00:28:55 Good question, so I like the creativity there. Stand up, so you use half your movement. Yeah, you were unconscious. It felt.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:58 Get there. Well, I'll move my movement anyway. I'll get to right there. And then... Ah, shit, you're right. Damn it. Damn it. You're right. Okay, so I'm like right there. I can't do anything. I'm just thinking, I'm just thinking. I'm gonna use my action to... Oh, that's not what I wanted to do.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:28 Disregard that. And then let's see... I don't want to do that because it's got dex for everybody there. I'm just going to go ahead and do Faerie Fire. I'm going to get a dex 14 save from the Reverend.
Dungeon Master 00:29:28 That's all right. You got it. It doesn't have preference in that one, so it'll just be plus 1. That's a 12.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:59 failure. So he is illuminated in this, like, oil sheen glowing green liquid as I reach out my hand and this almost oil slick shoots out and coats him as it begins to glow and vibrate, making him a little easier to see. And then bonus action, I'm going to heal myself with one of those pump things in the armor.
Dungeon Master 00:30:29 Perfect. That's a minor healing potion equivalent. So 3D4 plus 2. Really nice. Next up, Legendary Action.
Zariel Torgan 00:30:34 Okay. Then that is my turn. Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:31:00 He will just, he'll make another attack. He'll finish out what he said. So cinematically, it's still the same. He took a big swing, but it just happened over the span of a little bit. He'll attack the steel defender. 18 to hit the steel defender. It takes 12 plus,
Leopold Magnus 00:31:19 Yeah, that is. Down. 19.
Dungeon Master 00:31:29 10, takes 22 damage. So everything's the exact same, down just a little bit later.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:36 So what's your intelligence, Leo? So wouldn't your guy have, because you're level 4, it says your hit points are 2 plus your intelligence modifier, plus 5 times your artificial level. So wouldn't that make it 22 plus, like, 3? Or 4, I mean? Would it be 26?
Dungeon Master 00:32:01 Well, it's 2 plus 4, 6, and then 5 times 3 is 15, so it's 6 plus 15, 21. 2 plus 4 is 6, plus 15, 21.
Leopold Magnus 00:32:01 So it's two plus my intelligence, so that's six. Five times three, yeah. I'm only a third level artificer, not a fourth level. Yeah. So then, yeah, you're right. That would be 15, 21 plus two, you said? Got it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:07 Yeah, that's... Oh, you're not... You're... Oh... Oh... Okay. No, no, 21's it. Okay, my bad. I was just... I didn't know you didn't have all four levels. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:32:33 Yeah, otherwise that would be 26, right? No, that's helpful from my understanding.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:38 But never mind. You're good. Sorry. I'll be quiet.
Dungeon Master 00:32:44 Okay, don't worry. It is this dude. He can't get there. Can't get there. He will use movement and action to just get up behind Leopold, but that is all he can do. Kaladin, you are up next.
Kaladin Shash 00:33:12 Do these monks, what are they wearing? Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:33:16 a simple garb similar as the reverend like the original bodies they sort of burst out of were just clothed like clerics so they pop out and they're like for the sake of you know pg-ness like they have like cloth underwear but they're shirtless
Kaladin Shash 00:33:42 I'm gonna use the, I'm gonna make a melee attack with my, my spear. 21 hits. Great. Then can I also do,
Dungeon Master 00:33:54 Let's see, 21 hits. 11 doesn't often do poison damage. Nice. No joke.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:57 Ice. Ice.
Kaladin Shash 00:34:08 You guys gonna send me is one of the poison damage little charges there for just one additional for 12. And then no. I only have one attack right now, cause I don't even think I get like an off hand bonus action thing.
Dungeon Master 00:34:25 Just one attack would be more than one. OK. OK, any bonus actions?
Kaladin Shash 00:34:38 Not going to run, farm sand. No, because the only bonus action spell I have right now is Misty Step, so no.
Dungeon Master 00:34:55 Right at the end of your turn, the Reverend will use another, his last legendary action of the round. He'll make an attack at Ratshit with disadvantage still. Is that correct? Yeah, if he attacks Ratshit. No, oh, so he can't impose that. So just normal then.
Kaladin Shash 00:35:14 Rushed it very soon. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:16 No, the defender's down.
Leopold Magnus 00:35:19 Yeah, defenders down.
Dungeon Master 00:35:32 15, 21 hits. I think he, no matter what he's going to do, enough damage. I don't think it's possible for him not to knock him down. 18, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:35:52 Go ahead and see it coming.
Dungeon Master 00:35:53 rat shit goes down skewered through like not a vital organ but like top of shoulder and then it's burst out the top his arms sort of just hanging on there a little bit um and then it is his turn he's now unconscious and he's making death seams first one will be
Dungeon Master 00:36:31 It's a fail. Next up is the Reverend. He will see that he's downed these two. Somebody roll me a D3. I'm sorry, a D4.
Leopold Magnus 00:36:48 I got to see you, Zario.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:50 Yeah, I got it. Two.
Dungeon Master 00:36:59 It is Kaladin. Got how much fly? Oh yeah, he's got a lot of movement. Throws, he's not going to be thinking in terms of advantage versus disadvantage because I would say he's not very threatened in this moment. Just up to the side of you and he's going to take two swings.
Leopold Magnus 00:37:31 Jesus Christ.
Dungeon Master 00:37:34 22 to hit. And an extra one. Does it hit your mirror image? Grand, grand. Norris, he.
Zariel Torgan 00:37:50 Brent, I think you're muted Brent.
Kaladin Shash 00:37:57 Sorry guys, what were you asking? Uh, let me roll that last dice for that. It does indeed, it does indeed, so no. To miss. Perfect.
Dungeon Master 00:38:02 Rolled a 22 and a natural one, but does the 22 hit your mirror image? Okay, and then the other one was a natural one, so he misses no matter what. Top of the round, layer action 20, somebody roll me a d4, we'll see what happens.
Zariel Torgan 00:38:32 I'll go ahead and roll it. Three, Jesus Christ.
Leopold Magnus 00:38:34 Do it. That layer is too powerful. No, we just rolled the one that does something. This guy is more powerful than when we came after him in the first place.
Dungeon Master 00:38:38 You guys got to roll something other than threes. What does it you haven't even one of them does nothing. That is an option. You just keep stealing.
Dungeon Master 00:39:07 The downside is that his followers keep stealing, too. OK. Leopold, it is your turn.
Leopold Magnus 00:39:12 Yeah. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Boys, I don't know about this one. And you just see an antenna kind of shoot up from the back of my head, but I'm not peeking around the rock. You only see the antenna sticking out and it starts to glow with the hum of a
Leopold Magnus 00:39:42 powerful lightning bolt, and I will cast Witch Bolt at the second level. And to hit... Oh, for fuck's sake. I don't think 8 hits, does it? So the lightning strikes astray, snuffed out by the round around it.
Dungeon Master 00:39:52 Does not. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:40:07 And then with my bonus action, I will use my last remaining Magic Stone. Yeah, I don't think a natural 1's gonna hit either. One of those goes. Yeah, Stone goes flying across. It shows that I'm not looking where I'm pointing, where I'm shooting. That's my turn.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:23 Oof, that's rough.
Dungeon Master 00:40:40 Okay. Does your shield defender make death saves or anything?
Leopold Magnus 00:40:47 I don't know. I think once it's down, it's just kind of dead until I bring it back. Let me. Yeah, I mean, all it says is it can repair itself. It also says that. Where is it? There was a there's a bit. And it's description, it says, I can bring it back from the dead.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:15 But yeah, if it has died within the last hour you use your Smith's tools and in action to revive it provided I'm within five feet It's been a spell slot of the first level or higher. Yeah So Returns to life after one minute all of its hit points restored after one minute. So that's that's like basically what ten rounds of combat You
Dungeon Master 00:41:40 Yeah, well, 10 rounds of combat, yeah, would be a minute.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:45 Yeah, so I can, I can pick it up with one first level spell slot, but it's still out of the action for 10 rounds. So takes it out for a long time. No, no way to bring it back. No one does this.
Dungeon Master 00:42:12 Okay, so we'll just call it out then for now. Just to save that. It is this sort of lesser angelic being. It does care about advantage, so it's going to rotate around and then take its attacks on Buchaladan. 10 to hit.
Leopold Magnus 00:42:16 Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:42:39 Does not hit. Does not hit. This is way better. Yeah, not yet. So we should do last one swing and a miss. Doesn't hit unless he's got a plus 2. 18 does hit.
Dungeon Master 00:42:44 Natural three to hit for a five. 15 is one of them. Okay, 18 to hit. Okay, any shield? Okay, and then last attack.
Kaladin Shash 00:43:07 No, wait and see what the big guy does. That guy has four attacks. Yeah. One hit perfect. I'm on board. Done.
Dungeon Master 00:43:15 Natural 19, so 24 to hit. So, 2 hits. He has 3. It was... Oh, never mind then. It was just 1 attack then. I mean 1 hit. I forgot that he missed twice. 8 damage. Layer action, 15. We're going to do a pure luck check.
Dungeon Master 00:43:46 Do you want me to roll it in front of the table, or do you guys want to roll it? It'll be a D20. 11 or higher is good. 10 or lower is bad.
Leopold Magnus 00:43:57 Well, I don't know about you guys, but I'm on fire. I don't know about that. That sounds like a really bad idea, but you know. Dude, it was a one and then it went. It was a 19. That was that was great.
Kaladin Shash 00:44:00 All of you roll it, Leopold. Roll it down.
Zariel Torgan 00:44:03 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:44:17 19. In this heated battle that's not looking good for you guys in this moment, it seems that things are about to turn for the worse. You hear down this dark tunnel over here, just a bunch of grunting and struggling. And then bursting onto the scene, you see a pretty badly injured Sylvaris.
Kaladin Shash 00:44:37 Perfect. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:44:46 pop into the room, holding his side as his armor's sort of broken apart, his face is bloodied, his blonde hair soaked in a little bit of his blood and blood that looks distinctly different somehow. He's carrying his sword loosely and his shield is hanging and he's sort of winded, but he looks at me and he goes, don't, don't, I mean, whew. Okay guys, what the fuck is going on?
Zariel Torgan 00:45:00 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:45:16 Let's go. That is his full action to get into the space, but you have another combatant, Annard. Up next is going to be Zariel.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:28 All right, I'm gonna use my full movement to get to right here. I'm gonna use my bonus action healing word at first level. I'm gonna get Ratchet back up. That's gonna be six heals. And then I have a question for you. So if I get the ruler, this guy is like,
Kaladin Shash 00:45:35 So.
Dungeon Master 00:45:54 Yep. Like if you intentionally hit like the other side of him.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:59 10 feet wide as his icon. Now, I would like to throw an ice knife and have it not blow up and hit Kaladin. Is that possible, or should I try to do something else? Yeah, or if he's tall, I could try to hit tall or hit to where it, because it's going to hit the side of him away from Kaladin.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:27 You know, so if I aim for like here or something, oh sorry, like here or something. Is that something I could try?
Dungeon Master 00:46:28 No, I gotcha. We'll say this. It'll only fail if you exactly hit his armor class. Anything above that will be a good enough shot to fully do what you're intending to do. So if you hit just exactly 18, it'll hit Kaladin, but anything above that will fully do what you're intending.
Kaladin Shash 00:46:50 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:57 Okay, so I take a big wet chunk of my hair, and I just wring a little bit of water out of it, and this liquid drops into this icicle, and I fling it through the air, and... Come on, big money. Ah! And it does not hit. It just flies right past.
Kaladin Shash 00:47:21 On the wall. Did it hit the target? OK, only exactly, I'll take that.
Dungeon Master 00:47:24 Uhm, if even if it misses, it still explodes, right? It won't take out and I said only if it exactly hits his AC. You've got it. Why do you have advantage on?
Zariel Torgan 00:47:28 Uh, it does. But, uh... But now, uh... I guess, yeah. Okay. So, yeah, I'm gonna need, uh, DC 14 deck save. Oh, I have advantage on him. I have advantage because of Faerie Fire.
Kaladin Shash 00:47:53 No, it's on him.
Dungeon Master 00:47:56 Was very far cast where he is right now. It doesn't if he leave this space. It doesn't affect him. And then doesn't say anything about leaving or is he still?
Zariel Torgan 00:48:03 I thought it was on him. It said, any creature in the area when the spell is cast is outlined. It said, for the duration, objects and creatures affected shed dim light in a 10-foot radius. So it doesn't say either way specifically, but it does say that
Zariel Torgan 00:48:31 Any creature in the area when it's cast is outlined. But it just says for the duration. So it doesn't say for the duration if it stays inside. So. Alright. That's a lot of buildup for me to not roll this good again. Ayyyy, 23. Alright. Okay, so this is for the piercing damage. Nice!
Dungeon Master 00:48:34 Perfect. Yeah. Let us go ahead and roll another check to see if you hit him with the first one. Nice. Okay. You hit him with both. Nice.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:49 That's some money right there.
Kaladin Shash 00:48:51 Pretend always like that.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:03 Okay. And then I'm going to need a dex 14 on the ice damage. Okay. So that's going to be 10 ice damage or cold damage.
Dungeon Master 00:49:17 Uh, 10. That was almost a 19. 20 damage. Big hit. Instantly from fine to not so fine.
Leopold Magnus 00:49:28 Woo! Zing! Is that 20 damage? Good shot, Zario!
Zariel Torgan 00:49:34 It's my turn. I pull up my fingers like little western guns and, oh yeah. Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:49:49 After your turn, he's going to use his first legendary action of a round. And he will do... He can move his speed without performing Opportunity Attack. He will... close the distance with you. It is now...
Zariel Torgan 00:50:12 Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:50:16 This guy is turned next to Leopold. He'll just take two attacks on you. Oh, he's got three, sorry. I forget which one has two and three. Fourteen. Sixteen. And natural one.
Kaladin Shash 00:50:30 The chain. It's really pretty. Everything's coming. It's either a gift or sex.
Leopold Magnus 00:50:33 No. Yeah, not a minute.
Dungeon Master 00:50:41 After his turn, the Reverend will use his secondary legendary action, Jesus. And he'll take an attack on Sariel. Does 15 hits on him.
Zariel Torgan 00:50:56 Good luck. No.
Kaladin Shash 00:51:03 Yeah, I'm on it, man, I'm on it. I got this guy right in front of me still.
Dungeon Master 00:51:12 I don't believe it does. All righty. After his turn, it's Kaladin. Yep. Yep.
Leopold Magnus 00:51:24 Brent, it's to you.
Kaladin Shash 00:51:33 And he looks really healthy still. I know, it's driving me nuts. I'm gonna go ahead and Misty Step and then run up to the Reverend and take an attack with advantage. I have to switch over to the attacks I'm not used to using that side of it.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:35 He's getting healed like 68 this fight. Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:51:51 Love it. No, Donnie went down. 23 hits. Yes.
Kaladin Shash 00:52:03 Is blessed still a thing right now? It's perfect 23 hit then. Oh, I rolled the one handed. Can I roll the two handed there? Doesn't matter, same number. That's really funny. Here it comes. One.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:06 Nah, red shit went down. Oh no. Oh!
Dungeon Master 00:52:24 A 2 plus, I mean, it said you rolled a 2, but isn't it plus strength or dex? Don't you have something to add to that? So 7 plus 8.
Kaladin Shash 00:52:33 Yeah, they're both true. Yeah, that's funny. Oh, it didn't add it. You're right. It should be plus five. I'm hitting the roll. That's funny. It didn't add that. Yeah. That's going to be it for my turn.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:40 Yeah, it's plus five. That's not bad.
Dungeon Master 00:52:55 Nice. Is that it for your turn, sir? Now he'll use his last legendary action for the round. He can't do Guiding Bolt because that takes two of them. He's got one left. He'll take another attack on Kaladin who's come up behind and he's getting a little frantic. 18 to hit.
Kaladin Shash 00:53:28 Yeah, that hits I knew that was gonna it's okay. It's fine. I'm still looking good. I can take another one of those
Dungeon Master 00:53:33 Okay. He will. You take 7 plus 15. You take 22 points of damage. Okay. You healed Ratchet, right? He's up. I don't know why he didn't update.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:46 Ugh. Yeah, I healed him for seven. Or more than that. Well, it might have been seven. It wasn't a strong roll.
Dungeon Master 00:54:05 It was seven. OK. He's actually alive on his turn. He will. Are you guys looking hurt at all? Does he need to throw out a heel? Uh.
Kaladin Shash 00:54:05 Missed.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:26 He should bless again. Oh. Well, he can move, right?
Dungeon Master 00:54:32 Right, right, right, right. OK, he'll do less, but it's got a 30 foot range. So it'll hit Zariel and it'll hit Paladin. You are 40 feet away. Hold on, he can't do this. You can get to about here. 30 on the dot. 25. Kaladin is out so he can't get.
Kaladin Shash 00:54:36 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:55:00 both Kaladin and Leopold. It'll be one or the other. You guys are just outside of the range. Okay, so he'll basically stand straddling over the Steel Defender and hit both of you with the Bless and himself because he's got that third person he can do it with. And then he will bonus action use his Syringe on himself.
Zariel Torgan 00:55:04 Oh, gotcha. Nice.
Leopold Magnus 00:55:07 Yeah, haven't put on talented.
Kaladin Shash 00:55:07 Can you hear me?
Dungeon Master 00:55:32 Oh, cool. He heals four. Okay, after his turn, it is the Reverend's turn proper. He's like a wild animal. You get the sense in this moment that just being this sort of celestial creature,
Dungeon Master 00:56:01 doesn't mean that he's human. There are like some very animalistic traits that pop out. And he swings wildly at the both of you, again doing sort of this one big swing to sort of make up his two attacks. And he'll do it with, he's still holding out with both hands. Four, so ten to hit on the first.
Dungeon Master 00:56:27 And dirty 20, so it went Zario Kaladin. 20 to hit Kaladin. I believe that hits. He didn't shield last time, he might shield this time. Okay. Perfect. And then he hasn't been doing it because it hasn't been necessary. He will do his battlefield rejection.
Kaladin Shash 00:56:45 Sorry man, that's exactly what I said. I'm gonna shield this time.
Dungeon Master 00:56:57 He will choose three creatures I can see within 30 feet of it. And until the end of his next turn, each target will subtract a d4 to its attack rolls and saving throws, depending on if I want it to be a benefit or a negative. So it'll be the three of you. So your Bless is sort of countered in this moment.
Kaladin Shash 00:57:15 OK. Yeah. Yeah, don't let him heal whoever hasn't. Might be mine again. Who wants it? I'm rolling it up. I just threw it out. I got a three that had to happen.
Dungeon Master 00:57:24 Start of the round, layer action 20. Somebody roll me that d4. Do not roll a three. How about I do it? Oh, you got it. Three. No, he was looking pretty hurt.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:34 Yeah, I did it last time.
Leopold Magnus 00:57:38 I can do it. Yeah, you go ahead, John. One of you guys. I'm telling you, he's juiced up, man. He's like one of those anabolic guys in Mexico. Big ol' pecked, man, dude. They're just smashing us around.
Dungeon Master 00:57:54 Everybody heal, all his guys heal three. Leopold, it is your turn.
Kaladin Shash 00:57:54 There's veins.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:01 I like to imagine that us rolling all these threes, we're just accidentally punching him with the healing syringes over and over again. And take that! Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:58:13 It's just jabbing them up. Yeah, what's going to happen? You know what I'm going to do? I am going to do. Let's see, is there any large rocks or boulders near me? This is like an old temple. Is the floor broken up? Are there any large chunks?
Leopold Magnus 00:58:41 Uh, the stone floor accessible. Okay. Yeah. I'm going to reach out. I'm going to, I'm going to pick that up. I'm assuming 10 pounds. How heavy are we talking?
Dungeon Master 00:58:44 Not necessarily, but you think that this like big stone bowl brazier that's like right in front of you isn't attached. It looks like it's placed. Oh, way more than that. It's like a huge stone bowl with like a bunch of charcoal and fire.
Kaladin Shash 00:58:47 and for pebbles.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:11 Ah, I see. OK. Yeah, I think 10 pounds is the limit here. Let's see. Object weighing 1 to 5 pounds.
Dungeon Master 00:59:16 Are you looking for something like small and under 10 pounds? Yeah, we'll say it's pretty limited supply. Like. There's a D6 is number of small objects like that that fit the description of the room.
Kaladin Shash 00:59:20 Are you trying to?
Leopold Magnus 00:59:43 Okay, any within insight or range? I mean, I've got a 30 foot walk. All right, yeah. So I'm gonna, do I need to leave this space then? Grab that. Okay, great. It's not like I have to walk across the room and pick a rocket, got it.
Dungeon Master 00:59:48 There's four of them. Yeah, you can grab one. You do have to pop out anything you do. You need to have one aside. That's it. No.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:07 Um, yeah, it's, uh, at the, uh, first level, I am going to cast catapult. Um, so Leopold, uh, uh, slides out from behind cover, grabs a stone of hefty mass, something that would really hurt and just drops it down into his stomach chamber and his head kind of peels back and you just hear this boom.
Dungeon Master 01:00:27 Like a human gun.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:35 hollow sound rings from the inside of his armor. As he bends down, his head snaps backwards, and the rock goes flying out, and I will cast Catapult. Essentially, yeah. And this, yeah, kind of echoing noise thunders through the chamber.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:51 Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:01:00 Okay, as you roll, a Nat 1 will result in you hitting either Zariel or Kaladin, but anything else will just be totally fine. He does have advantage because he's under the effects of Faerie Fire. Yes.
Leopold Magnus 01:01:08 Ah, okay. Actually, this one is... I don't know if this matters for Fairy Fart. If the object would strike a creature, so I have to roll to hit, and then they make a dex save. Is that how that works? Really? Let's see.
Zariel Torgan 01:01:30 Damn. That makes sense. Probably be your spell attack modifier, I would guess.
Dungeon Master 01:01:33 Catapult does decent damage for being a low-level spell, so I think there's some caveat to it.
Leopold Magnus 01:01:39 It just says, if the object would strike a creature, but it doesn't say what to roll. Yeah, I guess it's just interesting, because on all the other ones that are rolled a hit, there's a little box that I can just click to roll it. Paddlepole doesn't have that, so. For what? It just has a deck save of 14.
Dungeon Master 01:02:04 What does yours have? What does it have? Then it's just a Dex save. I mean, Dex doesn't seem to be a strong suit, so it's a good talk. Nine.
Kaladin Shash 01:02:04 Hello.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:12 So it's just weirded kind of strangely then. But anyhow, yeah, so the brick goes flying, deck save of 14, fails, he takes, I cast it at the first level, 3d8, 14 damage on the catapult.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:12 Yeah, I think you're right. Yeah. 38. Nice. Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:02:38 Nice. Nice. Good turn. After your turn, he'll use a Legendary Action.
Kaladin Shash 01:02:39 Pretty eight. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:42 EAT RUGS, REVEREND! And with bonus action, I'll just cast Magic Stone again, so that way I can have those accessible. And that's my turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:04 Very good. I have a quick question. Is he size large or larger?
Dungeon Master 01:03:09 Is it obvious that one of you two is more hurt than the other, or are you pretty comparable? You're pretty comparable. He will just two or lower go after Kaladin, three or four goes after Zarya. Three goes after Zarya. Yes. He is...
Kaladin Shash 01:03:12 Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:03:40 Large. Yes. 22 to hit. You take 6 plus.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:41 Okay. Thank you. That was it. God damn it. All right, yeah, that's it.
Kaladin Shash 01:03:57 On the ground again.
Dungeon Master 01:04:09 21, you take 27 points of damage. Fairy Fire, gone. Zariel, down. Next up... is... this dude who's all by him, Lonesome.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:11 Oh, fuck. Yeah, down. Fairy fire drops.
Kaladin Shash 01:04:33 you
Dungeon Master 01:04:39 He will hustle, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. He'll action, dash, just up there, but he can't do anything on his turn. After his turn, it'll be legendary action again, attack on Kaladin. This time with advantage.
Kaladin Shash 01:05:11 those numbers
Dungeon Master 01:05:11 14 both times. Dirty 20. Nice. Does shield last until the start of the round or the start of your next turn? Perfect. Nice, nice, nice. No, great. After that is Sylvaris.
Zariel Torgan 01:05:25 Next turn.
Dungeon Master 01:05:41 Uh, he will do... What is his movement? Uh, 30 feet. He can get to there. Does he have ranged attacks? You see he pulls out on his gauntlet, he's just like, it pops up a metal plate and he's got like a little compact crossbow. He'll just shoot from where he has instead of burning his action.
Kaladin Shash 01:05:52 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:06:08 just to get an attack in on this other guy who's untouched. Fourteen doesn't hit, but he gets three attacks. Oh, that was the wrong thing. This is only a plus six. Misses. It would help if I can roll. Misses.
Zariel Torgan 01:06:39 Beep boop beep.
Dungeon Master 01:06:40 Awesome, great turn. Up next, I'll heal you. The Reverend is, because he's so hurt, he's going to burn his last legendary action. Instead of saving it for anything, he'll just take his last attack on Kaladin. That is...
Kaladin Shash 01:06:44 We needed that. That's okay.
Dungeon Master 01:07:10 I don't think if it registered. Hold on. It was a 17 and a 19, but it didn't count it. No, those are on the dice. But this is 1813, so the top one was. I don't know why it's not going through. 21.
Kaladin Shash 01:07:15 Okay, when that's those total or was that without bonus Okay, so what's your To miss
Dungeon Master 01:07:40 Okay. He's just not hitting on you. Up next is this dude behind Leopold. He's gonna move up again, take his attacks like the loyal guy he is. First attack. Oh, right, it was your turn. No, I didn't mean to just give you that. Go ahead and roll your death save.
Kaladin Shash 01:07:53 Thank goodness.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:59 I'm going to roll a death save, okay? All right, no worries. It's not letting me. Here we go. Big money. Ha, four. All right. So one fail.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:02 Shit, you're down again.
Dungeon Master 01:08:28 fail uh zariel as you lay there unconscious again you have this moment where you're you're like you're barely conscious technically unconscious right but your character is laying there and is sort of phasing in and out you see like some static run across your eyes and then you find yourself alive
Kaladin Shash 01:08:28 Thank you very much.
Dungeon Master 01:08:56 You don't know what year it is, but you're standing guard at a door, staring at a very important looking man, a man who carries himself with great respect and wealth and power. Fine silk robes hang very nicely fit. He's got cuffs to keep it at his arms where he wants them. He's got him about mid forearm at this point.
Dungeon Master 01:09:21 his hair is tied back up with like a lovely gold brooch, uh, sort of pushed through the center of his bun and like a little blade. Um, he just stands there looking out the window. And as you look down at the table behind him, as he stares out the window, you see all of these texts in these ruins. And as you're sitting there, go ahead and give me just an investigation check or perception.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:04 Sorry, did you say perception? Okay, sorry, one second. My thing just shut down right in the middle of me doing something. Dirty 20.
Dungeon Master 01:10:06 Yeah. 30, 20. You see on these like runes and these papers and all these parchments and scrolls, like lines conducted and drawn on from different pieces of paper. They're not even like the same script.
Dungeon Master 01:10:26 But all of it sort of like indicates, and you see repeatedly written over and over again, far north, far north, to the tree, to the tree, ahead, things like that. And then the sort of vision phases, and that is your turn. Then we go to this guy who is going to attack Leopold three times. He's already missed once. You know how it is.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:55 Gotta be good to hit Leo. Misses. Misses.
Dungeon Master 01:10:58 Um, yeah, that's what he's finding. Okay, second attack. Uh, 15 to hit. 14 to hit. End of his turn. Kaladin, you're up.
Kaladin Shash 01:10:59 Great, that was great. I'm going to use my movement. Oh, no, I'm going to move out of his range.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:15 This is just a.
Kaladin Shash 01:11:29 I'm going to use my second Misty Step to move myself right over to here, just so I don't provoke the Opportunity Attack out of the other guy. I'm going to cast Burning Hands. Yeah, it's deck saves.
Dungeon Master 01:11:35 Okay. Mm-hmm. Nice. Is that dex saves on both of them? Or is it just... We'll do the lesser dude first, because I have this sheet pulled up. He's actually more dexterous. Uh, 16.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:48 Nice. Nice.
Kaladin Shash 01:12:03 That's a save. So I'll take half damage. The damage is already rolled there. That's great. So I'll take full damage. I'm going to use my movement to skirt around towards. Yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to go ahead and keep skirting around and I'm going to use one of my syringes on Zariel.
Dungeon Master 01:12:06 And then this is the reverend. He rolled a natural two for a three. 13 and half rounded down is six.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:27 Oh, nice. Okay. That's 2d4 plus 4. Oh, 2, yeah. Okay. Thank you. It's still up.
Kaladin Shash 01:12:29 So you can go ahead and roll that. I'll just drop it off the inventory. That still sucks. Those are crit fails.
Dungeon Master 01:12:42 54 plus two. Nice. After your turn will be
Zariel Torgan 01:12:56 They've been better, but I'm up, so that's good. Absolutely.
Kaladin Shash 01:12:58 Get around to action, get around to action. Alright, that's my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:13:11 Ratchet's turn, he will move up a bit. He is still concentrating on Bless, so he won't do anything to break that. But he will do... He already used one of his third levels. He'll do a Mass Healing Word. So, Kaladin and Zariel and then Sylvaris will also get this 4. You'll heal 1d4 plus 4.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:41 Nice. Oh, never mind. Damn!
Dungeon Master 01:13:46 Everybody heals eight. And then it is the reverend's turn proper. Well.
Leopold Magnus 01:13:50 Right. I can't kill above money.
Dungeon Master 01:14:14 Both of you are on one side. He doesn't get advantage anymore. He will. Oh, I forgot that he did his battlefield rejection. These should have had, like, negative d4s when applicable. He'll just take two attacks. One on each of you. First one, natural two. Second one.
Dungeon Master 01:14:41 Natural 19 for 25. I was going left to right. So Zariel, you get the 25 on you. Sorry. Yeah. You take 12 plus 26. You take 38 points of damage.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:47 Oof. Shield. Oh, Jesus. Like a ragdoll, up and down, up and down. I haven't even stood up yet.
Kaladin Shash 01:15:05 Sorry, it's just. Yeah, I don't want to roll it. I don't want to roll it.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:09 Is any more of that metallic underbody showing itself? Okay. Yeah, you roll another three and see what happens.
Dungeon Master 01:15:14 We'll get to that. On your turn, if you want to make a perception check, you can. Top of the round, layer action on 20. Somebody roll me that d4. I can roll it if you guys are tired. Okay, I got it. One. We haven't got this before. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:28 Yeah, too many threes. You better not. Yeah. We all get healed. Can it be me? Shouldn't I auto fail because I'm dead? Natural one.
Dungeon Master 01:15:39 One a divine beam blinds a player who rolls the lowest number. So this is rollies. Everybody roll d20 No, this is luck Nice It is it's very very helpful you guys see
Kaladin Shash 01:15:39 I love this. Oh God, you just knew it was going to be you. I mean, if you want to sacrifice yourself, fine.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:56 That's actually kind of helpful, I guess.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:58 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:16:02 Zoriel doesn't see it but everybody in the room you see the stained glass at the top of the stairs shimmers and focuses and these beams of light sort of coordinate and strike in the middle they meet each other and they shoot down and hit his unconscious body you see the flesh or
Dungeon Master 01:16:20 Synthetic flesh starts burning away and various parts of his body are metallic underneath, like finely sinewed muscle of like metal instead. So forearms are ropey metallic. You see an articulating joint on one of the elbows. But like it is an intense light hitting his body directly next to you, Kaladin. But up next is Leopold. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:16:44 Under Zahrael's skin, that's what we just saw. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:51 I'm sorry, but did anyone else catch the song? Like right as you're describing that Darth Vader's like laborious breathing was in the background. I'm just like, Oh shit. Perfect timing for that. Um,
Dungeon Master 01:17:02 It is, it's thrown at the end of that song.
Leopold Magnus 01:17:09 All right, yeah, Leopold watching Zariel just get hacked to pieces here, screams out, leave my friend alone and charges in. I only have a movement of 30 feet, so. I'll move to there and then I'll yell out.
Kaladin Shash 01:17:20 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:17:35 Donnie! Donnie Ratchet, duck! And I'll scoop up another large stone. And I will at this time cast Catapult, but at the second level. So it's a DC 14 deck save. Aha! Does not beat it. So he will take 48.
Zariel Torgan 01:17:47 Nice. Jesus.
Dungeon Master 01:17:48 Okay. I can roll above a five, you guys. Seven plus one, eight. Nice.
Kaladin Shash 01:17:52 It's going to be tough. We have a little deli inside.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:07 For fuck's sake, it was the same as the... Alright, but he takes 13 damage. That was my attack, and for my bonus action, I will cast Magic Stone. Yes, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:18:23 So he took 13 damage on that. Okay, he has something called Celestial Fortitude. If a damage reduces this creature to 0 hit points, it must make a constitution saving throw, DC 5 plus the damage taken, to stay up on a success he drops to 1 point. You are about to finish him. He needs to roll a 18 on this dice.
Dungeon Master 01:18:53 Well, he's got a plus 3 to it, so he has to roll 15 on the die. With a natural 2, he does, well, he also has magical resistance, but I'm going to consult you guys on this.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:59 OK. Nice, so it connects.
Zariel Torgan 01:19:00 Good odds.
Kaladin Shash 01:19:04 Yeah. Right, I don't think he cast it on him. Yeah, he's throwing a physical stone at him. I wouldn't say it applies if that's your position.
Dungeon Master 01:19:18 He has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. Technically the spell is affecting the stone. Would you agree? Yeah, okay. Leopold, how do you want to finish him? Yes, he will take one on you.
Leopold Magnus 01:19:32 yeah right after uh charging ahead oh and i actually might add i will take an attack of oh does this guy want an attack of opportunity all right uh so yeah we'll settle that later but after charging ahead uh in defense of his steadfast ally zariel leopold
Kaladin Shash 01:19:34 You love it.
Zariel Torgan 01:19:36 Ooooooh.
Dungeon Master 01:19:55 method.
Leopold Magnus 01:19:57 scrapes down onto the ground, digging deep with his powerful armored hand, grabs a small brick from the floor and sinks it deep into his chest cavity. Bending down, you see him at a perfect 90 degree angle. He whirls up and the brick goes flying, striking the reverend in his chest cavity. Nothing remains.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:25 of his entire broadside. The Reverend looks left and right, realizing his undoing and collapses headfirst onto the floor.
Dungeon Master 01:20:38 falls, face flats. You hear the sword in his hand drop beside his body and it clinks and when it hits the ground you notice it doesn't sound heavy and you look at it and when his hand releases and his body goes limp with death that the metallic shards that made up the blade lose that metal sheen and go back to looking like the pieces of glass from the stained glass that had come out of.
Dungeon Master 01:21:08 They still hold the rough shape forming a blade and a handle and the hilt and everything, but they're no longer metal. It's this blast that sort of sits there hovering in place with each other. We are not out of the woods yet. There's still these other guys. What was the to hit?
Kaladin Shash 01:21:08 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:21:25 Okay, so I did throw a magic stone. I guess that was, I rolled for it after I knew that guy had died, but can I say I just target, uh, 19. Right. Um, hold on. Is Sunseeker been doing anything?
Dungeon Master 01:21:36 19 would hit the other guy too, so you can just direct it to either the one to his right or the one behind you that missed you. His turn is next, but he had to action dash to get up.
Kaladin Shash 01:21:51 He had a full funeral. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:21:58 I see, okay. Yeah, I'll actually direct it to this guy over here, and I'll quip over at Sunseeker and I'll say, this one's for you, Sunseeker! And Hovering Stone will just lock and drill this Undead right between the eyes.
Dungeon Master 01:22:19 Perfect, what was the damage on that? By. Still something. OK, uh. After.
Leopold Magnus 01:22:29 Um, wait, okay. I already rolled a hit. Nevermind. Ignore that. Well, I figured it's fine.
Kaladin Shash 01:22:30 Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:22:48 your turn the reverend can't take legendary actions because he's dead so it'll be this dude right here sees that his sort of masters down and you see tears of gold stream from his eyes as he weeps for the lost like leader of their cult he'll turn to sylvarius sunseeker and he'll take three wild attacks at him
Dungeon Master 01:23:19 First one is a 16, I don't believe that hits him. Natural 1. Natural 19 for a 24. 24 hits. Does 8 damage.
Kaladin Shash 01:23:36 Um,
Dungeon Master 01:23:46 Okay, but then that is Sylvaris's turn. I'm just sort of having a fight with myself at this point. He'll take three attacks with his greatsword at this guy. 23 hits. 12 misses. 22 hits, he does.
Dungeon Master 01:24:15 2d6 plus 5, so it'll be 4d6 plus 10. 25 points of damage. Okay, that was funny.
Kaladin Shash 01:24:18 Hello. Hello.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:29 Dang. That's pretty good for a guy named after a travel trailer. Oh, I'm dead. Oh, shit.
Leopold Magnus 01:24:38 That's funny. Did you actually sing that out in game?
Dungeon Master 01:24:49 his unconscious body. Speaking of which, it is your turn. Prior to that, it is layer action 15, which has been sort of things happening in the background. At this point, Kaladin, I need you to give me a perception check with disadvantage. Kaladin, that's Ariel. Disadvantage.
Kaladin Shash 01:24:50 Okay. With disadvantage, what you said.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:07 Because I'm dead? Oh, Kaladin, sorry, sorry. Yeah, sorry. Bless. You got blessed.
Kaladin Shash 01:25:23 That's not great I'll get blessed on that's right Way to go ratchet plus 216 Oh, that's right, that's right, that's right
Dungeon Master 01:25:27 Do a Bless. Bless is saving throws and attack rolls, not for second checks. Twelve. All I'll give you is in the heat of this fight, you know, blood, sweat, and tears, you just get a whiff of like wildflowers.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:41 Oh, shit. You're right. Damn it. Success.
Dungeon Master 01:25:56 And then it is Zariel's turn. Go ahead and give me a death-saving throw. You have one fail. Nice. Now, I didn't get it. Is it coming through for everybody? I need to reroll my page. Oh, everything just came through last second. Yeah. I literally said that. I complained about it, and the last four rolls popped up.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:17 The roll? Yeah, I got a 16. Oh.
Kaladin Shash 01:26:19 What, 16?
Dungeon Master 01:26:27 Okay, perfect. Next up, this guy. You stayed exactly 30 feet, so he'll hobble up behind you and continue attacking you. 16 to hit, misses. 13 to hit, misses. 11 to hit, misses. It doesn't even matter that I don't have advantage or anything.
Kaladin Shash 01:26:50 I love that. The Reverend's down. I'm just going to move up towards the guy that's by Sunseeker. I'll go ahead and take an attack with advantage against him. Here it comes.
Dungeon Master 01:26:57 10 every single time. Kaladin, it's your turn. Yes. Yes, you will. Add your Bless to this. We'll remember it now. If you need it. If you want to do it all, oh, it's just one attack, so it's like all of them at once. Oh, 24.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:04 Nice.
Kaladin Shash 01:27:20 May not. There you go. There's the, and then the poison's coming in. 12, 14. Oh, I love that. Dang.
Dungeon Master 01:27:27 Hits. Fine. He had 12 HP. How do you want to finish this guy?
Zariel Torgan 01:27:35 Four. Oh, pretty good. Nice. Nice.
Kaladin Shash 01:27:46 I think I would have just snuck up right behind him and a spear just would have popped right through his, like his Adam's apple. Sunseeker wouldn't have seen me just like saw the saw the spear show up.
Dungeon Master 01:27:56 live backspin on your heel, up through the back of his neck, through his throat, and like, through his Adam Apple, but to the bottom of the jaw, and then out of the mouth, is just, falls limp on your blade, casting it down and off. Then you stand basically toe-to-toe with this Omen Knight. You can exchange little pleasantries if you'd like. After that, it is Ratchet's turn.
Dungeon Master 01:28:24 Seeing the situation a little better handled, he will rotate all the way around and he will take... I believe I gave him a weapon. He has a Fang Dax. Oh, it's with advantage. With advantage. 19 hits.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:43 Nice. Oof. Nice. Jesus. D12. Holy shit.
Kaladin Shash 01:28:53 There you go.
Dungeon Master 01:29:00 A 12. 13 damage on this guy. This guy has not been touched. He's at full health. Top of the round. Layer action 20. You still are in the layer. Somebody roll me a d4.
Leopold Magnus 01:29:05 Good night, sissy. The lair happens even though he's dead.
Zariel Torgan 01:29:13 Take that, you ninny. All right, I'll roll it. Four.
Dungeon Master 01:29:31 Yeah, once the encounter ends, we'll stop it, but I want to keep it going. Four. Nothing happens. Leopold, your turn.
Leopold Magnus 01:29:36 Got it. Standing up from my stance, my brick launching stance, my whole torso rotates around to the bow in front of me here.
Kaladin Shash 01:29:45 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:06 And yeah, up, up, up, up, ah. Damn, Ratchet's right next to me. Actually, I think I could place a five foot cube between Ratchet and I and only cover the enemy, right?
Dungeon Master 01:30:37 I'll just cover the enemy, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:39 Okay. Yeah, so for my action, I will create a bonfire, so my wrists kind of snap up, little barrels shoot out from my hollow forearms, and flame begun erupting from my hands, creating a bonfire underneath this closest enemy. And he must succeed on a deck save. 14.
Dungeon Master 01:31:07 Is that immediately or is that on its turn or something like that? Perfect. OK. Dex saving throw. Natural 20.
Kaladin Shash 01:31:08 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:31:11 Any creature in the bonfire space when you cast a spell must succeed a dexterity saving throw. And then must also make a saving throw if it moves into the bonfire, or if it ends on its turn. So that will succeed, but he is still standing amongst fire.
Dungeon Master 01:31:37 If he ends his turn there, he'll take damage. Yeah. Perfect. Good turn.
Leopold Magnus 01:31:41 You'll have to take fire damage. And then as a bonus action, my bonus action will consist of casting Magic Stone to bring it back up, because I've used all three. And that's my turn.
Kaladin Shash 01:31:44 Okay, so.
Dungeon Master 01:32:05 All the way down to the Sylvaris's turn. He is pretty straightforward, hack and slash. He will drop down and forward a little bit and he'll fire his crossbow three times.
Zariel Torgan 01:32:18 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:32:36 Uh, 15 misses. 18 just hits, one hit. And 12 misses. 8 damage. Alrighty, Zariel, your turn. Forgot you were still down to be honest, I would have healed you.
Kaladin Shash 01:32:39 Not trying very hard.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:02 All right. I'm not holding a grudge. Here we go. Success. Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:33:10 Well, your players didn't help you out either. Okay, two and one, I believe. It is this lesser divine warrior. He will move out of Leopold's space
Kaladin Shash 01:33:14 It's fun.
Dungeon Master 01:33:39 to duck behind Ratchet to avoid the crossbows and he'll take an attack on Ratchet. First one is 30, 20 hits. Second one is 19 hits. Last one is 13 misses.
Dungeon Master 01:34:07 That is 9 plus 8, 17 points of damage. Ratchet is down again. We'll just... Kaladin, your turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:34:18 Oof.
Kaladin Shash 01:34:32 Yeah, I'm gonna just. I'm gonna use a fireball from my current position. That's not gonna help me. Oh, there's no bless. Right? So no hit.
Dungeon Master 01:34:40 14 misses, but you lost left because of that, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:35:01 And then I've got no way of administering the. The health injection that's within my suit to Zario, correct? All right. All right. I don't think I'm holding any. Well, let me see my inventory.
Dungeon Master 01:35:11 No, it is self only. That's why it's a free per day use, but it's only self. Did you guys, if I remember correctly, pick up potions from that one lady? Once upon a time?
Zariel Torgan 01:35:14 out.
Kaladin Shash 01:35:31 I might be holding something. These have absolutely no. Are you going to figure out a great way to use it?
Leopold Magnus 01:35:37 I have a potion of hover that lets me float above the ground a few inches for seven seconds. Yeah. And it was pretty useless. Oh, I mean, it'll come in handy at some point, but yeah, definitely. But it's not super helpful in this situation.
Dungeon Master 01:35:42 Oh, and it might have been, uh, Leopold. They got them then. Okay. Uh, then if, uh, end of your turn, it'll be ratchet. He'll make a death save.
Kaladin Shash 01:36:01 Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:36:13 Just roll it. 19 on the die. He's got one success. Top of the round layer action. I'll roll the D4 just to make it quick. One divine beam. Everybody go ahead and roll a D20.
Kaladin Shash 01:36:35 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:36:41 I'm dead, so... I should hopefully get it again. Damn it. 17.
Dungeon Master 01:36:44 Again, yeah, it'd be nice if you got 17. Roll 18, 19, 20. I'll have Ratchet roll it too, just to make it fair. Here with the 14. Okay, Leopold, what's yours? Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:37:06 Yeah. All right. Okay, perfect.
Leopold Magnus 01:37:09 My, oh, my D20. Hey, natural 20. Is it a bonus, as a bonus action, an item interaction?
Dungeon Master 01:37:18 Nice OK that means Paladin you are blind in your next turn only. Leopold your turn. Object interaction is. Free, but it depends on what you're using.
Leopold Magnus 01:37:44 I was going to use a healing syringe and hit Ratchet here with it. Okay, yeah, so I'll hit Ratchet with one syringe and then since Daryl here is 30 feet away, I'll run over and hit him with my second one because I have two since we got that extra at the start of the mission. Oh, I see.
Dungeon Master 01:37:51 Yeah, that's fine. One of them is self only. You don't get two that you can use on other people.
Leopold Magnus 01:38:15 OK. So Ratchet saved one death save, right? Saved, saved, failed. Got it. Right.
Dungeon Master 01:38:23 Yeah, so Ratchet is 1-0, Zariel is 2-1. Yeah. So in theory, Jesse could roll a Nat 1 and die, but he's more likely to succeed. Ratchet, even if he rolls a Nat 1, won't die this round, no matter what. Yes. A DC 10 medicine check.
Leopold Magnus 01:38:42 Okay. Uh, well actually can't, can I stabilize somebody with an action? Okay. I will stabilize ratchet, uh, with a medicine check. Oh, for fuck's sake. Yeah, I'm
Dungeon Master 01:38:54 Okay, give me a medicine pick. Does not work. Would you like to use your bonus action on him still?
Zariel Torgan 01:39:00 Eh, eh, eh, eh
Kaladin Shash 01:39:03 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 01:39:05 Hang in there, Donnie! Oh, I'm slapping around, and his head is flipping from left to right with significant force. You might actually think I did more damage than help. No, I'm just gonna drop him, and I'm gonna be like, you know, kind of, oh god, oh god, ratshit, figure it out! And I'm gonna run over to Azariel. And him with a syringe.
Leopold Magnus 01:39:33 as my bonus action, I guess. Or you said that was just free, depending. Okay, so yeah. Okay, yeah, I'll hit it. I'll hit Xario with it. You want me to roll that then?
Dungeon Master 01:39:39 Bonus. Something like healing at minimum is supposed to be an action on somebody, but I'll say the syringes can be bonus actions. Okay, go ahead and roll 2d4 plus 2. Yep, you're doing it. Sick.
Kaladin Shash 01:39:52 Just a little.
Leopold Magnus 01:40:04 Okay, it takes six heals. You're back in the fight, Zario. Well, that's kind of your hallmark. And that right there is my turn. Hopefully, hopefully Donnie makes it.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:08 Nice. Again, whiplash.
Dungeon Master 01:40:19 Sylverus. Perfect. While all that's happening, I'll quickly roll for Sylverus to do his three things. Hits. Hits. Hit. Easy.
Kaladin Shash 01:40:32 Better.
Dungeon Master 01:40:47 That'll be slash R 66 plus 15. I think it kills him no matter what. By one point. 31 HP left. He does 32 points of damage.
Kaladin Shash 01:41:03 Oh man.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:05 Ha ha ha ha ha.
Dungeon Master 01:41:10 You see Sylvaris sprints in, just heavy breath. He's still bloody. He's less than half total HP, even though he's pretty strong.
Dungeon Master 01:41:18 runs in and just, even though it's three attacks, you see him jump at this sort of divine, decrepit, like, cursed creature, and his huge sword just embeds through its chest as they both fall to the ground. And you see he rolls off the side, his sword still sitting in its chest, just heavy breathing, you see his chest plate rising and falling, and he just goes to that side, he's like,
Dungeon Master 01:41:49 All right, guys. That was. That was pretty intense. And he's very casually on the ground. My other friends didn't make it. They died in the tunnel.
Kaladin Shash 01:42:05 Hey, laser. Watch out.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:08 Oh, shit.
Leopold Magnus 01:42:10 Oh, oh, oh. Did Sunseeker pass? Who was it? Laser, Blazer, Sunseeker, or Blazer? Okay, I thought all four of them looked the same. Got it. I see, okay.
Dungeon Master 01:42:20 You know that this is Sylvarius Sunseeker. This is the main guy. Again, it was one dude who looked like a total douche and then three just like triplet-looking identical copies that are like... No, it's the obvious leader of the pack and then his three groupies. He sees this, breathing heavy, he goes, yeah, so we got to the temple you guys told us to go to and as soon as we opened the door it was super quiet and then we're like,
Dungeon Master 01:42:49 We're walking down the main hall and all the doors locked around us. And then we were fucking like descended upon by all these fucking guys. Uh, and then we like killed them initially. And we're like, Oh shit, well we're supposed to go down the tunnel and meet you guys. But every fucking step of the way, there was just a bunch of them. Thanks. Um,
Kaladin Shash 01:42:58 Time to go.
Leopold Magnus 01:43:12 Well, good to see you're on One Piece, Sunseeker. Is there perhaps maybe open positions on the squad?
Dungeon Master 01:43:23 What? He passes up on it. Did somebody bring Ratchet up? OK, so one pass, one fail, and then one pass, OK. I see that, yeah. Stabilized. Do you do anything in particular?
Zariel Torgan 01:43:24 I rolled a seven medicine check and then I rolled I rolled Does that mean he's conscious or unconscious
Kaladin Shash 01:43:41 Does anyone have any means to heal him?
Dungeon Master 01:43:51 He is, I actually believe he is unconscious for 1d4 minutes, or hours. If it's stabilized and not brought up with a potion. He will be unconscious for 3 hours. Normally it just ups him, but he is no longer at 0, he's at 1, but healing him won't bring him back to consciousness, he's out.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:07 Yeah, I'll just hit him. Oh. Oh, OK, we'll take back that. OK, all right.
Kaladin Shash 01:44:17 Okay, she's out no matter what three minutes.
Dungeon Master 01:44:19 That's sort of, yeah, it's the drawback of doing something free to save somebody's life is they lose, like, in-game time. So don't worry about sending that spell, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, keep that slot. Any order you guys want to do something real quick, because otherwise we'll keep things moving.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:44 I'm good. Let's do it.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:45 So, I guess just in terms of what's left behind on the reverend's body, did he disintegrate? Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:44:52 No, he's you see he's got this like it's not actually metallic but it almost looks like a gold metallic dust of skin like it's
Kaladin Shash 01:44:53 I mean.
Dungeon Master 01:45:02 Just like textured, it's a little reflective. It's got a sheen to it, but it is very much skin. Muscular toned body. He's like nine feet tall. Again, it's humanoid, but he's not human. It's like this species of angelic creature. Don't know what it's doing here. You don't know anything behind it.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:20 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:45:23 But you had sort of narrated blowing him apart a little bit in the chest. So he's got this like gaping hole where he's got this like gold blood seeping into the ground. At his side is the sword that again went from being this like enormous metallic great sword that sort of the pieces think of like Narsil from Lord of the Rings like there's like six distinct pieces that fit together for a blade.
Dungeon Master 01:45:49 It's like that, but they constantly look like that, but they hold together. When he dropped it, it turned to looking more like stained glass. Still up and still cool, just not what it was. But that's all there is to him.
Leopold Magnus 01:46:03 Interesting. Go ahead, Colin.
Kaladin Shash 01:46:04 Do I still see Zariel's metal under skin, rope, muscles, or whatever? Oh, 100%.
Dungeon Master 01:46:18 Do you take a second to look at him? Yeah, I mean, there's blood and it's bloody wounds, but when he moves a certain way anytime, like he hits like an extreme of his range of motion, full scaption of the shoulder blades, you see like a gash on his chest open up and like deep into it is like a sheen of like polished aluminum level brightness, like just a glint of metal.
Kaladin Shash 01:46:45 managing like Colossus is like skin. Right? Okay. Okay. That's strange. Okay. All right. Can I get on? Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Yeah. Can I get on the comms? It's
Dungeon Master 01:46:49 Yes, but underneath a fleshy suit You're like Yeah, I was gonna say you're entranced and you're watching him and then as you go to get on the comms it rings out and you hear Uh fellas, where's that? I need an update. I made it to the bay
Zariel Torgan 01:46:49 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 01:46:56 It's like the Terminator.
Kaladin Shash 01:47:15 Well, that was fast. So he got back to the core in a minute. I believe that was fast. I like that. OK. The problem has been neutralized.
Dungeon Master 01:47:19 It's been like damn near over 10 rounds since you guys talked to him. Levi's fast. Glad to hear. We'll get it all in the debrief. I don't think we're out of this yet. From what I can tell, my boys are wrapping things up.
Dungeon Master 01:47:45 on the street but uh whoever attacked the medbay they got away they they made it out of some tunnel real quick um cow i'm sorry but this this woman she's she's made of stone right now they they took the mask and ran i don't i don't know i don't know that shit uh but like i keep your eyes out they got through these tunnels and i'm thinking they're heading one way and that's your way
Kaladin Shash 01:48:02 She's like she's petrified. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:48:18 Pursue or head back, it's up to you. For now, it seems like the worst of it's ended, especially if you've taken out the source. You hear a question mark hang on the end of that. 10-4, I'll get back to you on that one.
Kaladin Shash 01:48:33 We took the leader, I don't know if he's the source of the mist. Do your people see anything from the roofs?
Dungeon Master 01:48:46 10 seconds later, he goes, yeah, slowly. It's still there, but it doesn't seem to be permeating outward like you guys had described before. Yeah, go for it.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:58 Hmm. While this is going on, can I take a second to just look around the room, see if there's anything that looks interesting? I just want to scan. I don't want to, like, go through everything. It's a natural 20 for a 26.
Leopold Magnus 01:49:11 And I was going to take a sample of the Reverend's blood.
Dungeon Master 01:49:21 I love this. Nobody else sees this. Zariel having cast fairy fire earlier. We'll say that it's like, even though technically dispelled, like traces of that purple magic hang on the ground and you're sort of looking down at the body of this celestial and you're the lenses that you didn't know you had in your, like,
Dungeon Master 01:49:51 optics sort of glitch out a second and it sort of shows you and you don't know what but like different a different perspective and you see footsteps very obviously holding space in the fairy fire you sort of go back to normal vision and there is nothing standing there you focus again you can swear that you see something standing just like right here just right on the staircase
Dungeon Master 01:50:21 But you look up, you don't see it. You use, if you've got night vision, you can't see it. Or dark vision, you can't see it. And you use all these magical senses, and there's nothing there. But you swear on the gods that through a very specific perspective, there is a pair of footprints standing on that staircase.
Zariel Torgan 01:50:48 Is it the kind of thing that I think that if I used another Faerie Fire that I might be able to see someone? Or does it feel like it's different than that? Like it's that sort of magic that we couldn't define. I really don't have very many spells left. I'm going to shoot a Faerie Fire over there. That's going to be a dex 14 saving throw.
Dungeon Master 01:51:01 That's a call for you to make. I'm going to roll this to myself.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:18 Just gonna, I'm gonna point a hand out and I'm gonna say, show yourself. I'll just be like, I was really confident with that and so I'll just kind of be like, oh, maybe not.
Dungeon Master 01:51:31 Okay, I rolled a natural 20. You see, you shoot it again, and whatever you see or saw or swear to have seen, maybe caught notice of detection, and you shoot it again, and the space that the fairy fire fills,
Dungeon Master 01:51:59 encapsulates where those sort of footprints were. Nothing there. And with that disappearance of those footsteps, that sort of underlying off sensation that had been sort of plaguing your senses since you got here lifts. It's just sort of an old temple blessed by a forgotten god.
Kaladin Shash 01:52:05 Jonathan, can I do a perception check? Do I smell anything in particular?
Dungeon Master 01:52:31 Give me another perception. You can do it advantage if you're based off a smelt. No, at this point, whatever you had smelt before is gone.
Kaladin Shash 01:52:36 Yeah. Let me get my sheet. That's a terrible, terrible 10. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:52:41 advantage because it's based off of smell. So did we get the impression from that communication that
Leopold Magnus 01:52:46 Yeah, that's a good observation.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:12 The people that took that mask for that woman are heading towards us, and we can either wait to engage or recuperate. Or did we get the impression that they were just fleeing there through a system of tunnels that we could meet and have an interaction?
Kaladin Shash 01:53:30 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:53:30 You can make an intuition as a player for your character or I can make you roll like an intelligence check and tell you what I think you would have figured out. Up to you.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:43 Uh, it doesn't seem like they'd be coming here. I wouldn't think that that would make sense. Because they know the guy's dead. I mean, they're getting their power from this guy, so they'd probably be off hiding somewhere. So. Well, uh, well, uh, well, what do you guys think? Do you wanna pursue a bit, or, uh, rest up and reconfigure our plan?
Leopold Magnus 01:54:16 Well, Azariel, I'm pretty spent, to be honest, but I'd hate to let our assailants go.
Kaladin Shash 01:54:17 Yes, I feel like we need to do something about this. I've got no health. I've got no spells left. We need to rest or we at least need to heal if we're going to try to do something.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:47 Yes, I think you boys are correct. I think perhaps we head back, get a bit more information on the other groups, perhaps get some sort of equipment from our little lottery doodad, and then hit it hard.
Kaladin Shash 01:54:57 Do we know where they're going? Like what tunnels they've exited through? Or are we just assuming they're on our way to us right now? Like if we rest, will we have chance to do this or not?
Zariel Torgan 01:55:24 Can I, Jonathan, as a player that worked in the core and is pretty familiar with those tunnels, does it seem like the tunnels that they're talking about outside of the sick bay would meet up with these types of tunnels? Or are those just totally different types of tunnels?
Kaladin Shash 01:55:26 Okay. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:55:31 Mm hmm. It's entirely possible, you know, for the most part, something that far out would be really, like really winding and tortuous to get through. It's like a very complicated system that sort of built on itself over time. But
Dungeon Master 01:56:00 You also know from what you've seen that these cultists have been underground digging out areas for quite a while too. They could have connected tunnels with nobody noticing over time. So they could have, in theory, dug a straight shot, essentially.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:17 All right. At a game, do you guys want to just start a short rest? And if they show up, we do what we can. If we have to flee, we flee. Or do you want to just go back and take a long rest and then hope we can pick up the trail? OK.
Kaladin Shash 01:56:24 I'm okay short resting for now. It's an easy action to start with, and if they don't show in the next whatever, we can head back to the core. I don't know what we do to track them.
Leopold Magnus 01:56:39 Yeah. I would say at a minimum, we take a short rest and
Zariel Torgan 01:56:46 I think our best bet would be for me to go into wolf form or something and try to use survival or something like that to track them through the tunnels outside of where they took from the girl.
Leopold Magnus 01:57:06 I would even lean towards a long rest and tracking them early in the morning because I think you've used both of your druid forms, right? Oh, I see. OK, so that's beneficial. I. Yeah, I have no spell slots, but with the one level wizard, I think I can get once per long rest, I can do arcane recovery, right? Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:15 Yeah, but I get everything except my spell slots back on a short rest. So...
Kaladin Shash 01:57:19 Yeah. Shortness really just gets me hit points. That's all it's getting me. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:57:21 Circle a moon. Get back to first level.
Leopold Magnus 01:57:35 And I get one, so I can, I can get one level first level spell slot. Yeah, that's it. That would be all I have. Use cantrips.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:43 Well, let's wait and do the short rest. And if they show up, we'll try to be scrappy and I'll have a lot of hit points to beat the tank. And you guys can kind of, you know, try to be strategic. Yeah. And then, you know, I kind of don't think they're going to show up, but let's, let's give it a shot.
Leopold Magnus 01:58:05 Yeah, I do.
Kaladin Shash 01:58:05 So that's fine. Start a short rest. Jonathan, do you mechanically, do you make these a half hour for us or are they full hours? Okay, sweet.
Dungeon Master 01:58:12 Half hour.
Zariel Torgan 01:58:16 I think we should probably try to be a little more clandestine here and maybe hide. I don't know if there's anywhere to hide, but at least tuck behind something. That way, if some people run in, they can't just see us and immediately shoot us.
Kaladin Shash 01:58:38 Y'all hide behind the coffins, because we're waiting for people to pop out where Sunseeker came out. Yes, let us hide. This is this is what cowards do. We will do it for you, Zario.
Zariel Torgan 01:58:45 Yeah, I would think it would be that way, wouldn't it? All right. I appreciate it.
Dungeon Master 01:58:46 Let's hear something. You see Silvera pushes up into like a plank, puts his knee down and stands lowly. He looks at you guys, he goes, no offense, but like, even as I am, I think I'm stronger than all of you.
Dungeon Master 01:59:15 If it's fucking righteous with y'all, I'm gonna take old CO over here and take him back to the core. Yeah, commanding officer. He'll evacuate him from the space, because half hour in, he's got two and a half hours of unconsciousness. Silverius has like 68 hit points still. He would probably be fine making it back to the core.
Kaladin Shash 01:59:25 See, I was going to take Ratchet. We've got three hours of it. Let's find you have any syringes.
Dungeon Master 01:59:49 Yeah, I've got ways to heal myself too. Just hadn't come to that. I'll be fine. Just are you guys going to be okay without us? All right. All righty, dude. We're having a great fight. Throws him over his shoulder and just like stumble, walk slowly through the way that you guys came in. So he'll take the main path that you guys know are clear.
Kaladin Shash 01:59:59 We'll make it. Don't worry.
Dungeon Master 02:00:16 uh to the main chapel to the main road down to the core uh everybody give me a stealth check
Zariel Torgan 02:00:28 All right, I'll hide, put it right here, like there. This is gonna go really well, you guys. 21.
Kaladin Shash 02:00:36 Silence.
Leopold Magnus 02:00:59 17.
Dungeon Master 02:01:05 One more. 18, you guys adeptly tuck yourselves away. You wait and wait patiently, holding your breath when you feel necessary. After 30 minutes, nothing happens. You guys are uninterrupted.
Kaladin Shash 02:01:21 Silence.
Zariel Torgan 02:01:30 Hmm. Well, what do you guys think? You want to just head back? All right, I think you're right.
Leopold Magnus 02:01:49 Yes, Dariel, I think it might be time. We need to regroup.
Dungeon Master 02:01:56 I'm just putting the dice away. Don't worry about that.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:04 I need to roll my hit dice real quick.
Kaladin Shash 02:02:10 In that 30 minutes, would we have gotten any communications?
Dungeon Master 02:02:18 You hear general talk between Captain Levi and his soldiers asking for updates. There were a couple guards killed, a couple legionnaire at the core. Once they had come through the specific tunnel, there wasn't a lot of people manned there, which is probably why they chose it. One of the med techs who was supervising it during the night, because this was the middle of the night,
Dungeon Master 02:02:41 One of them lost their lives. A woman was hiding underneath a desk and managed to survive, giving a report of what the main suspects looked like. Through all of that, it was pretty easy to deduce that the main person leading the attack on the med bay was Cedric, but that he had gotten away.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:02 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 02:03:03 A bastard.
Dungeon Master 02:03:06 Other than that, they just do like you just hear general updates of like, were people hurt in the town any beyond, you know, healing, getting supplies run out, you know, the Legionnaire does a really good job of taking care of the citizens and events like this.
Dungeon Master 02:03:22 So, like, you're just listening first-hand, too, because, again, your runes were modified for this mission specifically to have, like, direct contact to the Core, but right now you're hearing all of the communication of, like, the emergency relief that the Core does. Just, like, low audio threshold constantly going off as you guys are in this space. But nothing else specifically targeted to you.
Kaladin Shash 02:03:32 Yeah, now we're now we're hunting for Cedric potentially or some lead on
Zariel Torgan 02:03:47 What do you guys say? Head back and, uh, reap our rewards and do a little planning? Yeah, we gotta fuck that guy up. Basically killed the girl, or, well...
Leopold Magnus 02:04:01 Yeah. Yeah. Stole, stole the girl, ran off with her. No, no, stole the mask.
Kaladin Shash 02:04:02 What happened? Yeah, we can go back to the core. Well, sold the mask, but. Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:04:20 All right. Yeah, I guess we head back then. That works for me.
Kaladin Shash 02:04:32 Do we have, do we understand that both these tunnels just enter and exit through other parts of the temple, or do these tunnels lead to other parts of this section of the city? Yeah. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:04:43 The one at the top left leads you to the opposite side of the Dawn District. Like this one was that other temple you sent Sylvaris to. And like these other ones connect. You don't know really where they go. They just go off in distance. If you followed them eventually you could probably find your way back. But you know for sure this one leads to an abandoned temple on the other side of town. And the main one you guys went through leads to the main temple of Viteo.
Kaladin Shash 02:05:13 Okay. All right. We're just wondering if we had missed someone with invisibility, if they would have just continued on to their temple and then left or whatever. So maybe we should search other temples eventually. I don't know. Yeah, but then we, then we smelled, then I smelled flowers.
Leopold Magnus 02:05:33 Well, they exited from the med bay through the tunnels. Is that what we heard? Interesting. Right, right. No, no. Yeah, he definitely spotted something or someone, but we haven't.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:38 Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:05:43 And Zariel thought he potentially saw footprints with a perfect perception check, but he couldn't see invisibility. Well, so what I'm thinking is if
Dungeon Master 02:05:44 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 02:06:00 Uh, I mean, we could track Cedric probably through the med bay tunnels. Like we could just follow his footsteps. Right. Oh, I see. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:06:08 If Captain Levi got there that quickly to communicate to us at the exact end of the battle, and the nurse had already said someone's here, right, he could have easily gotten to where we were within that exact same time frame before he kept going through the... Yeah, so there's no point in trying to track him from the medbay.
Zariel Torgan 02:06:22 Yeah. He's probably on our side.
Dungeon Master 02:06:28 No check required, you realize that's exactly what you missed. At some point Cedric was around you guys, maybe not invisible, you don't know him to have that kind of power, but he had passed through, maybe saw that shit hit the fan on his end and he just kept going.
Kaladin Shash 02:06:46 Yeah. I love it.
Leopold Magnus 02:06:47 Yep, got it. That checks all the boxes.
Zariel Torgan 02:06:52 And he was just too shy to tell us. That's it. That's the twist. All right. Aw, damn it. Aw, damn it. Shit. Well, I guess, I don't know. Do you guys want to follow him through that other tunnel, or do you want to just head back?
Leopold Magnus 02:07:25 Yeah, I think we gotta go back. Like, I don't have enough to square off for another fight.
Kaladin Shash 02:07:28 Oh, we got nothing. We got nothing to scrap with, but yeah, I think if we were going to. It did take all of us to get rid of him. That's what it was. But at full blast. Yeah, I'd say if we don't try to track him right now, it's going to be a lot harder, but we're also very ill equipped to do it. Yeah. That's OK, yeah, we can go back. We can regroup.
Zariel Torgan 02:07:32 And we weren't strong enough to fight him when we were all full blast, so yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's a trade-off. It'll be harder, but we'll be in a better position.
Kaladin Shash 02:08:02 Oh.
Leopold Magnus 02:08:02 I'm gonna...
Zariel Torgan 02:08:04 All right. To the core.
Dungeon Master 02:08:06 OK. To the core. We'll just go to the bunks. OK. You wind up in the general common area after a long night.
Dungeon Master 02:08:36 nobody's really talked to zariel about what they've seen so far um i imagine as he sort of pulled his armor back into place and and like sort of got himself a little more presentable it wasn't quite as obvious of anything so it's not like other people are going to question it but you guys make your way back we'll say it's like one two in the morning at this point everything has been settled no more cultists are
Dungeon Master 02:09:03 trackable at this point they either got all of the rest of the ones in the streets or they fled into the darkness um you did check in ratchet um is like stable in the med bay being taken care of they were able to get him to consciousness after a while he's got like he's intubation tube at this moment so he's like not talking to anybody as he's being like fast track healed
Kaladin Shash 02:09:15 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:09:27 Silverius went off and did whatever he does on his normal nights. You've only ever seen him once before. But you guys sort of had this moment to yourselves.
Zariel Torgan 02:09:39 did, as a, just a curiosity, it's usually the perspective, the first person perspective, it's hard to see, like, inside, deep, like, shoulder and, like, wounds like that. Did I see that?
Dungeon Master 02:09:58 I had initially described some of them as being in spots that you would have, but I want this to be up to you. They definitely notice them, but whether or not you as a player or character have seen them yet, I want that to be sort of your call.
Zariel Torgan 02:10:18 I'm going to roll this d20. I definitely saw something that freaked me out. I'm just not going to investigate it. I'm going to leave it alone, because I'm scared to look into it. Because I know that I underwent some sort of serious surgery, and I never really asked any questions. So I'm just going to like, yeah, I'm just going to not go into it. So, OK.
Kaladin Shash 02:10:25 Okay.
Kaladin Shash 02:10:58 Oh, no, I got nothing.
Dungeon Master 02:10:58 OK. Anybody else have something specific before you guys take a long rest? It is like 1, 1.30 in the morning.
Leopold Magnus 02:11:11 Yeah, it's pretty early in the day still. Oh, OK, yeah. No, I'm going to hit the hay.
Dungeon Master 02:11:27 OK. Between Kaladin and Zariel, who wants to have their little dream sequence first?
Zariel Torgan 02:11:29 Yep, same here. I've already had a couple from dying, so it's probably Kaladin's turn.
Kaladin Shash 02:11:46 All right, I'll take it. This is good.
Dungeon Master 02:11:55 Uh, sleep comes quickly to you on this night, specifically after everything you guys have been through at first, nothing blackness. Then you find yourself in a moment in that same space as before the sheer fabric octagon, essentially that surrounds you in the small space.
Dungeon Master 02:12:24 void of any sound or sight beyond that you can just tell there's like some film in front of you all you hear are footsteps just in unison just just around you fade out of consciousness you come back into it and you smell flowers
Kaladin Shash 02:12:45 Silence.
Dungeon Master 02:12:52 You lift your head, you're in a field. Golden amber wheat as far as you can see. Rise to your knees, you hear the crunching of it underneath your weight as you displace it. Sit back onto your feet, knees down, sort of kneeling. You hear some laughter. You can't see anything beyond the wheat, you just hear it in the distance. What you hear is just the talk of one day we'll be
Dungeon Master 02:13:21 rulers of these lands. You and I, just like we talked about. Wouldn't that be the day you think we could do it? They say one of us is special. Not sure which one. Probably me. Laughter. And then stumble forward out of consciousness again. And when you awake, it is the morning. But before we get to that. It'll be Sauriel.
Kaladin Shash 02:13:28 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:13:52 Zaria, you latch onto this newly unlocked memory, vision, something. You are standing guard at this doorway of this immaculate room, this mage looking out the window, staring into the distance. Your eyes focus a little bit differently. You're in this beautiful city.
Dungeon Master 02:14:18 of copper buildings that rise up on the cliffside. Not an area you're familiar with. You don't know what this is. This time you hear the figure speak. It goes, I don't know what to do. I need more. I know the answer, but can I pull through with it? How do you know you're just a robot? Is she worth
Kaladin Shash 02:14:41 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:14:48 The cost. That is the question we face now, isn't it? Your vision fades. You wake up in the morning, everybody has complete their long rest. I'm sorry, was there something else? Did you guys just level up?
Zariel Torgan 02:15:05 And... I'm just giving you a little taste of your own medicine. It feels like it's been like a month and a half since we leveled up last. Oh, that's funny. Oh, Jesus.
Dungeon Master 02:15:19 I like it, OK? Well, that's because we've had two sessions. Do a little bit more, I'll level you up.
Kaladin Shash 02:15:25 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:15:36 I'm just gonna be in a cold sweat and then confused about the cold sweat and just very jittery. Yeah, I'm not a great actor.
Leopold Magnus 02:15:51 Uh, it's pretty noticeable I imagine. Yeah. Zario, um, buddy, are you doing okay there? Well, what's on your, what's on your mind?
Zariel Torgan 02:16:05 No, I'm not. Something. I don't even know how to talk about this. There may or may not be a chance that we're a lot more similar than I thought we were.
Kaladin Shash 02:16:13 You're welcome.
Leopold Magnus 02:16:37 Is that so? Well, that's that's quite interesting and novel. What makes you say that, Zario?
Zariel Torgan 02:16:43 Somehow, I think yes. All right, I'm going to look around. Is there anybody else in our proximity? We're not near one of those cameras, are we? OK.
Dungeon Master 02:17:02 No, you guys are sort of, um, you're posted up at like the corner of the room intentionally. So nothing that you're aware of. Uh, you see that like he has been healing. Yes. He's got like some,
Kaladin Shash 02:17:04 Did his wounds heal or does it just look like some sort of makeup skin? Okay, okay.
Dungeon Master 02:17:29 indentations of where wounds were but like for the most part his body's like healing in the sense that you guys are in a magical arcane time and that kind of stuff exists.
Kaladin Shash 02:17:39 Right, right, right. Yes.
Zariel Torgan 02:17:41 Mm-hmm. Well, you guys know how I had been through a major accident, and I didn't have a lot of my memory because of this accident when I was working in the Corps. Well, it,
Zariel Torgan 02:18:06 It would seem as if, to be honest, I had noticed a couple little things recently that made me think maybe I had some sort of enhancements, magical or otherwise. I don't know if you guys noticed during that fight that I had some sort of inorganic material that I thought was some sort of synthetic enhancement.
Zariel Torgan 02:18:37 I don't know, did you guys see anything like that? Yeah, I thought it might be like a Wolverine type thing, but it's, I had a dream, and this guy called me a robot, and I'm having a lot of trouble wrapping my head around that right now.
Kaladin Shash 02:18:41 I saw this. I saw what you spoke of. You are like made of metal, your bones.
Leopold Magnus 02:19:06 Yeah, I'll lean in and I'll go, Zario, what's a robot?
Zariel Torgan 02:19:06 Not sure how that works. When a mommy robot and daddy robot really like each other. Well, I guess you're technically a construct.
Kaladin Shash 02:19:27 Bye-bye.
Zariel Torgan 02:19:34 I think you're held together with magic and I think I'm held together with things people made with their smarts and probably a little bit of magic but I'm not really sure. I need to do some research.
Zariel Torgan 02:19:57 That might not even be true. I mean, we don't know. Just because you have a memory from a dream doesn't mean it's real. It could have been somebody else's memory. I mean, we don't know any of this, so it shouldn't act rash.
Kaladin Shash 02:19:58 I'm talking to.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:13 Oh dear, Zario. Sounds like you have quite the trouble on your hands. Maybe we should go down and see Hamhawk. They might have some insights.
Zariel Torgan 02:20:25 Well, between the two of you and me and the three of us, I might try to keep this one under our hat. I don't much like to tell people my personal business, and this seems like the sort of thing that might have greater implications than we might be aware of.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:46 Oh yes, of course. Boy Scouts oath. I won't tell anyone.
Kaladin Shash 02:20:47 Silence. Silence.
Zariel Torgan 02:20:51 Much appreciated, Leo. I know I count on you and Kaladin here to get me through this emotionally turbid time. But enough about me, even though my life is shattered. How you guys doing?
Kaladin Shash 02:21:18 We live. You always you always have something to say, Leopold. Good, that's good. What?
Zariel Torgan 02:21:20 How are you guys doing? What?
Dungeon Master 02:21:24 The PTSD is real.
Leopold Magnus 02:21:29 Oh, oh me? No, I just kind of powered down in this corner here. I didn't really have anything going on at all. I did see you eat a spider though, Kaladin. You had an early breakfast. While I was sitting there in sentry mode, you know, I don't have anything else to do, so I was just kind of watching a spider. It crawled around on your forehead.
Kaladin Shash 02:21:51 I'll give him a call.
Dungeon Master 02:21:55 What an absurd thing to say.
Leopold Magnus 02:21:56 Then it went in your nose. It's quite entertaining. And then you finally did eat it, so.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:10 Yeah. They, you know, they say you eat 20 of those a year, but I don't believe it. Leo, are you, are you helping this situation happen? Are you finding spiders and putting them on people?
Leopold Magnus 02:22:16 Well, well, let me tell you, Zario, I don't sleep. I just kind of sit here and watch other people sleep, which it sounds weird when you think about it, but I can tell you from fact that people do eat at least 20 spiders.
Kaladin Shash 02:22:30 Quite comforting, yes. Very, very good.
Dungeon Master 02:22:31 I can't believe it.
Leopold Magnus 02:22:40 Well, no, and my head spins around, stares up in the corner, and I just spin back around and say, have you taken a look at these accommodations? They're quite, well, to be honest, dusty and well infiltrated by the eight-legged arachnid.
Dungeon Master 02:23:03 Did you just make it canon that the core has a lot of spiders? You just made it canon that the core has a lot of spiders. That's just a generic map. Don't do that. You dare to be a spider.
Leopold Magnus 02:23:06 Well, I just imagine that, you know, this is like a wood building. It's kind of old, right? Maybe the loose, loose fitting windows. It seems like it would fit. The floors are kind of broken up. I don't know. I mean, maybe I'm reading into the map too much.
Zariel Torgan 02:23:13 The floors. Yeah, all those dots, all those dots that look like nails, those are just spiders on the floor.
Kaladin Shash 02:23:16 Yep. Oh. The birds are pristine.
Leopold Magnus 02:23:35 Yep. Yep. Leopold just watches people sleep. See, he does have the numbers.
Dungeon Master 02:23:37 Oh And while i'm writing that down
Kaladin Shash 02:23:49 So we've woken up, who, if Hamhawk's down, who do we report to or who can we talk to about trying to pursue anything about the mask?
Zariel Torgan 02:23:50 Well, I imagine we got to go touch base with Ratshit now that it's the morning. He's probably up, right?
Leopold Magnus 02:24:19 Yeah, I would assume so. He's only down for like two or three hours.
Kaladin Shash 02:24:21 That's right. OK. He's up. Yeah, let's do the little.
Zariel Torgan 02:24:22 Yeah, when we left him last night, he was like intubated at like 1.30 or 2, and now it's like eight hours later or so. I would imagine that we could hit him up and then meet up.
Dungeon Master 02:24:43 Do you do that? You guys are desperate, but you didn't even use the items you got last time.
Kaladin Shash 02:24:45 Yeah, let's go ahead and do that. I don't know what our next step would be. At least they can give us some sort of intel. Maybe we can go back there again and try to follow one of the tunnels or something. Oh, yeah. I think that's a wise choice. I was trying to think of a good use of the ring.
Zariel Torgan 02:24:55 I think I'd like to hit up that lotto before we go, too. Just since we've completed that mission, I might get some fuel. I did.
Kaladin Shash 02:25:13 I've got a couple of good words ready to use, but they just did not fit in battle. I like the mechanics of the ring.
Dungeon Master 02:25:19 OK. Oh, right. OK. OK.
Leopold Magnus 02:25:21 I think the problem is I used my coin and we hadn't long rested for like a really long time. I don't remember what I used it for, but I did use it.
Dungeon Master 02:25:32 I remember either. Yeah, you guys get your breakfast and it's a little bit of a later morning because you went to sleep a little bit later. But when you wake, you sort of ask around and eventually are directed to one of the meeting rooms. And as you walk in, you see first as you sort of open and into the doorway, ratchets hunched over the table, reading over some tunnel systems. He looks.
Dungeon Master 02:25:56 Very in focus and one of his arms is in a sling from where like his shoulder had been blown out it's been like repair but you can tell you doesn't have great use of it at this moment. I look up and it goes martin to hell and i had what you say. And to his left at the other end of the table you see captain levi looks totally fine.
Dungeon Master 02:26:22 Um a little tired maybe but like no physical injuries. You can tell he's a pretty accomplished fighter. Um he goes he's like drinking some coffee. Holds his cup up to you. He goes uh that's **** damn right. Uh what a hell of a night we had. I haven't had to move that fast and I **** tell you how long. Let's uh let's not waste
Dungeon Master 02:26:49 Left to right. Zariel to Kaladin. I want a debrief. What did you guys encounter? What happened? How long? Injuries? Deaths? What's the update? His left to your right. That's why I said Zariel to Kaladin.
Zariel Torgan 02:27:03 Did he say left to right? Is that his left? Oh, gotcha. Yeah, well, real quick, can I look at the two of them as I start talking and get a feel for whether or not they think anything's off with me? Well, I don't want that.
Kaladin Shash 02:27:06 This is our community. You put it out there. He has to tell you now.
Dungeon Master 02:27:24 I can roll to see if they think anything is off with you. Well, it's what you just asked. Give me deception or performance check.
Zariel Torgan 02:27:35 Dammit, I wanted to just roll inside. What? I didn't mean emotionally, I meant whether or not he saw my, like, undergarments when we were fighting, and I wanted to know if he knew it.
Kaladin Shash 02:27:38 Ha ha ha ha!
Dungeon Master 02:28:01 Oh, Ratchet was unconscious for most of that fight. He didn't notice anything, but in this moment, are you acting weird? That's not a big enough difference. That's pretty close. I think he can tell you're a little rocked.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:04 Okay, alright. I can still... I'm a little cagey, but that's normal. So 15 down to 14.
Dungeon Master 02:28:19 Um, if we just thought about this very logically, you guys are newer recruits and this was like a huge scale fight that just took place in one of the six major districts have been the mega city that like was an all out mini war last night.
Dungeon Master 02:28:36 anybody would be shooken up from that. So he looks at PCs, you see like a little bit of compassion in his eyes, it's like maybe he really gets it. And then he sort of shifts his focus back down to his like documents as he is in the meeting, but he wasn't the one who just asked you a question. So he like doesn't butt in or anything.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:38 All right. Well, I'll just say my little piece. Well, I'll keep it short since I'm not the speaker for our group here.
Zariel Torgan 02:29:04 Uh, we followed off on a lead that we told you about. Um, we were concerned that it was going to be much larger scale than we had seen. And based on what Kaladin had told you, it seems like he was correct in our assumption that it was large scale. We proceeded to the tunnels. We fought a, uh, recently upgraded.
Kaladin Shash 02:29:06 I'll see you.
Zariel Torgan 02:29:33 old man and I was killed about five times. I don't remember much from this. I was unconscious a lot. That's all I have.
Kaladin Shash 02:29:40 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:29:51 He's taking quick hand, just like shorthand notes. He doesn't have a lot of magical progress, but he's like documenting everything you said. He looks up in the middle at Leopold.
Leopold Magnus 02:30:01 Well, executed straight to plan, we entered into lair number four here, I project up on my hollow. Diving into the catacombs, we found three, and Leopold continues to give an excruciatingly detailed summary of step-by-step combat for each character, the enemies they fell towards the end, you hear him, at which point I ingested a large stone, about this big,
Leopold Magnus 02:30:31 I kind of reached down, pull another one out, show it around. Towards the evil reverend blowing a clean hole straight through his sternum. It was then that we departed and you were resuscitated by Sunseeker and we took a short rest in the cave waiting further action.
Dungeon Master 02:30:55 He's jotting everything down. You see his hand like cramping. He shakes it out a couple times. He's trying to keep up. So you mentioned the sort of like hallucinogenic liquids you found and all that too? There's a...
Leopold Magnus 02:31:05 Yeah, exactly. And how the mouse reacted to the liquid after a certain amount of time. How the reverend transformed from the old priest.
Dungeon Master 02:31:21 You see they're taking notes and then Levi looks up at Ratchet, Donnie, and he goes, let's send somebody out to get a sample of whatever they found in that mausoleum, that liquid. And he goes, and he just transformed, huh? I mean, manifestation of curses is pretty well documented. Usually it's, you know, push to the edge kind of moment. This seems
Kaladin Shash 02:31:26 I mean.
Dungeon Master 02:31:48 different. It seems like that's what he was and then he was just hiding. Would you agree? Something's not right.
Leopold Magnus 02:31:55 Why, yes, he did look like it was his natural-born form, but I'm not one to say, what did you think, Kaladin?
Kaladin Shash 02:32:05 Yes, my companions have described the situation very well. His body may have been some sort of manifestation. It did not arise from anything else, and his soul disappeared when he was done.
Dungeon Master 02:32:30 Did you take the weapon or did you leave it at the scene? Reminder is that there was a weapon, it just changed the way it looked. So it's up to you guys if you took it or not. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:32:33 There was no weapon afterwards. It disintegrated. It just dulled out. That's right.
Dungeon Master 02:32:47 It went from being basically like a greatsword to a longsword and the blade went from being metal material to stained glass. So like every shard is a different color but it still forms out a blade. You didn't say you grabbed it.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:03 Oh, did we leave that there? Oh. Is it too late to say that we just would have grabbed it up, or do we need to go back for it? I think I have a backpack.
Kaladin Shash 02:33:03 Yeah. I didn't know we could grab it. I thought it. I thought it just went back to just glass. I didn't understand that.
Dungeon Master 02:33:20 You can say you grabbed it. Who has it? Who has it and did you bring it? It is a long sword, so it's not like you can just, you know, stash it like that. No, like I said, I tried to explain it. I don't have to, like, draw something. I didn't have a good image. Like, imagine
Kaladin Shash 02:33:34 I feel like. Yeah, I feel like that. No, I like it. He described the edge. Shards
Zariel Torgan 02:33:36 Oh, I thought it was in pieces. Mm-hmm. Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:33:47 Imagine a sword perfectly shaped, but instead of being attached at certain points, it looks like the blade shattered like glass, but it's held perfectly in place. There's just a gap where there was once a connection. So as the sword was swinging around, the pieces weren't connected to each other at all the places, but it still made contact as if it was solid. The explosion of energy came like if it was solid. It is just like a blade locked in a gravitational state.
Dungeon Master 02:34:15 where the material doesn't move farther or closer away together it's just like this odd weapon there like the pieces hang there reflecting the stained glass that he sort of burst through and again it is a long sword so you either brought it and it's obviously on your back wrapped up or something or you stashed it and you did not bring it with you
Kaladin Shash 02:34:20 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:34:30 Well that I that's too fancy for me to be hanging on to so probably with one of you guys
Kaladin Shash 02:34:50 I'll say it's still, I'll say I'm carrying it, it's on my back. Is that fine? Do they want to see the sword? That's fine, I won't.
Dungeon Master 02:34:54 OK. You don't have to say that's what you have on your back. You don't have to be that specific. Yes. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:06 If we would have grabbed it, is it also too much retconning to say that one of us identified it? Before we just, like, show up with it? It is too much? Okay. That's fine. Okay.
Kaladin Shash 02:35:19 that's why I'm not gonna say we have it yet. I wanna know what it does. And then we're still at, what occurred in the medical bay? What happened with the breach there? No, it was a good fight. We finished it. It is correct.
Dungeon Master 02:35:37 I'll go next if you're done. Nothing else you want to share? He's sort of still holding his pen. He puts down a final period and you see the text sort of riffles and on the page and sort of disappears and gets sent off to the system. He goes, OK, thanks for that. And then he sits back and he goes, yeah, so we were monitoring
Dungeon Master 02:36:03 The the rooftops and he pulls up the projection to to show like they're rough Rough positions at the certain points of the night. It's like we were here here and here and the fog had rolled in pretty heavy, but we had we had the aerial view so it wasn't too bad, but Man, I tell you it was like watching phantoms rise out of the darkness Like they just hopped out of every alley you could possibly imagine it was It was beyond perfectly coordinated. It was like they were of the same mind
Dungeon Master 02:36:31 once things started going down we were pretty distracted and we were in touch and you'd mentioned the medical bay and that i had to get there quick so i i used the best of my movement i only it only took me a few minutes to get there um but by the time i had gotten there there were a few guards dead nothing else disturbed but that that woman you know whatever her name is uh
Kaladin Shash 02:36:49 you.
Dungeon Master 02:36:59 She's just like she's a stone. She's a statue where she was they it's like as soon as they pulled off that mask she turned to stone At least I think I I Guess it she could be a fake or something again points to his like Automatic revolving crossbow pistols. He's like this is more of my game I
Zariel Torgan 02:37:10 I think her name was Roxanne.
Dungeon Master 02:37:26 They're working on it. I haven't gotten an updated report since it all just happened, but... I mean, if that ain't the most detailed statue I've ever seen, that looks more like a petrified person.
Kaladin Shash 02:37:40 uh, I look at Captain Levi and I, towards the end of our battle, I could smell, are you guys gonna see it? Towards the end of our battle, I could smell the same flowers that I could smell on the mask. We need, we need to pursue the individual and we know who it was.
Zariel Torgan 02:37:46 Do we, oh, sorry, go ahead.
Dungeon Master 02:38:03 Yeah, he sort of pulls up one of his scrolls, looks at it, sort of puts down his readers a little bit. Right, that's Cedric, that fighter you had encountered. We could try to work something up like that. You're asking some pretty high-level magic just to use on a whim. We'll see what we got.
Kaladin Shash 02:38:14 Yes, but we need some sort of ability to see invisibility, a potion, something to give us advantage.
Dungeon Master 02:38:37 Anything else, gentlemen? To the point. I love it. Well, not to the point. You guys talked a lot in between. As of this morning, Silvera's son Seeker has retired. He says it just wasn't quite a good fit for him. Verbatim. Seeing as such, there is a.
Zariel Torgan 02:38:41 Uh, yeah, can we get paid?
Kaladin Shash 02:38:44 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:39:07 A promotion available for you guys to advance the next level if you're interested.
Zariel Torgan 02:39:14 I have a proposition that I think is out of character for my character to make, but I'll say it as a player. He was a member of the Omen Knights. I think we could be a member of the O'Dyr Knights. OK.
Kaladin Shash 02:39:28 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:39:30 He's not giving us the opportunity to be open nights right now though. Oh, okay.
Dungeon Master 02:39:31 cute but the omen knights aren't like a specific group it's a it's like a section of the military force so you could still call yourself whatever you want but he's like offering you uh an advancement in the system yes he is saying you guys can get a promotion to be omen knights but it's not like you are taking sylvarius's
Zariel Torgan 02:39:47 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:39:59 adventuring group. His group wasn't called the Omenites. If you guys remember when we did the one shots, you were technically classified as Omenites. It's just like the next rank up. It's like the group that specializes in fighting like individuals once they've mutated and fighting just straight up monsters. It's like less of day to day city crimes and more of like you are a part of the task force kind of deal. You get the higher task missions.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:28 So which one of which one of us gets the cool name and which one of the rest of us has to all have the same name? Wasn't that? Yeah. But. Yeah, but his name had alliteration, and usually that means premeditation. But I digress.
Leopold Magnus 02:40:29 I see. Well, sorry.
Kaladin Shash 02:40:29 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:40:35 What? That was just his name. You know that, right? Look, that wasn't a title. His name is Sylvarius Sunseeker of the Sunseeker Estates. It makes sense that he doesn't work anymore. I think it's been thought ahead on that. Like, I guess you can rename yourself. I don't care, but you don't get to take his name. I think that's illegal.
Leopold Magnus 02:40:59 Yes, well, and there was the unfortunate consequence of his three compatriots, Taser, Taser, and Blazer. All of those folks were basically carbon copies of Mr. Sunseeker. So I think what Zario's getting at here is,
Kaladin Shash 02:40:59 All right.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:06 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, all of them were named Taser.
Dungeon Master 02:41:12 Yeah. They look very similar. He's a, he's a sort of a fashion icon in the, in the market district. That was unfortunate that they had their lives taken last night, but thanks for the jokes.
Leopold Magnus 02:41:30 I think what he's asking is which one of us has to look like each other and which one gets to be cool. Is that right, Zario? Well, I guess you're right. That, I guess, leaves me being Taser and you being Taser. Is that right?
Zariel Torgan 02:41:38 Well, I mean, it's a bit of a redundant. It doesn't really matter. I mean, look at Kaladin and then look at the two of us. I think we all know who's setting the fashion standard in this group. No, I'm going to be Blazer.
Kaladin Shash 02:41:47 Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:41:51 Alright, enough. He'll interrupt. He goes **** to hell. Lord Marshall will be in touch when he can.
Leopold Magnus 02:42:02 Oh. Oh, you want to be different, then. I see. OK.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:06 Well, I guess you and I should be the same.
Dungeon Master 02:42:17 He'll formally sort of give you your promotion and rank upgrade. With it will come another voucher for upgrading your armor if you see fit. Work out some new modifications on charge of the Corps. Beyond that, he looks up, he goes, Sergeant Farsight, I believe you have something for them. And then
Kaladin Shash 02:42:30 All right.
Dungeon Master 02:42:47 Racha goes right at Yeah, you guys uh, would you like to go to the lotto? Well, uh about that in fact This one there wasn't this wasn't a formal contract. So there wasn't a cash value associated with it
Zariel Torgan 02:42:56 Yeah, don't we get like a little cash and a token too? We're getting gypped.
Kaladin Shash 02:43:04 Lower.
Dungeon Master 02:43:16 But you got a promotion, free armor, and some additional equipment. I figure that pretty much weighs out. Plus, I heard you made some pretty hefty coin when you were at that tavern. Out of character, you're pissed.
Zariel Torgan 02:43:34 Uh, yeah. Well, in character, I'm, I'm appreciative. So that out of character, I'm outraged.
Kaladin Shash 02:43:41 Yes, let's go use this token.
Dungeon Master 02:43:47 I had a kick to it, I don't give a fuck. Anyway. Ratchet-like notion, like... We'll do it real quick, it's 11, so I wanna get you to end it real quick, but everybody, sorta as you're at the lotto machine, same deal works. Go ahead and roll me a D100, and let me see how many numbers we have at this point. We'll do...
Dungeon Master 02:44:17 A D100 and divided by 2. 45.
Zariel Torgan 02:44:23 Who wants to go first? Go for it. Which one's better?
Leopold Magnus 02:44:28 I'm ready. Round down. Round up. Give me the 23.
Kaladin Shash 02:44:34 Yeah, I got 22. 23. Yeah, I think that should be it. Oh, that's dirty.
Dungeon Master 02:44:46 Which one do you want? OK. We'll go over what it is next time, but who wants to roll next? Keep you on the hook.
Zariel Torgan 02:44:56 Big money. Get it, Caledon. Jesus.
Leopold Magnus 02:45:06 Jonathan has to come up with some things.
Dungeon Master 02:45:09 Now I've got them. I'm going to create them to actual items and everything, but I also want to just keep it for next time and 94 is like 47. OK. Got that, but your name next to it so I remember who gets what.
Kaladin Shash 02:45:18 47, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:45:28 73 said be 36.
Dungeon Master 02:45:36 73 and 2. Yeah. Perfect. OK. OK. Awesome. I will describe what they look like as you pull them out, and I'll tell you what they actually are. Leopold, you go first. You step up your big metal frame.
Dungeon Master 02:46:03 lumbering to the thing, you insert your coin, press it, the dials go, the magic shoots out, and out of the little dispenser and like a craft egg, you crack it open, and there is a doll, sitting such a tall porcelain face.
Leopold Magnus 02:46:20 Ooh, um, hmm, quite interesting. There was one for dollies, more for books, but I guess this will come in handy at some point. And I kind of set it on my shoulder.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:34 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:46:35 Great, Kaladin, you roll the machine, everything goes the same, except you, as the thing pops out, you crack the egg and you look inside and there is this potion.
Dungeon Master 02:46:54 that looks like inside of it, the floating material looks like wood, but it's liquid. It is flowing in the jar of the little, you know, cylinder that it's in. Looks like liquid wood is the best way to describe it. Zariel, you, go ahead. Nope.
Kaladin Shash 02:47:12 Would I have any understanding of what that is just by how it looks? Okay. That's fine.
Dungeon Master 02:47:24 Straight up, not even because I want to save it, you've never seen anything like this. Zorro, you do the same thing, roll the machine, lights go off, magic shoots out, crack the egg, and you get this tiny little red toolbox. About one inch by a half inch by a half inch, little like red tin. And that's what you see.
Zariel Torgan 02:47:39 Does it open? Awesome. I mean, not if it's like a big deal. I just, you know, if I got that as a person, I would just want to open the little lever.
Dungeon Master 02:47:54 Would you like to open it? I could stop it before it goes to a big deal. You open up the top of it, it works on metal hinges. It expands to be like,
Zariel Torgan 02:48:07 Yeah, I just want to see if it has a little latch that opens or if it's a solid, like a toy piece. Oh, shit.
Dungeon Master 02:48:22 a foot wide by like a foot like it becomes more like square rectangular and you see a ladder goes into the darkness at the top of the lid. Maybe. Anyway, that's where we're going to end our session. That's what you saw.
Kaladin Shash 02:48:34 Is it like a rope trick box That's rad
Zariel Torgan 02:48:40 I think okay. Nice. No, it goes down into it. Very good.
Leopold Magnus 02:48:43 Damn, wait, so a ladder just came out? Oh, a ladder goes into it. Crazy, okay. Yeah, absolutely.
Dungeon Master 02:48:56 A good sesh, guys. That was a lot of fun.

Zariel Torgan 00:00:00 you
Dungeon Master 00:00:00 Oh, recording. Wait, OK. Everybody figure out their level stuff before we get going.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:25 Oh yeah, I was I was in the process. I just almost done. Well, let's go. Why?
Zariel Torgan 00:00:31 Yeah, I was under the impression that I got cool stuff for five. I do not. I do not get anything. No, nothing. Yeah. It would be max.
Kaladin Shash 00:00:38 Is it a proficiency bonus? Is that all it was? Oh, it's just way to grind on. Let's try. Yep.
Dungeon Master 00:00:46 Yeah That probably means you're hitting 20 Oh you get one from um
Leopold Magnus 00:00:49 I'm trying to do an ability score improvement, but it won't let me do two intelligence scores. Am I capped out there? Which is weird, because I feel, I was looking at my character sheet, I'm like 18. Yeah. Oh, I see. That's weird. That says total 20, but that my intelligence is 18.
Dungeon Master 00:01:16 Like a racial bonus or something, probably. Like you get a bonus somewhere else. Yeah, you said you were waiting on that.
Leopold Magnus 00:01:19 Got it. Makes sense. You only get that little improvement every two stat points, right? It's like on an even.
Kaladin Shash 00:01:27 Yeah, I just need to roll a hit die. Yeah, I was going to roll it in the group. Yeah. Well, not great. I got a four. It was almost a 10.
Zariel Torgan 00:01:40 Yeah, same here. That's what I'm waiting on. Mm-hmm. Aw, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:01:49 Yeah. Nice.
Leopold Magnus 00:01:50 Where do we roll the dice again, sorry?
Kaladin Shash 00:02:11 Nice.
Zariel Torgan 00:02:13 Sweet. All right, go on and fix it.
Dungeon Master 00:02:21 It would be, I think you're a D8, and then you just add it to your hit dice total, unless you have your character set to just taking the average with each. I don't know what you ended up doing. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:02:33 I think I changed it. Where is that? Hit point type is manual. Oh, the 1D648.
Kaladin Shash 00:02:43 50.
Dungeon Master 00:02:48 Sweet, yeah, so you'd be rolling for it. Hopefully you've been rolling for it. You should have five. Aren't you also a level in Wizard 2? Wizards are d6s. Perfect, yeah. So have you been rolling it? What's your... Versus 50 and 51 though.
Zariel Torgan 00:03:07 Well, we already got our new stuff. He's still four.
Leopold Magnus 00:03:09 I think so. I'm at 37 hit points. I feel like that's about right for level 4. Oh, is it? Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:03:20 Well, rates, but I need to add some. I'll be 54. I'm just trying to get the dice roll right. Because my Constitution's already been added. That's why it went up to 50. Yeah. There we go. Now I got it right.
Dungeon Master 00:03:33 Yeah, just the con manually. Yeah, I guess if you did it for this level and you got a decent role, you'd be just under them. So artifice or wizard would make sense for that. It's your con modifier. You get a plus whatever your con is to every level.
Leopold Magnus 00:03:46 Yeah. It says I've rolled 22 hit points. I don't know where the rest of them come from. Oh, OK. Yeah, so for four levels, I managed 22. OK, 4d8, 1d6, let me.
Zariel Torgan 00:04:00 on.
Dungeon Master 00:04:03 Pretty good.
Leopold Magnus 00:04:29 That's pretty fat. It's 30. Oh, oh, I see. So I just rolled one. Every level you roll that one. No, I see.
Dungeon Master 00:04:34 That is. But you've already rolled all but one of those dice already, in theory. Like, if you just took a level on Artificer, you'd be rolling 1d8. Does that make sense? Yeah, you roll a hit dice of the class you're taking.
Zariel Torgan 00:04:35 You know that would be an interesting like trade-off like every level you read
Leopold Magnus 00:05:00 God, that's not bad. OK, now I need to go in and edit that 7. It's not bad, too.
Dungeon Master 00:05:03 Reroll your health. Seven's good though. No, seven is good. No.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:06 Yeah, because then, like, you could hypothetically, like, go down in hit points, even if you gained a level, just because of the rolls. That's interesting. Can you guys... Oh, seven's great. Can you guys hear me chewing?
Kaladin Shash 00:05:29 No. No.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:34 OK, alright, it just with the headphones on it sounds like really loud. I got these little like crunchy cookies that I'm snacking on and I just I'm worried it's just like. It just feels loud.
Dungeon Master 00:05:44 I always worry about that too, which is why I usually have my Discord up and I wait to see if I can see like a green line around my chat.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:53 Yeah, yeah. I was checking that earlier, but it just, I think it's because of the, you know, the science word I can't think of where you hear yourself with vibrations in your skull louder than, you know, you hear normal sounds. I think it's like bone conduction, I think, or something.
Kaladin Shash 00:06:06 Yes.
Leopold Magnus 00:06:11 I always use push to talk, so. Yeah, that sounds about right. Yeah, microphone only active, pushing a button, which is a sort of old holdover from playing video games and stuff. Like these days, actually, Discord does a really nice job of like voice isolation and cutting out all the backgrounds and stuff,
Dungeon Master 00:06:19 You have to press a button, yeah. Oh, it's so good.
Zariel Torgan 00:06:21 How does push to talk work? Do you just mute yourself every time or? Oh. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:06:41 That's wild.
Kaladin Shash 00:06:41 It really does. Yeah, I got I got my I got my level set. I didn't have to really pick anything. I just had to roll the dice. I think my character sheet updated. Oh, it didn't yet. Let me do it again. Should say 54 now.
Dungeon Master 00:06:52 Everybody in the Spotify, everybody finish up their characters. Don't look in your inventory yet, because we'll resume it right at the start of it with you guys looking at what you've got. But I did go ahead and make item
Kaladin Shash 00:07:11 Okay. Daryl, did you roll a maximum on your hit dice? That's awesome, that's awesome. That's good, I like that you're 51 now, get beefy. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:07:20 in the D&D Beyond for everything you got. So we will cover that, but I don't want you guys to spoil it yet. Me and Brad were talking about that. You're just always the one who runs it. It's just always you.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:31 Yeah, I got an eight. Yeah, I would. I need to. I went down so many times. Yeah, it's true. I might be a little one note.
Kaladin Shash 00:07:43 Yeah. The bear just just charges in as a bear every time. That's. It's OK, we need that right now. Well, so it's.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:00 Yeah, I was thinking about that, you know, my, my spell economy really suffers when I do that. But then I think also, we don't have a tank. You know, we don't have any sort of Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I did the math. I think I took like 139 points of damage that last fight.
Dungeon Master 00:08:00 This is the fighter. You're absorbing a fuck ton of damage.
Kaladin Shash 00:08:13 You guys gonna say I feel like I feel like I feel like you easily absorbed like 60% of the hit points in that that battle. I think I only took like I only took like 30. Yeah, I only took like 30 somethings. Cuz I had all the mirror images out, right? Like I dodged like 2 1‚ÅÑ2 rounds of fighting. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:08:13 Yeah. Holy crap. No, I took no damage.
Dungeon Master 00:08:29 I mean, he did a lot of radiant damage. Yeah, you did. You did dodge a lot. You're so hard to hit that I just need to start subjecting you to dexterity saves or something.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:39 Oh. That was fantastic, yeah. That always does great. That was the opposite problem I had with Maharb. He would always be in the blast radius of stuff, so he'd never take any damage. Pissed me off, yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.
Kaladin Shash 00:08:47 Jump out of the way.
Leopold Magnus 00:08:55 Yeah, the monk was really good for that. You're like, oh, is that a dex save? Okay, yeah, no damage.
Dungeon Master 00:09:16 Okay, Craig, get ready. Our last session picked up in sort of an odd place as we had been working through this cultist attack on the domed city through the Don district. The Odears had stumbled into an ancient chapel devoted to some long forgotten god.
Dungeon Master 00:09:44 and there seemed to be an air of deceptive aura encapsulating the entirety of this temple in the cavern. You found High Cleric Father Kalor there, or rather you found him to have been a very powerful celestial-type monster blind with devotion to their cause. In this intense fight with multiple stages, you guys had simultaneous updates with the events going around with the Med Bay and on the streets as you fought the Reverend, the true creature's name.
Kaladin Shash 00:09:58 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:10:14 You almost went down. It was looking a little grim, especially in terms of full death with Zariel, but you guys really hung on through some good thinking, great rolls, good attack damage. You guys finally took down the Reverend and in an amazing natural 20 moment for perception, you guys sort of got some not real insight into the presence you'd been feeling, but you made
Dungeon Master 00:10:43 um like um you had a discovery you found this evidence that was like there's a physical presence to some extent watching you as you had seen footprints in the residue of the fairy fire spell that had been cast quickly disappearing after knowing it had been discovered um the presence also disappeared slightly before then however
Dungeon Master 00:11:08 Kaladin had gotten a faint whiff of flowers again and later discovered that Cedric had been on the run with the mask, the mysterious woman having turned to stone, no sign of life. You guys slept on it over the night after being exhausted and then
Dungeon Master 00:11:29 When you awoke, you went and got your lotto tokens. And in sort of the walk to that break room, you had been discussing that Leopold sees a lot of people eat spiders in their sleep. Just watches it constantly. And that there's a surprisingly high number of spiders in the core. Just established. Everywhere.
Kaladin Shash 00:11:47 I forgot about that. Everywhere.
Leopold Magnus 00:11:56 They're crawling around.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:57 He has you everywhere.
Dungeon Master 00:12:04 Um, you talked with, uh, ratchet and you talked with captain Levi and you were requested to the med bay and all this stuff has happened, but we want to pick up with you guys. I want to give you a chance to look at what I gave you. I'm assuming you guys would all just take a chance, take the time to, um, Attune after you got them, you just kind of hang out for a little bit.
Kaladin Shash 00:12:31 And then is this. Are these the items that we just received through the lottery thing. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:32 Absolutely.
Dungeon Master 00:12:42 Yeah, you... Hold on, I have it written somewhere. I don't remember. Off the top of my... Oh, you had the potion that had sort of what looked like bark and wood and dirt swirling around in like green magic. Zariel got a small red toolbox. And Leopold had gotten... What did he get? It's the one that I'm not remembering.
Dungeon Master 00:13:16 Oh, a doll. You got a haunted doll that resembles you slightly. And then you had also stashed the sword that you had found. It's on your back.
Leopold Magnus 00:13:19 That's right. Yeah, I put it on my shoulder. It's kind of hanging out.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:35 nice. I'll go first if everybody else is still doing their thing. Mine is the pocket workshop.
Dungeon Master 00:13:43 If you guys want to share, go for it. I want to give you the chance.
Kaladin Shash 00:13:46 Thank you. Yeah, I'm just trying to read and. Taking part.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:00 It is a battered red toolbox, roughly one foot by six inch by six inch in dimension. And so basically, as an action, you can either place or pick up the toolbox. And when opened, a ladder appears going down into the toolbox. And a medium or smaller creature can magically fit into the opening without squeezing. And then inside of it, there is an extra dimensional space
Zariel Torgan 00:14:29 of about 30 square feet. And it's stocked with carpenter's tools, mason's tools, potter's tools, tinkering tools, and woodworking tools. And it also contains materials to work with no more than 100 gold pieces. Let's see. And provides snacks for up to eight people. And then every day at midnight, it refreshes all of that stuff inside. That's pretty sweet.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:54 Oh, that's cool. That's fine. I've got all the tools. So mine is a six inch porcelain doll, and if it is on my person on my third death saving throw,
Kaladin Shash 00:14:55 vision. That's right, man.
Dungeon Master 00:14:59 I thought that when I read that, I was like, that's perfect for Leo. And then Zario got it. And Zario's not very smart.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:05 Yeah, I was thinking that was perfect. Holy shit.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:24 The doll will take your place. Crumbling to ash. Yeah, so basically it's a get out of jail free card. Although I guess I'd have to roll another death save. The fourth death.
Kaladin Shash 00:15:37 Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:42 I was gonna say, does it... Interesting. So does it just takes that third death save, so you're still sitting at two death saves? Failed? Okay. It still buys you another round. Yeah, that's pretty good.
Dungeon Master 00:15:42 If you're not. Yeah, not all of the items are as good as.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:54 That would be my impression, yeah. Yeah, it says if by chance you take a third death saving throw after that, you still die. Yeah, so one eye stroke.
Kaladin Shash 00:16:07 Yeah. I acquired a potion. And it's called the soul wood prosthesis.
Dungeon Master 00:16:12 the pocket workshop. That was really a good poll.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:19 I'm pretty happy with it.
Kaladin Shash 00:16:34 And I think, I guess that's why it kind of looks like swirling wood pattern. It says the potion's rumored to be concocted from the dark bark root and vegetation from the sacred tree of life. Swirl slowly. To gain the benefit of the potion, you must be attuned to it. And when used, the potion is consumed and the attunement fades. It says after you've lost a limb, you can drink this potion. The contents begin to shape itself into the missing limb, which can then be controlled through the lost
Kaladin Shash 00:17:04 And then you can control the limb through that new thing. The prosthesis has the potential to grow and become more powerful if practiced and trained with. It's excellent. It doesn't say like, is it just with me until I lose another limb?
Zariel Torgan 00:17:16 Are you going to chop off your arm and drink that? You're going to have like one beefy robot arm.
Dungeon Master 00:17:29 You don't know. That's pretty high level magic.
Kaladin Shash 00:17:37 OK. And then just above the table, if if one of us was was to have lost a limb in game. Would we not assume that core medics and medicine or healing would be able to regrow it or reattach it like next day, whatever? Yeah. Right, alright, OK, could you know?
Dungeon Master 00:17:57 So it's not something that like it does exist, but it's sort of for the elite.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:06 Yeah I think, well I guess it depends on how you play it, Jonathan. But normally if you want to take somebody's limb, you have to make it like a called attack, so the AC goes up, so I guess technically a monster could do that to one of us, but that's why losing limbs is pretty rare. Mechanically.
Leopold Magnus 00:18:26 So you just normally die. Or just stick your arm out in front of the attack to see if you can block it. Maybe you'll lose an arm.
Dungeon Master 00:18:26 You guys want to focus strikes. I've got mechanics on it. Yes. So you wouldn't have to be attuned to it all the time. You just have to attune to it after losing a limb.
Kaladin Shash 00:18:30 Yeah. So. So simply being in tune to the potion means I can use it. Right? And using it is what grows the limb. Before big battle or. Oh, any point? OK, I got it. It's even better.
Dungeon Master 00:18:57 And then regrow your limit at that point.
Kaladin Shash 00:19:02 That's sweet, okay. It says limb, just one limb, just a limb. After you've lost just a limb, it's a good check. I want new legs that just grow. That's awesome.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:02 Does it say just one limb? Okay. It's pretty sweet.
Dungeon Master 00:19:36 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:36 Well, I guess mechanically speaking, the pocket workshop, we probably wouldn't want to sleep in there because somebody could just steal it, right? Because it doesn't disappear when we go inside of it, right? Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:19:58 Uh, I don't know. Oh, do you guys that also in my inventory? I totally stopped right when I saw a new is my. That's hilarious, let me let me look deeper into this.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:58 Yeah, somebody just closed the lid and take you away.
Zariel Torgan 00:20:06 I mean, I guess it.
Dungeon Master 00:20:07 Then Bryn, would you also share about the sword? Where did you keep that to yourself? And it's also in your inventory.
Dungeon Master 00:20:42 Anyway, so as you guys are moving, I think what you guys had been discussing, just to kind of put you back in the same mindset, was do you go look for Cedric right away, or do you wait? Yes.
Leopold Magnus 00:21:01 Hmm.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:02 Hmm. Is it in your backpack? Oh, that's cool.
Kaladin Shash 00:21:04 Wait for what I thought we, I thought we long rested. I Jonathan, I'll be honest. I don't think I don't see any new item in my. I'm looking at everything right now, not just backpack or equipment or inventory.
Dungeon Master 00:21:21 Come on. It's um. I see I have the it's like rarity is variable. Instead of like something special, so it's just a white item in your inventory, but it's called light splitter.
Kaladin Shash 00:21:50 Oh, there it is. Hello. No, yeah, Jonathan, of course, but yeah, that was perfect. Yeah, there you go.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:55 That's weird, because it says Kaladin just shared it. Oh, did you roll that d20 for me? OK, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:21:59 I shared it from his thing. Yeah, earlier, when I connected to your guys' character sheets, because I loaded up, I didn't realize that my pixel dice had just connected to each of your character sheets. So I picked it up and moved it to the corner of my dice tray. And it rolled, because I always keep 20 up, obviously.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:26 That's pretty cool.
Kaladin Shash 00:22:27 So it's a long sword. You guys can see that. That's pretty great.
Dungeon Master 00:22:54 Okay, but um So we'll just start it back up with you guys We're in this sort of pause this like beat You said you kept it on your back Yeah, we did retcon we did retcon that you guys
Kaladin Shash 00:23:02 Um, I, did I not, did I not, did, did I, didn't I tell him I had it? Did I not give it to them? Leadership or we're just telling me, do we keep that to ourselves? Okay. But we said we found it where we denied that as well.
Dungeon Master 00:23:23 had taken it because initially I didn't realize that you thought I like said it went innate and went like just normal. But then you guys are like, okay, we would have picked it up if it was a weapon. And then at the meeting, you said that you kept it tucked on your back, you didn't have it in open display.
Kaladin Shash 00:23:43 All right.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:55 Oh, I think my proficiency bonus went up. Maybe that's something that did happen. Okay, cool. So we're headed out, right? We're headed after him, right? Like we took a long rest, we got our shit, and we're going, right? Sweet.
Kaladin Shash 00:24:10 I think that's what we talked about, and I'm totally on board with that. Try to track something down, try to get a lead on Cedric. Oh, let's try with those dreams as well. Just read my own notes right now. Yeah, yeah, crazy. Good ones.
Leopold Magnus 00:24:19 Yep, that was my opinion.
Dungeon Master 00:24:32 You did have your, um, your dreams as well. Totally forgot that. Um, it was, this is Zario. No, yes. Zario and Adrian, Liam did not this time. Sorry, fellas, where you heading?
Kaladin Shash 00:24:46 Me. Yeah, yeah. I mean, the only known location we know for Cedric is the spit and swallow or sip and swass, sip and spit. What was it called?
Zariel Torgan 00:24:47 I'll add in.
Leopold Magnus 00:25:12 Spit and swallow, I think. Don't we know where he ran from? I mean, can we go back to where he stole the girl and then grab him?
Kaladin Shash 00:25:14 So. We also. Right, we were gonna have to go through the tunnels is what I was.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:17 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:25:18 The last place you eventually figured out that you had smelled him was from the Chapel of Teo. That was the one that was underground. You had gotten a whiff there and that was the last sort of identified location.
Kaladin Shash 00:25:44 expecting to have to do. Right? Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:47 Yeah, that makes sense. Did we decide we wanted to go from the med bay on or to just go right back to where we smelled him and then go from there?
Leopold Magnus 00:25:48 Yeah, that was that was my thought was just kind of track his last known location and see if we can follow him.
Dungeon Master 00:26:02 All right, so where are you going?
Kaladin Shash 00:26:17 Well, I don't think there's any point in going to Med Bay. She's petrified, right? Unless we get more information from like Captain Levi or something. Is that what you're saying? Well, I guess we could check in with at least our superior. We could tell, well, I guess Ratchet's injured. So who do we, the Omen Knights report to who now? Captain Levi?
Zariel Torgan 00:26:26 Yeah, yeah, unless there's something that they haven't already told us about it that would be helpful. Otherwise, yeah, we should probably just head right back to that little underground place we were at first.
Dungeon Master 00:26:48 You don't know you haven't like really gotten that um Like really thorough like debrief of what it meant to get that promotion it was like You haven't waited for that yet because it was supposed to be like bestowed upon you by the Lord Marshal himself, so That hasn't happened yet
Dungeon Master 00:27:15 Because then you guys were like, let's go figure out where Cedric is. Okay, so where do you want to start from?
Kaladin Shash 00:27:15 OK, so we we know it's in the works. Yeah. That's perfect, OK? Let's let's just go. Let me check in with everybody. We're just doing our jobs. I mean, do we have the option of literally? Like fast traveling right back to
Zariel Torgan 00:27:36 Sweet. Yeah, let's do it.
Kaladin Shash 00:27:46 The giant chapel, the cavernous chapel. Okay. Is this session 10? Oh my gosh, I don't know. Oh, I don't think I counted that.
Dungeon Master 00:27:49 No, we could say you run there quickly. This is 11.
Leopold Magnus 00:28:09 I might be 11, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:28:18 a little three hour, one or two now.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:28 So based on our basic, okay, go ahead. I was just going to say, based on our basic impression of the layout of these tunnels and where we are proximity to the medical area, are we pretty sure it's one versus the other of these tunnels?
Dungeon Master 00:28:28 Yeah. You eventually get there. Go ahead. I don't know. It's like you're 30. Yeah, I'll do you one more.
Kaladin Shash 00:28:52 One. When we were told leads back. OK. Sweet. I would I would remind everyone that's where I smelled it.
Dungeon Master 00:28:57 you had sort of got the width from like this direction down at the bottom right there.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:14 Right, well, I guess we should get going then, right? Do we want to look for anything here? No.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:24 Well, I don't know. I think I've seen enough. Best get going. No.
Kaladin Shash 00:29:29 Uhm? Neither of you are proficient in long swords, right? OK. That's fine. I was just making sure I wasn't being greedy with the weapon. Is that OK? Right? Yeah, I didn't attune to this one either yet. I'm still using my spear right now.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:46 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:29:48 You do also know that a Hamhawk can modify weapons. Okay, you guys head through this tunnel. Somebody go ahead and give me like the leader of the pack. We'll just do a survival check.
Kaladin Shash 00:30:04 Yes. I would absolutely support you doing that.
Zariel Torgan 00:30:18 My survival's pretty good. Yeah, does somebody want to aid me? Oh, you just said whoever's in front. Yeah, I'll go first. I got a plus seven, so I'll just roll it. Can I have some aid? No, I meant Jonathan. I didn't know if you wanted a single or if you were going to let... Okay. That's better.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:32 All in. Yeah, all in. Always.
Kaladin Shash 00:30:33 Oh, that's great.
Dungeon Master 00:30:42 Yeah. Yeah. Do what you're going to do.
Zariel Torgan 00:30:51 I'll be walking along and I'll say, get really hung up on this cool little plant thing. And Leo will have to nudge me back looking for the guy we're looking for. Oh, thank you, thank you. 22. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't analyze it too much.
Leopold Magnus 00:31:06 Zaria, I think you might be on this way.
Dungeon Master 00:31:11 Did you just go, um, did you just go Elvis for a second? I think I, um, yeah, 22, uh, like, uh, we're going to do success and failure. So three successes, you catch up to them, yada, yada, yada. Um, but we'll say, uh, it's been a while, obviously you slept overnight. You figure that he must've gotten at least a little hurt. So he might've,
Kaladin Shash 00:31:15 Different kind of country. Yeah, that's great.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:24 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:31:40 rested so you're just kind of moving at a hurried pace but maybe not like outright sprinting because you did say walking but you're making your way through um and you feel like you're going the right directions especially as zariel's like sniffing and and analyzing as you guys are like jog walking um and then eventually you know you're on the right path uh because you get a faint whiff of wildflowers down one of the tunnels that zariel leads you into
Dungeon Master 00:32:10 It disappears. It's almost like wafting and waiting for you. But go ahead, and we'll do another check. If you're still leading, that seems to be working. What if we're another success?
Zariel Torgan 00:32:23 Uh, yeah, does somebody else want to give me some aid? All right, sweet. 24.
Kaladin Shash 00:32:28 They can certainly assist you this time.
Dungeon Master 00:32:40 running and running and running. And then as you're moving, you have this sort of realization of like, we've been sort of moving downhill this entire time, like this manually carved tunnel that's been going on for who knows how long, just like keeps going and going. And eventually you find that the hand-carved tunnel gives way to like natural pathing, like there's a cave system deep below the city.
Dungeon Master 00:33:09 And then eventually you guys end up on a map I can put you.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:27 Nice. I guess we'll just keep cooking, right? All right. Natural 20 for a 27.
Kaladin Shash 00:33:36 Oops. Yeah, boy.
Leopold Magnus 00:33:46 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:33:47 easy you uh into this open room natural 20 you like hear something to your left and you find that there's a path down this way that leads backwards this way and with a natural 20 i'll give you the chance go ahead and give me a um i want to say just intelligence check i know maybe not your strong suit
Zariel Torgan 00:34:16 Does it have to be me? All right, here we go. 11.
Dungeon Master 00:34:20 Yeah. 11. It's pretty good. I mean, it's fine. You know this is the right way. You just don't get anything extra with that, because it was a pretty obscure grab. But you guys move through, and you know that that is the way that you want to go. So I assume you guys are just running, moving that way, not wasting any time.
Kaladin Shash 00:34:28 But in our version.
Zariel Torgan 00:34:49 Yeah, we're kicking butt.
Dungeon Master 00:34:57 Beautiful. You guys, that tunnel gives way to a huge tunnel. And as you guys emerge into this space. Oh, I'm about to. Doesn't do anything, it's already revealed. At the bottom will towards the bottom.
Dungeon Master 00:35:18 you see two figures running, one of which just looks like a standard. I don't think there's a picture art for it, but just like one of the cultists wearing the simple robes running behind and to that person's front and right sprinting ahead of them. You can tell from the back that it's like Cedric, but there seems something wrong from this distance. You can't really tell. But obviously, if you look at the thing, it's going to tell you what it looks like. But from a far away,
Dungeon Master 00:35:45 You're not noticing a whole lot other than like his form is a little misshapen and seems warped from what you had seen last. They don't seem to have noticed you.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:56 Are we just going? Are we just doing this? Yeah, we're not. Oh. Are they running, or are they just trudging?
Leopold Magnus 00:36:08 Full steam ahead. Oh, OK.
Dungeon Master 00:36:15 Yeah, they're like, it's like you had with your three successes, and one of them being a natural 20. They had been like working through this cave system. You don't know why. Right? That's not the goal. But they didn't like maybe take the correct path each time. And
Dungeon Master 00:36:33 We simplified it because I didn't make, you know, 40 maps of it. But you took all the right paths, long tunnels, you've been walking for a while, but you were always going the right direction. So at this point, you've sort of, it's a large space. But I want it to be like too far as far as like map.
Dungeon Master 00:36:49 capability and how fun it would be but like think of it as like a pretty big space and you guys are descending these huge stairs that like drop into this enormous cavern and like way at the bottom still moving forward down these multiple switchbacks you see cedric and this cultist and that's sort of the scene
Zariel Torgan 00:36:53 Hmm?
Dungeon Master 00:37:12 You hear distant water in the past running through these tunnels and systems and underwater reserves, and you hear bats every now and again. But you've moved down so far that it's entirely possible that you've left the domed area or are still underneath but are in a different biome entirely.
Dungeon Master 00:37:36 And you've happened to catch up to them. So I don't know what you guys are going to attack them or if you want to watch them and follow behind. That's really up to you. But also, if you're not 20, I was like, OK, you guys can show up behind them not noticed.
Kaladin Shash 00:37:53 OK. Let can we. The goal is to get the mask back. I mean, is it would it be bad just to observe them for at least a second before we decide if we want to rush up like are they clearly trying to head a certain direction? Do we feel like we're going the only way they're going?
Zariel Torgan 00:37:53 What do you guys think? Do you wanna sneak up on him and attack? Do you wanna... I mean, I feel like we just need to get that mask back, right? Um...
Leopold Magnus 00:38:20 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:38:23 Yeah, what about what about I mean, we're if we're like, if the map isn't perfectly accurate, and we're pretty far away, maybe we'll just like, stealth run or something, try to be quite quieter than we were, but try to make up some ground and get maybe a bit closer. That way, if we are noticed, we're not like multiple rounds away.
Dungeon Master 00:38:28 Mm-hmm. No, they're farther than that.
Kaladin Shash 00:38:46 Is the ruler accurate right now, Jonathan? Are they 60 feet away? 50, 55, 60? OK, OK. Oh, that's all right. I think it's huge.
Dungeon Master 00:38:55 You had just told me that managing the last battle map was a little tough at how big it was, so I made this one smaller in the case that you wanted to fight them. Nah, this works. We have a cinematic version and an initiative version, you know?
Zariel Torgan 00:38:56 Yeah, well.
Kaladin Shash 00:39:15 OK, yeah, so this is this is a tight window. We're only. We're only one round away from them. We're pretty close. Yeah, let's just let's.
Dungeon Master 00:39:29 As you can see, they seem to be discussing something. Their pace is slowed to like a slow walk, and they don't really have a good sense of direction of where they're at. Right now you see they're like looking around and waiting and pausing and discussing and moving forward a bit. But you guys have it closer if you need to. As you guys get, we'll say if you want to get closer than 40 feet,
Kaladin Shash 00:39:47 And I don't. Might be really nice to hear what they're saying.
Dungeon Master 00:39:56 Where you could be like hearing their entire conversation because they're not talking loud if you got that close i would need either a group stealth check or if one person does it one stealth check.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:09 What do you guys think? My stealth is plus two. All right, I'm gonna touch,
Leopold Magnus 00:40:16 Yeah. I'm not great. Yeah, I have disadvantage with a plus two, so maybe you should try to sneak up there, not me.
Kaladin Shash 00:40:21 I'm pretty good at stealth. I'm on plus 7. I just need to roll off. I'll sneak up. Yeah. Go on. Go on.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:37 talent and shoulder and say, you got this, go on, and it's going to give them guidance.
Dungeon Master 00:40:48 Mm-hmm.
Kaladin Shash 00:40:50 Yeah, I'm going to just slink right over the wall. And how close do I need to get there? 56 feet away? You said within 40? Jonathan, I'm going to try to use my movement to sneak more like over here, like in the shadows, try to be a little more obscured. That's 30 feet right there.
Kaladin Shash 00:41:20 That gets me within 36 feet of them. You said within 40? I'd kind of be behind that wall a little bit.
Dungeon Master 00:41:24 Perfect. Yeah, so as you sort of walk ahead of your friend group, and again, I want this like the map only does it so much justice. This is a pretty huge space, and there's like large mineral deposits underneath like dripping water that have created huge stalagmites at the bottom. And you can like duck between some of them
Dungeon Master 00:41:51 go beneath like a lumpy mineral rock log equivalent, just like this shape there. And you sort of come around a corner, and you finally start hearing what they're saying. Go ahead and give me a perception check and a stealth check as you approach. You can use the guidance on one or the other. Nice.
Kaladin Shash 00:42:09 All right, here's the stealth. And that's a nat 20 on the perception. And I didn't use guidance. Do I need to use it on a stealth or am I good at 22?
Dungeon Master 00:42:22 Natural quantity. I'll roll just for the hell of it. He has a roll it from your character sheet. Just so I don't reveal what I've got going on.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:22 Oh, damn. We just watch him just vanish. He's just one big ear.
Leopold Magnus 00:42:23 Oh, beautiful. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:42:55 I'll just roll it normal. Wasting time. He got 8 plus 7, so he only got a 15. Absolutely not.
Kaladin Shash 00:43:17 All right, good.
Dungeon Master 00:43:22 So you get a close and you hear this conversation and as you get closer it truly is. It sounds like Cedric is a little frustrated and you come around the corner and his form is like truly a little more monstrous at this point. He's standing at like what you approximate to be something like seven feet tall. His form is huge and broad. He has
Dungeon Master 00:43:52 like areas of his flesh instead of being normal flesh are like muscle fiber ropey sort of like strong peck look if you know what I'm saying but I'm just like green vines densely woven into that spot he's got like one on his arm and stuff and he sort of
Kaladin Shash 00:44:05 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:44:12 You can just feel it being a little bit more magically inclined. He's got this strong aura and this presence sort of just radiating off of him at all times. And his eyes sort of just emit dark smoke at times when his temper flares up. Over his face is the mask. He seems to be wearing it right now. And then you hear that he's saying,
Dungeon Master 00:44:39 As like he's looking around and he goes, I don't understand. It has to be around here somewhere. And then the guy next to him says, uh, boss, I don't like you just say and find the water that you can jump in. What does that mean? And he goes, I don't know what it means. He speaks in reels, but he's promising power once we get out.
Dungeon Master 00:45:01 And they seem to be walking forward and you're following behind them. So like they move forward, we'll say you get to here when they get down to here. And this is sort of like a long path. So you guys are gradually moving forward in real time. But eventually they hit sort of this cliff side. And there is a sound of water, but it feels very distant. And they hit the edge and you guys realize that overall maybe you've been walking for a few hours.
Dungeon Master 00:45:29 But you see, he finally gets so frustrated and goes. OK, we'll make camp for the night and search again in the morning. Maybe he'll speak to me and I can give a better direction. And they start to set up camp sort of on this cliffside at the bottom of this cavern.
Dungeon Master 00:45:46 Um, but they don't, they seem to just like be going, um, about their ways, not really looking out. Eventually they sort of look behind them, but with your stealth check, you're pretty hidden unless you're doing something drastic. So you can rejoin, stay out. What do you want to sort of do in this moment?
Kaladin Shash 00:46:03 Um, I'm just going to roll back. It's like 25 feet or so just I'm right up here now and I'm just going to go on the comms and just be like communicate. The change that I've seen in Cedric like.
Kaladin Shash 00:46:28 um this is the right path he's out in front they're getting ready to set up camp cedric is famous though now he's a emperor of monstrosity i think the stress points have changed him my goodness
Dungeon Master 00:46:51 What a terrific one.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:51 I wonder what his hit points are now.
Leopold Magnus 00:46:55 Well, um, Paladin, what are these stress points you speak of? Get out of my swamp, donkey.
Kaladin Shash 00:47:04 You've felt, what am I doing? You've felt. That's pretty good, that's exactly what I was going to. You've felt this before. You know what I mean, these surges of energy or life force that you have.
Leopold Magnus 00:47:31 Hmm. Yes, indeed. I have noticed that. Seems to be an initialized defense mechanism. I'm not quite sure what to make of it for me.
Dungeon Master 00:47:34 point.
Kaladin Shash 00:47:42 Um, I keep whispering. You need to sneak down here. We can all take advantage of starting with basketball together. Oh, really mug them. Really mug them. You are dirty.
Zariel Torgan 00:47:58 Do we want to perhaps wait till they sleep and then go in and pounce? Yeah. I mean, you know, if they're in a sleeping bag, you know, if they're like in a little sleeping bag, we could like clamp the top of the sleeping bag, then pick it up and hit them with like brooms.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:11 Mm hmm.
Kaladin Shash 00:48:14 So, yes, just brutal. This is how you take care of the rats in the core.
Zariel Torgan 00:48:30 Yeah, it's not a very elegant solution, but a solution nonetheless. I usually eat my spiders.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:37 Well, maybe I shall suggest we smush them like spiders instead. Would you prefer that? Well, I can't confirm.
Kaladin Shash 00:48:45 Clearly. I like the idea of waiting for them to sleep, but we still have to sneak up on them. Let's do that.
Dungeon Master 00:48:55 it.
Zariel Torgan 00:48:57 All right, well, I can do pass without a trace if we get close enough to Kaladin. So Jonathan, do I get the feeling that we could successfully sneak down to him? Or should, I don't know. Well, I'll sneak down to him.
Kaladin Shash 00:49:20 I can stealth back. I can keep stealthing back if I need to. Is that what you're worried about? I'll come back. I'll. I'll come back here. It's a walking suit of armor. Welcome back. Do you want me to? Do you want me to just get within 30 feet? Is that what that is? Or what is that?
Dungeon Master 00:49:24 You tell me, man, do you guys I mean, this is do you think you'd be sneaky enough to get down there is not going to tell you yes or no.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:37 yeah all right yeah so i'll probably cast yeah yeah just sneak back till you're 30 feet i gotta i gotta run up front i think my cousin's dad's here i gotta give him keys real quick but i'll be like i'll be like five minutes all right i'll be right back
Kaladin Shash 00:49:58 You're good. OK, you're good. Um? Jonathan, can I? Can I have attuned to light splitter? OK, great. Can you?
Dungeon Master 00:50:08 Yeah. Yes, you may have.
Kaladin Shash 00:50:24 Better explain the two charges are arcing slash. Does that give me like a throw range or like the sword like magically will just. Get long enough for an attack within 30 feet. You're in a radiant. We are. Let's.
Dungeon Master 00:50:37 no like you they're both like slashes so it's like you swing your sword in the direction of an enemy um and like a visible shot of like radiant energy shoots out that way so and it goes up to 30 feet before it dissipates or you can do it to do the other thing with void slash
Kaladin Shash 00:50:56 That's right. Does that hit? Question does that only hit one enemy or does that radiant or just keep moving? OK. It's cool, it's cool.
Dungeon Master 00:51:05 Just one enemy like just so you get a distant arranged attack with your sword. Now with. Your spear. It is. I think the others might have proficiency with spear. I think it's a simple weapon.
Dungeon Master 00:51:33 If you wanted to give it up, but I'm not going to force that, obviously. I think so. But obviously that was your first weapon, so you can keep your weapons.
Kaladin Shash 00:51:33 It's it's it's. No, it's technically a quarter staff. I think they'd all have. Proficiency with it, right? Because that's what it starts as if you want it, and then it elongates to the spear. Yeah. Yeah, we'll see. I mean, there's. Leopold, what do you use?
Kaladin Shash 00:52:01 As a primary weapon other than that little crossbow we've got. Oh, that's great. Yeah, you should have this. You should totally have this sphere right now. Uhm? You can use it single handed or double handed.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:05 That's pretty much it, the crossbow, and then my spells. And then otherwise, I just have the Steel Defender. What does it do?
Kaladin Shash 00:52:33 And it's a 1d6 plus 6, or sorry, 1d8. No, yeah, 1d6 plus 6 bludgeoning damage, because one half the spear is like a fist. The other half is a sharp point, or like piercing damage. And then it also has the option, because it's upgraded from the fungal guardian stuff that we got out of the thing that HamHawk put in it.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:47 Oh. That's right, yeah, I remember that.
Kaladin Shash 00:52:59 You can also you can also cast sleep essentially. Three times at one individual, which could be cool, because you're a bit of a. Kind of a caster and tinkerer. I mean, I mean, otherwise you're just using your crossbow. This will at least let you have a better chance at up close stuff, right?
Zariel Torgan 00:53:13 All right, I am back.
Dungeon Master 00:53:16 Welcome back. If you tell them what it's called, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:53:23 Yeah, no, no, totally true. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:53:26 Is that something, so look for, can he just look for the item in inventory? Yeah. Yeah. You should just be looking for the guardians, uh, death cap sphere. How do you share, how do you share in the group? Oh, there it is. Yep. It was at the very top. I scrolled back up.
Dungeon Master 00:53:46 There should be a 10 too, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:53:53 Oh, cool. I see it now. But how do I search? When I search, nothing comes up. Ah, yeah. Guardian Death Caps here. Cool. Oh, cool. It even has an image.
Kaladin Shash 00:53:59 Add inventory. So manage inventory, add item. Like that. I'll just remove it. What's the Jonathan custom right there?
Dungeon Master 00:54:29 Yeah, same with a light splitter. I actually drew that one by hand. Yeah. Pretty proud of it, actually. I was pretty stoked. It doesn't show it when you send it. Oh, I did. I think I sent it in the lower chat.
Kaladin Shash 00:54:31 Yeah. Oh, that's even better. Yeah, I saw the art on the top. Oh, it doesn't show it full size. Oh, that sucks. You said it in the group chat, I think. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:34 Really?
Dungeon Master 00:55:02 I did, yes. I like finding images for reference on things.
Kaladin Shash 00:55:07 That's super cool. Alright, so Jonathan, so we're doing this. We so we didn't just because we became these like almost. Omen nights were really just still operating as we currently are. We didn't get any new. OK, awesome, OK. Love it.
Zariel Torgan 00:55:12 Oh nice.
Dungeon Master 00:55:30 Yeah, you haven't picked up anything new. If you're going to get close, yes.
Kaladin Shash 00:55:37 If it's the if he was close enough to cast without a trace, I want to go ahead and cast. Blessed if we're all trying to move up quickly. Right? What's close like any closer than we currently are, right? Yeah, OK, awesome.
Zariel Torgan 00:55:51 Yeah, have we rolled stealth yet? Because I cast it.
Dungeon Master 00:56:02 But I'm going to say within 40 feet of them is going to be when you're like, because you guys have made camps before, or you've set up posts, if it'd be a little more modern. People always tend to take a watch. So they're not actively looking yet as they set up. But you imagine they're going to start looking out for people.
Kaladin Shash 00:56:08 So we can stage. What's your idea?
Zariel Torgan 00:56:24 I've got an idea. Instead of us having cast Pass Without a Trace and us all go up as a group, I'm going to suggest that Leo and I
Zariel Torgan 00:56:40 climb into the toolbox. And then you stealth up to wherever, as close as you can get. And then, yeah, you just set it behind a rock or something. And then you wait until it's time. And then you throw a little pebble in there to let us know it's time. Then we just burst out. That way we can get close.
Kaladin Shash 00:56:47 Oh, I already love this and you can just climb right out. OK. In. Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:57:07 The toolbox has to stay in place with people in it. It's anchored down while you're inside. It's not so OP that you could put people in it and then sneak them home.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:16 Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah, I'm just trying to break the game. So that's like, okay. Yeah, that's true.
Kaladin Shash 00:57:21 That's rad. I love where your head was already at. That's good. Break the game. Break the game. So that's all right. We got passed without a trace. Honestly, we just need one good roll to get within 10 feet of them if we have to do it within 40 feet. So we'll be able to initiate everything we want.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:45 So yeah, let's just, we'll just get out to 40 feet and then maybe we'll, is there a place that we can like hide behind stuff and just lay low until...
Kaladin Shash 00:57:54 Yeah. And then. Cedric is right now. Is he the large token that's out or the small one? And then it was who's the small one?
Dungeon Master 00:57:54 Yeah, it's a pretty open space. There's like you can. You can get. Like depending on the angle you take pretty close in some spots farther away than others, you can pretty much stay out of view the whole time unless you guys wanted to pounce. Is the large one?
Zariel Torgan 00:58:22 Oh, yeah, you know, he's big. Sorry, I was chewing. What was the what was the pitch?
Dungeon Master 00:58:24 He's just like this cultist dude that's with him. Seems like he's like one of his followers, some of his soldiers.
Kaladin Shash 00:58:27 OK. OK. Art perfect perfect OK. Yeah, let's get let's get close and then I'll cast bless so that we've got at least eight or eight rounds of battle with it or whatever. I said you guys should get a little closer and then we'll all get within 40 feet.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:56 Yeah, I got I got some good range.
Kaladin Shash 00:58:56 Like right before we have to start rolling stealth and I'll cast bless. And then essentially we're. We're just going into people have ranged attacks. I'm saying we could all. We could all just mug him one time and let them start coming. Towards us.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:11 How do I ever? Range is what I do best. Let's see. Is there a natural choke point? So they're just kind of down there. Like, is this maybe narrowed down a little bit here, Jonathan?
Dungeon Master 00:59:38 I'm sorry, what was the question? Yeah, like it does and I'd say like somewhat suddenly, but it's a larger space and they're like just right up at the edge of it because you know, like you probably would have figured if you were over there like that's a pretty good defensible spot one side going over to the cliff.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:40 Like, where exactly are they making camp, and is this a narrow ledge here, like the map makes it out to be? Right. Right.
Dungeon Master 01:00:05 And you can, as you guys are making your way, trying to get closer, sneakier, you do see that this cultist dude goes out on a watch walk every once in a while. He goes up a little bit, looks side to side, goes back, sort of sits and has a smoke, and then he goes back, and then he'll pop back out a couple minutes later, check things out. So he's taking a regular watch, but you never see Cedric sort of leave the camp
Dungeon Master 01:00:33 So you're just watching this dude come back and forth as you guys get ready. So that's a potential high point. You could try to get around on there.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:42 OK. Well, I mean, is this the top of the cave, or is this like an actual ledge up here? Yeah. OK.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:43 What do you guys think? Just full steam ahead? Oh, like this?
Kaladin Shash 01:00:55 Yeah. Good, good twin poke in there. Is that like 20 feet over? How high, how high above is that over Cedric's camp? Awesome. Awesome. Okay. Surround him.
Dungeon Master 01:01:01 It'll be a little bit more difficult. We could say 20. I didn't really think that out, but it could be 20.
Leopold Magnus 01:01:13 Yeah, I was kind of thinking maybe what I initially thought was we could position a trap at the choke point, but if this guy is moving around a whole bunch, that might be pretty difficult. And then, yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:01:13 Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:01:25 Yes, that's what that up. We could easily kind of surround them if you go. If someone wants to try to sit up there, that's more of a. And needing range and using terrain is natural defense.
Leopold Magnus 01:01:38 Yeah, exactly. So maybe one or two of us up here, and then a trap in this choke point, and go from there. I guess, Jonathan, when you cast spells, that's a pretty noticeable thing. You can't really conceal that, right? Or is there some kind of check you can make to do a silent casting?
Dungeon Master 01:01:50 Yeah. And sorcerers can do that, because that's part of their magic. But in general, if it has a verbal component, it's going to be audible. If it has a somatic with a movement,
Kaladin Shash 01:01:56 Correct.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:08 Oh, OK. Right. Yeah, this is a touch. And I imagine it's some kind of rune they have to draw on the ground for this snare.
Dungeon Master 01:02:19 um it'll be like you'll your body has to move in like runes get drawn up and stuff and the material is obviously does it have verbal components
Leopold Magnus 01:02:38 OK. I was looking at it and. Components are SNM is that somatic and something else or? OK.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:38 So what. Nice.
Kaladin Shash 01:02:51 Material, yeah, no verbal. You could. Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:02:51 That's just somatic and material so you don't have to speak when you do it and we'll say once whatever it's set is set like if it's like a trap based spell, it's not going to be visible. Will be easily visible at least.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:07 So do you guys think we should get together, cast Pass Without a Trace, so that way we can try to all get exactly where we want to be, and then attack all at once on a signal? All right, I'm going to use the spell slot. And let's go ahead and roll some stuff. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:03:21 Exactly. It's a 10 minute thing and is it is it concentration or just 10 minutes? We.
Leopold Magnus 01:03:21 Yep.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:35 Um, it is concentration, but I'm going to drop it the moment we attack. So do you want our stealth checks now, Jonathan, or. Okay. God damn.
Dungeon Master 01:03:53 Yeah, if you're going to get close, we'll need some self-checks. Of course you did.
Kaladin Shash 01:04:02 plus 10.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:07 I'm gonna use luck. I don't have luck. I hate it so much as a DM that I can't choose it. Oh god.
Leopold Magnus 01:04:09 Yikes. We're being real sneaky today.
Dungeon Master 01:04:23 Um that one okay, let's see the other ones of it and that 20 balances it out Oh
Kaladin Shash 01:04:37 Unreal. Unreal. Yep.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:37 Oh, shit. Holy shit. Oh, God. That was nice. Hey, how are they? Oh, God. I'm gonna sneak around over there. Oh, shit.
Leopold Magnus 01:04:43 We're just loudly talking about the plan. Zariel and I are yelling about it. I'll put a trap right over there where he's standing.
Dungeon Master 01:04:56 Um I mean, okay, let's just go ahead and roll initiative because this is gonna get bad quickly Um, you guys are approaching you've got past without a trace the shadows mold to your very form You're moving up you're getting ready. This is like the moment you want it to be and then as you get like we'll say within like
Dungeon Master 01:05:23 10 feet, you're getting around the corner. A like stalactite breaks off the top and hits Leo in the head of the armors goes, and he makes a loud buzz. And then Zariel goes real loudly, just like at his face. And then you guys like look up into the right at the very simultaneous moment. And the cultist is just looking right at you. I'm gonna say,
Zariel Torgan 01:05:43 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:05:52 I was I was gonna like want to give you a chance to beat him to uh his like yell but with two natural ones and I'm gonna say he's gonna get something like verbal off he's gonna be like uh boss um so go ahead and roll me we'll make it a
Dungeon Master 01:06:18 D4 plus one rounds until presumably you guys wouldn't know this, but until Cedric joins. I mean, nice for you.
Kaladin Shash 01:06:25 OK. Well, it's rad. Good job to do. No, it doesn't. Did you just get the first chance to correct your mistake? What's your dex reader roll off? We roll. OK.
Zariel Torgan 01:06:26 So does having Kaladin and I both roll natural 20s on our initiative help anything? Yeah, he's like, yeah, it would have been sweet earlier. Oh, shit. Oh, you got me. You got me by two.
Dungeon Master 01:06:58 13. Okay, so we have. Yeah, I'm struggling with my pencil to write down my initiative. But you guys made it.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:00 Oh man, that's so funny. Can you give me a ping where we made it to just to be perfectly crystal clear? Oh, no worries.
Dungeon Master 01:07:28 We'll say down to like this point here. You made it pretty far. Caledon was a little sneakier about it. You made it a little bit, put yourself where you want, but you were less noticed.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:39 Okay. Yeah. Let's see.
Dungeon Master 01:08:02 Okay, first up is obviously Kaladin because that's insane.
Kaladin Shash 01:08:09 That's funny. How far away is he? He is. 15 and a half feet. Uhm? I'm going to. I'm going to cast. Lightning lure. And I want to. I want to drag that guy right in between all of us.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:34 Interesting. Interesting. Nice. Damn.
Kaladin Shash 01:08:38 Just right back to here. Strength, strength save. The fail. I'll take 10 lightning damage.
Dungeon Master 01:08:39 Does he make a deck save? 11. Nice.
Kaladin Shash 01:09:05 Soon soon. I'll have a bonus action attack. I do not right now. I would finish it with that. Yeah Um Just look at just look at zariel be quick
Zariel Torgan 01:09:10 Oh, yeah. All right. I have a kind of silly in-game question, or I guess out-of-game question for Jonathan.
Dungeon Master 01:09:15 Okay, right in between him, he takes 10 damage. Nice.
Kaladin Shash 01:09:38 Mm-hmm.
Zariel Torgan 01:09:42 I don't really wield a blade, but I have this spell called Flame Blade, where it evokes a blade that's magical. I would like to turn into a bear and as a bonus action before I do that, cast Flame Blade, but a bear can't wield a sword. Could it just be like I add some flame damage to my claws or something?
Dungeon Master 01:10:09 Does Flame Blade specify it being like a physical weapon?
Kaladin Shash 01:10:10 Can you? Can you cast?
Zariel Torgan 01:10:16 Yeah, it says you evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. It's similar in size and shape to a scimitar. And so I know bears can't really wield a sword. So if that's silly, then I totally get it. I'm just trying to get some sort of bonus action economy as a bear because right now I got nothing.
Dungeon Master 01:10:37 No, I mean, the components is just a sumo. So you could it doesn't take a weapon to do it. I don't see why not.
Kaladin Shash 01:10:39 in your bear form. I like it. I like it.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:49 Yeah, yeah, it's an entirely magical blade. So yeah, and so I was just thinking I could cast it. And then it says when you cast it, at will, you can just make it appear. So I would cast it. It wouldn't appear. I would use my action to turn into a bear. And then I would pull it forth. And then I would have it ready for when I wanted to attack. Does that sound kosher?
Dungeon Master 01:11:15 Okay. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:19 Okay, it... Yeah, I think, hopefully that's what it does. It also does 3d6 fire damage. But we can also adjust that, because, you know, maybe that's a lot. I mean, it is a second level spell slot, but... Anyway, regardless, I can't do anything else this round. So, I am a large bear with flaming claws.
Kaladin Shash 01:11:20 Flaming claws. Do we go? Do we go flaming claws? Awesome. Love it. Love it.
Dungeon Master 01:11:50 It is concentration. So yeah, it's it's there's a very good chance that you'd lose it and you can't cast a spell as a bear, right? Yeah, there's a big downside to it, it balances out.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:54 Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. I cast it before, so. All right, sweet. Well, I'm here. Bam! So, bear time. And that is my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:12:20 Let's see it. Did you attack him? Oh, you turned into a banger. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I gotcha.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:25 I figure, well, action and bonus to transform into a guy and then cast the bonus, so, you know. It was my plan when we were sneaking. Yeah, yeah, so, because it's a bonus action to cast that, so, anyway. Oh, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:12:47 I missed that you actually turning into a bear part. OK, and nobody else rolled a D4 for how many rounds it would take, right? Because I I did after nobody else did, and I rolled a one, which means two rounds will come in. Yeah. D4 plus one, you know.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:53 Or I guess I'm a southern bear, so it's like... Did you want me to?
Kaladin Shash 01:13:05 Who know? Did you you rolled it? I see one. That's great one round. Start that fight. Yeah, doing it.
Dungeon Master 01:13:20 OK, up next is this guy. He is. I think scared out of his mind and he's going to attack the big scary thing in front of him. Like as a reaction, just instantly. Yeah, it's.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:37 Matt me, bro. It does. Yeah, AC is not good.
Dungeon Master 01:13:51 He's not as strong. 12 doesn't hit, does it? Does? It did. So yeah, this guy is like pretty, pretty low level.
Kaladin Shash 01:13:57 Oh, man.
Dungeon Master 01:14:17 Oh, I guess when he rolls that 10, go ahead and give me a concentration check. That was actually, he rolled a seven on the D8. Yes. War Caster. Okay. Make it on the first one. Uh, does he have more than he has to attack? He'll attack you again.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:20 Oh, Jesus. Let's see. I get advantage because of War Caster. Jesus.
Kaladin Shash 01:14:28 He's like no big deal. Here you go. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:14:47 Natural one, misses. Up next, Leopold. Leopold is silent. No worries, it's fine.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:50 I'm here.
Kaladin Shash 01:15:04 Contemplating his move. Boomer.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:10 Sorry, I was just dealing with a dog. He was eating trash. Is it my go? OK. Yeah, so with my turn, I'm going to, hmm, is this a proper cliff? I guess with a map, what is the surrounding? Because you said it was a cliff, right?
Dungeon Master 01:15:22 Yes. Pretty good timing, actually. Yeah, it's a huge cliff.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:22 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:44 Okay. Any chance there's water at the bottom of it? Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:15:52 As I said before, you've heard faint water, but it doesn't sound like there's anything close. There was like a spot when you had that natural 20, I'll just retro give this to you, when you were walking through one of the tunnels that you heard pretty loud water. But at this point, you hear just like very distant.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:13 I'll move up close to the minion here, and I will do Burning Hands at the first level. And that's a deck save. 16. Wow. Okay, so he takes 4 damage.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:25 Nice. Ooh. Ouch.
Dungeon Master 01:16:31 Uh, he got a 23. It won't let me roll it. You got four damages for damage, you know? Nice.
Kaladin Shash 01:16:34 Darn. I'm just going to go ahead and take a big old swipe. I'm going to assume it's back to me at the top.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:44 And with my bonus action, I'll cast Magic Stone. And that will be my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:17:05 Yes. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:17:06 Awesome. Yeah, I'm just gonna make an attack with, I can't tune to this. With light, it was a light splitter, is that what it was? Yeah, light splitter.
Zariel Torgan 01:17:29 I mean, it's pretty badass to try to kill a guy with his boss's sword. Like, hey, isn't that, like, the reverence? It's mine now, bitch. Nice!
Kaladin Shash 01:17:36 Yeah. 25 hits. Let's see if I can enroll again. And first bit of damage is going to be 8 and then. Let's not roll in the extra D6.
Dungeon Master 01:17:49 Yeah, that easily hits. Oh, it might be busted on that. You just gave yourself like, you could just roll a d6. Nice.
Kaladin Shash 01:18:11 I'll just put 6. An additional 6. Yeah, 8 plus 6, 14. And that's it.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:15 Nice. I have a quick clarifying question.
Dungeon Master 01:18:19 Is that 14 then? Nicely done. OK, Zaryl, you're up next.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:42 The flame blade, it does 3d6 per attack of fire damage. Do I just add that to my claw damage if I hit? So it'd just be the flame damage if I was to hit.
Dungeon Master 01:18:55 uh no i'm gonna say if you've got the flame blade you're doing the flame blade spell as an attack and you wouldn't be doing like your claw attack it would just be the spell yeah because it's just like using the spell instead
Zariel Torgan 01:19:11 That works. Okay. All right. Yeah. All right. I don't know that that average is out to be any better than my claws, because I think I do a 2d6 plus 5 to hit on my claws, which is like 11 average. And then I think 3d6 average is 9.
Zariel Torgan 01:19:37 But it's OK. Anyway, I am going to take two attacks on this piddly guy, because I can't see his boss anymore. Did his boss disappear? Gotcha. OK.
Dungeon Master 01:19:50 Yeah, I was going to say he's in camp and you guys didn't have direct eyes on him. But he was just so he's his token is so big on the map. It didn't really match. You got it. It's.
Zariel Torgan 01:19:59 Gotcha. I'm going to take two attacks then on this little piddly guy with advantage because I am flanking. OK. First is the claw attack. That's going to be an 18 to hit. And then the bite attack. That's going to be 22 to hit. OK. And then that's going to be.
Dungeon Master 01:20:23 It's 16. Oh, Jesus. That was good.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:31 16 on the first attack of fire damage, and 4 on the second. So 20 fire damage as the first one just like explodes, maybe rips an arm off, and the second one just like singes a little.
Kaladin Shash 01:20:38 That's all right, dear. I love that you maxed that first one. Duality, the duality there.
Dungeon Master 01:20:54 yeah the first one like absolutely just like fire through the air you see like you tear his right arm completely off as he raises it up to block the grizzly bears attack and then the second one like thrashes into his thigh and opens him up and he looks very injured on his turn he's gonna panic um
Zariel Torgan 01:21:13 ROAR!
Dungeon Master 01:21:26 He's going to disengage as a bonus action. He's going to run. I'm going to say he's got a half movement. He took the disengage bonus action. And so he makes it as a reduced movement just this way towards the camp.
Kaladin Shash 01:21:35 Opportunity tech. Oh, the action, OK.
Dungeon Master 01:21:51 just panicked, bleeding, missing an arm. He doesn't use an attack. He just keeps moving. Leopold, it's your turn. You think Razzle ate more garbage?
Kaladin Shash 01:22:11 Maybe. Does it again. Love it. That's even better.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:17 Yeah, I got this cat that seems to think that it's a game to jump up on the computer. And then I pick it up and I set it on the floor. And then five seconds later, it's nonstop.
Leopold Magnus 01:22:30 OK, I actually was trying to talk. But I just washed my hands and they were just slightly damp and I couldn't do anything on my phone. Completely unable to do anything on the touch screen, so I was like really frustratedly tapping.
Dungeon Master 01:22:34 Oh no. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:49 Oh that's funny.
Leopold Magnus 01:22:50 Yeah, so for my turn, I am going to double back over here. He's in front of this rock, so he's within range. And I will cast Firebolts as a cantrip. For fuck's sake. That's a 9 to hit.
Dungeon Master 01:23:14 Nice. Oh no. That's not it. That's unfortunate. The natural one on the stealth. The natural one on this.
Zariel Torgan 01:23:20 Leo had wet fingers. Come on. Gotta be close. Hey!
Leopold Magnus 01:23:24 Yeah, I figured as much. Yeah, I've been working with wet hands here. Yeah. So with my bonus action, I'll fling a magic stone and try to smack him again. Still working with pretty low rolls, 14 to hit. Okay, perfect. He'll take eight damage.
Dungeon Master 01:23:45 14 hits, exactly it. Guys, it's a little wimp. He's so so hurt. It's all couldn't get redder. He is still alive though. The fireboat missing was tough. And then.
Zariel Torgan 01:23:54 Oh yeah, finish him. Movement.
Kaladin Shash 01:24:03 Yeah. From anyone. Right, I didn't know I didn't know he was going to run away. It was not my turn yet.
Leopold Magnus 01:24:11 Yeah, that's kind of a bummer. My turn is over. That's it.
Dungeon Master 01:24:16 Okay, any movement from anybody? Yeah, nobody moved on their turn. I didn't know if you wanted to. That's fair. Leopold, still your turn?
Zariel Torgan 01:24:27 Oh. Yeah, I wouldn't have wanted to. And now I do, but it's a little late. Yeah. Well, actually, it's his back, isn't it? Because he's running away.
Leopold Magnus 01:24:41 Yeah, I'll run up and get up in his face. No, but he's got to be pretty close to trapped here then. I guess I'll run into this little choke point, stop him, head him off.
Kaladin Shash 01:24:45 in space.
Dungeon Master 01:24:51 Awesome.
Dungeon Master 01:25:05 I think that works perfectly, because as you sort of come right at the edge of the choke point and you spin on your back foot, like out of the periphery of your vision, you see running out of like his tent full speed ahead. He is bottom of the initiative. Cedric seems to be sprinting towards you. And now you see in person what Kaladin had described to you. And it is truly this monstrous form mutated by this mask.
Dungeon Master 01:25:36 But he's heading right for you, but not his turn yet. And then he's up next. And like I said, he used his movement to get into the fight. Kaladin, it is your turn.
Kaladin Shash 01:26:01 Alright. Mom. Still pretty congested, right? OK. I'm going to you. I'm gonna. I'm gonna go ahead and cast bless.
Dungeon Master 01:26:16 Mhm, everybody's pretty close. Nice.
Kaladin Shash 01:26:29 I'll try to hold that concentration up. This will get everybody a plus four in attack and saving throws. And I will move 25 feet to there.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:39 Sweet.
Dungeon Master 01:26:59 Nice. Haywrecks is Magic Stones concentration. I don't think it's ever come up because you don't normally get hit. Perfect.
Leopold Magnus 01:27:05 Let me double check. It says cast at will. Touch 1 to 3 pebbles. You or someone else can make a ranged spell attack with one of the pebbles by throwing or hurling it with a sling.
Kaladin Shash 01:27:07 I can just. I think, yeah, I think it's once it's cast, they're just in the stones and he pockets him until he wants to help him. Right?
Dungeon Master 01:27:34 What a great spell. So crazy, it seems you can't find a single stone anywhere in this entire place. Completely gone.
Leopold Magnus 01:27:36 Yeah, you guys can throw them. Yeah, and if someone else attacks, my Spellcasting Ability modifier gets added. Not the attacker's attack roll.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:36 Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:27:37 We just need you to stockpile a few of those. We'll all carry him. Give everyone give everyone some bonus action economy. Oh wow, OK. Even better. On the pebble throw, that's great. Stone cavern. They're all gone.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:06 A smooth cave. I'd have to use catapult if they're all boulders.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:07 It's they're all boulders. All right.
Dungeon Master 01:28:07 It almost looks wet. Somebody took a vacuum. Got a plan for everything. Oh perfect, to end Kaladin's turn, Zharial.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:32 I'm gonna... See, can I get past everybody here? Could I try to, like, jump over everybody? And get on the backside? Is that possible? Alright, I just wanna get right there. And as a bear, I have...
Dungeon Master 01:28:41 Yeah, party movement doesn't get in your way, so you can just you can get through your party. Sort of doing running in the. Perfect.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:57 Yeah, I got 40 feet of movement and that was only 30 feet on the ruler, so I figure I'll just go around and then roll back on this side to get advantage if I can. And then I'm gonna take two bear attacks with advantage. First is gonna be a claw attack with flaming claws, that's gonna be at 17.
Dungeon Master 01:29:20 17 misses. Natural 20 hit. Unroll that crit damage.
Zariel Torgan 01:29:21 Oh, ouch. All right, the second one is going to be a natural 20 for 27. All right, here we go. Let's see. That's going to be 21 fire damage on that bite. I want to just bite him right on the butt cheek, just flaming teeth and all.
Kaladin Shash 01:29:28 That'll do it. That'll do it. It's great.
Leopold Magnus 01:29:52 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:29:57 Perfecto. Uh, good, uh, nice damage, sir, on, uh, fuckin', what is Flame Blade, a first-level spell? Second-level spell? Decent! Uh, the bite goes into his, like, he's, like, turned to you and you spin with such speed, you clamp down onto his cap and just deep into the Gaspic and Soleus, he screams out in pain, kicks you off,
Zariel Torgan 01:30:06 Second level, yeah. I wanted his ass, but I'll take his calf.
Kaladin Shash 01:30:09 Was was a good day.
Dungeon Master 01:30:25 ready for his next attack at you. You're on his ire. Next up is... He's too big for you to get that ass right now. He's seven feet tall. Unless we make it canon right now that Zariel's bear form like stands at all times to be the tallest in the room.
Zariel Torgan 01:30:38 I'm a bear. OK.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:53 He always walks on his two feet. He never does anything else. I'm in.
Kaladin Shash 01:30:55 I love that. I like it. No objection. Yeah. Always on two feet.
Dungeon Master 01:30:58 Yeah, he's always doing the weird bear walk. I don't hear any objection. We're going to say that's canon. Perfect. The bear is tall enough to bite his ass then.
Dungeon Master 01:31:19 Up next is a little wiener cultist, and he's going to, as he can no longer get past as there's so much happening right in front of him, turns around, looks at Kaladin from behind, turns back, sees Leopold, is gonna just attack Leopold instead. Don't think I hit with an 11. Didn't think so.
Leopold Magnus 01:31:43 No. Definitely not. Well, sir, that was very kind of you. And I will reach out.
Dungeon Master 01:31:49 What about, what about 14, sir? He's panicked, boxed in, can't go anywhere. It is your turn.
Kaladin Shash 01:31:53 No way.
Leopold Magnus 01:32:11 And I will hit, let's see. I'm gonna do a bonus action. I'm gonna cast a Magic Stone on him. You don't want to waste a spell on it, does it? Funny, but. 13 to hit.
Dungeon Master 01:32:38 It does not hit. You should reload the page or something. Unlucky dice roll.
Leopold Magnus 01:32:39 Oh, Jesus fucking Christ. Yeah, no kidding. One of those nights. I like the music. Very low key. I will
Leopold Magnus 01:33:11 I already did my bonus action. I'm going to create a bonfire underneath Cedric's feet. And that will be five feet cube, which I think we can easily fit between Jesse and I. Dex saves 16. Ah, so he saves it. He takes half damage.
Dungeon Master 01:33:17 Nice. Yes, absolutely. We make a thing. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:33:42 5 damage and I think if he remains there he'll have to make another death save.
Dungeon Master 01:33:49 He's back. No worries, he went quiet really quick. I figured something was up. Yeah, if he ends his turn there, right?
Zariel Torgan 01:33:50 Hey, sorry, the power just went out for like 30 seconds. And then it took like a couple minutes for the Wi Fi. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:33:55 Oh, wow.
Leopold Magnus 01:34:12 Or I guess if he comes back and moves into it. Basically, end your turn and move into it. And that lasts for a minute. I missed a magic stone on the little guy, and I created a bonfire underneath Cedric's feet. He is now dancing in flames, and unless he leaves that area, he will continue to take damage.
Dungeon Master 01:34:20 Yeah, interesting.
Zariel Torgan 01:34:25 Did I miss anything important? Nice. Man, his juicy ass got burned and now his feet got burned. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:34:46 We cooking him. We're having Cedric for dinner tonight. That is my turn. Well, that's why I just went with the bonfire.
Dungeon Master 01:34:59 Nice turn. It's tough about the rolls. Oh, I'm really sorry, man. Cedric. That's a good one. He's not going to stay there, but he's got away the pros and cons. He, seeing that you missed like one of your attacks, decides like, oh shit, I can't be in this fire.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:05 The.
Dungeon Master 01:35:21 dashes to go around to stay within sort of like a safe close range with the bear but he leaves your space so you can make an attack of opportunity if you'd like as he leaves it. 19 just hits.
Leopold Magnus 01:35:33 I am going to cast Witch Bolt. 19 to hit. He'll take 6 damage.
Dungeon Master 01:35:59 Nice. Beautiful, anything else? OK, he having swiveled around was going to use now the only one in range. Is well, I guess the bonfire did just leave. He is.
Leopold Magnus 01:36:00 And that's a concentration spell, so the bonfire drops. Nope, that's it.
Dungeon Master 01:36:30 I'm going to move back into spaces both because there's no longer the threat of the fire. He's going to take, he has three attacks. He's going to take two on Leopold, one on the bear, but he'll use his kick on the bear, which is the stronger one. The first one on Leopold, natural one.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:01 Yeah, that's gonna hit. Yeah. Oh geez. Oof.
Dungeon Master 01:37:02 Second attack. 14 doesn't hit. The kick on the bear. 14 to hit. Nice, okay. You take four plus, oh sorry, 10 plus six necrotic damage, so 16 damage total.
Kaladin Shash 01:37:08 Great. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:31 Let me make that con save real quick. So that's a 10. Oh, that's a success. OK, so we're good. My bear is looking wounded.
Dungeon Master 01:37:43 Yep. Half the damage or ten, whichever's higher. Perfect. Okay, up at the top, that's Kaladin then.
Kaladin Shash 01:37:56 Excellent. I'm going to move forward. Yeah, perfect. 15 feet, 13 feet, whatever. I'm going to cast Burning Hands. I'm going to do it at second level. I'm going to sculpt it so it doesn't hit Leopold. And this will be a deck save.
Dungeon Master 01:38:17 I imagine you'll help it. 12 on the first one. And 15 on the second one.
Kaladin Shash 01:38:40 Meets it, beats it. So half damage for the big guy. That's a good roll though. Yeah. Yeah. And then the run's gotta be gone. He just, he just melts and then the flame continues. And that's the only reason that Cedric takes half damage.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:46 Nice. That is sweet. Sweet.
Dungeon Master 01:38:46 17, okay. That means he takes eight then, because it's rounded down. Yeah, 100%. How do you want to finish the run? Oh, that Cedric doesn't take, yeah, I love that. That's sick, okay.
Kaladin Shash 01:39:10 No, I'll just be cheeky and use my last 10 feet to step backwards again.
Dungeon Master 01:39:15 uh good turn anything else nice okay he's already you're up yeah jesus
Zariel Torgan 01:39:30 Just doing it doing it voice just doing bits now. Oh shit. Oh man. I still got a advantage, right?
Leopold Magnus 01:39:30 The smoldering smoke coming from this guy, I just breathe in, I go, I love barbecue. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:39:45 Evolving. Let's go, Bear Man. Yep. 30, 20 hit. 19 hit.
Zariel Torgan 01:39:57 All right, I'm going to take a swipe with my claws. Dirty 20. And then 19. All right, so let's see. Oh, sweet, yeah, I forgot about that. Nice, 15.
Kaladin Shash 01:40:05 Hits it. Hits. Remember, you also had your plus fours if you needed. Those are in play. Nice.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:26 And 9 for a total of 24 fire damage. As I jump this time to bite his ass cheek, I hop up and I want to be hanging on it. I think it's because... I think it's because...
Kaladin Shash 01:40:42 He just wants to get rid of that.
Dungeon Master 01:40:45 with his ass for no reason at all. Good use of turn, good damage. Oh, that was an update that while you were gone, I said that you did get it. You missed that.
Leopold Magnus 01:40:52 You gotta get that ass.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:54 You said I couldn't get it and now I really want it. Oh, oh shit, okay. Well then this time, this time I'm gonna, I'm just gonna get like that, that tendon right behind his knee. Oh shit, I missed all of that good stuff.
Kaladin Shash 01:41:12 Did Jesse miss all the cannon that has bears always on two feet? Did that really happen? It's even better. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:41:16 Oh, he had to have. I just said that his bear was on a hike one time. And I was like, OK, you could have bit his ass if under one condition, we make it canon right now, that when Zariel is in bear form, the bear is always standing on its back legs and doing that dumb bear walk. And the mute responder is like, OK, if you... Yeah, sure, that sounds great.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:35 Absolutely. Can I have a hat? I want a hat, like a little bowler cap. Oh, that's great. All right. Yeah, I love it. Yeah, I miss all that.
Leopold Magnus 01:41:39 You just have a hat.
Dungeon Master 01:41:46 Little bowl or cup. OK. That's funny, we didn't. You didn't drop out until much after that. I thought I thought you had muted it first and then dropped out afterwards.
Kaladin Shash 01:41:46 I love this. What? What you don't know? That's funny, great timing to stop talking.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:02 Oh no, yeah, I cut out right after my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:42:11 Really funny. Okay. Up next is the wiener cultist, but he's roasted. So Leopold, you're up.
Leopold Magnus 01:42:19 Yeah, with my action, the antenna shoots from back of my shoulder blades, starts charging up a punishing lightning strike, and crackles down onto Cedric. He will take 1d12 damage. So 6 damage with that.
Kaladin Shash 01:42:40 Just deal the damage it's just he has to concentrate the whole time though, but it when it It was keeps ripping
Dungeon Master 01:42:44 Don't you still have to roll to hit? Sick. That makes you much more of a threat. Okay, 6 damage.
Leopold Magnus 01:42:46 No, once Witch Bolt connects, you can use your action to deal the damage. Concentrate, and if I choose not to use it, then it drops.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:07 Isn't it a bonus action? It's not your whole action.
Kaladin Shash 01:43:11 No, it's your whole action. That's the worst part. It'd be so overpowered if then you got a 1d12 for bonus action damage.
Leopold Magnus 01:43:17 That was a bonus action. I'd be dealing it. But with my bonus action, I think I have one more stone up, and I will hurl that at him. Yeah, yeah, last stone. And then wait, do we have Bless? Okay, so I have a 1d4, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:43:32 Do it, I think that's your last stone too as well, right? Yes, you do. So yeah. You hit it no matter what. Hi. Oh.
Kaladin Shash 01:43:39 Yes, plus D4. It doesn't matter what you roll, you're going to get there. Yes.
Leopold Magnus 01:43:49 Nailed him. Oh, and he'll take 11 damage. With precision, the stone hits him squarely between the eyes. Yeah, it would have nicked him in the ear, but instead it just squarely hit him in the head.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:49 Nice. Nice. I love the idea of an attack just barely missing and then Bless helping it. Like it's gonna miss and then Kaladin just kind of moves his fingers a little and just. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:44:13 Boo!
Dungeon Master 01:44:18 like an arcane thread from it, and then you just get to whip it at him at the last second when it misses. Nice, anything else?
Zariel Torgan 01:44:22 Yeah, I love that.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:30 Nope, that's it.
Dungeon Master 01:44:33 Awesome, awesome. It's now his turn. You see he's taking a certain amount of damage at this point, and he starts to go almost fully insane, and his eyes start to explode, and he goes, no, no, I can't lose again, as he's already lost to you once. And you see his body starts to get larger, and more of his skin sort of warps, and you see it physically tears as there's green.
Dungeon Master 01:44:59 growth underneath and he starts physically and visually radiating this like purple smoke in between the sinew of the muscle um and you see he starts to go like uh have you as you've seen before when somebody who is cursed gets pushed to the edge a little too much as you guys had speculated earlier they sort of transform rapidly and you see he is turning into something monstrous but he's gonna take
Dungeon Master 01:45:27 With the Witch Bolt's concentration being an issue, he's going to go all three attacks on Leopold. 10 misses. 25 to hit. It's going to fail.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:45 Mrs. Yeah. Ah, that would hit, but I think I'm going to use you. With yield, what does that give me here? It's a plus. Yeah, that's a plus five, so give me 26 AC.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:57 Jesus Christ, what's that make you like 30 now? Oh my God.
Dungeon Master 01:45:58 Yeah, yeah, yeah. And a 10 with an F2. Oh, I just missed. Damn, OK, those are his three attacks. OK. Can't do anything else at that point.
Dungeon Master 01:46:26 Uh start of the round calvin your turn Right, I see it awesome damn
Kaladin Shash 01:46:31 Sweet. I am closing my distance right now. I'm just going to cast Firebolt. It's going to be a 25 to hit. And that's a 19 of damage. Ripping that. It's like cheating.
Zariel Torgan 01:46:44 Nice! Nice! Jesus! That was fantastic.
Kaladin Shash 01:47:04 And then I'm just going to finish my turn by stepping back another nine feet.
Leopold Magnus 01:47:12 Jesse, does that image in the chat describe your bear form? In Discord. It's got a little walking stick. Yeah, it's got a little stick. It's like walking.
Zariel Torgan 01:47:19 Let me see. Oh, is it the game chat? Oh, yeah. Oh, that's awesome. Is it like holding a... Yeah, it's like holding a little stick. That's great. That's exactly what I'm thinking of.
Dungeon Master 01:47:33 Oh, okay.
Kaladin Shash 01:47:37 It's like a calling a cane. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:47:50 Oh, that's awesome. All right. And then that's me now, right? OK. Ooh.
Dungeon Master 01:47:59 Yes, sir. Would be, except he's now got his legendary action since he's at a certain hit point. He will use two legendary actions to do Light Steel. He'll flash out a wave of dark energy. Any creature within 15-foot radius must succeed a DC 15 con save.
Kaladin Shash 01:48:08 hurting so much. That's good, dude. We're hurting them. We're hurting them.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:35 Ugh. Nine. Yeah, I failed. I got like a nine. And then I just rolled again, because I figured we're going to take damage. And I was doing my con check ahead of time.
Dungeon Master 01:48:37 Or take two. Fail. Yeah. Nice, 25.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:39 Do you see 15? Ooh, that's good.
Kaladin Shash 01:48:48 Yeah. Did you roll? Sorry, did you roll your safe? Oh, it looks like you will. You will take a roll to kind of save any of the four. I'm not within 15 feet.
Dungeon Master 01:49:07 Nice. Yeah. Yeah, Kaladin, what did you roll? I don't see it. Oh, you're way far away. Yeah. It was six, so 10 was the DC. You absolutely surpassed it.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:13 Yeah, I'll roll the D. I'll roll the D4. Oh, I got a 4. What was the DC? Really? Awesome. Well, yeah, heck yeah. Bless worked. I thought it was like 15. Okay, sweet.
Dungeon Master 01:49:38 Wait, well, yeah, it was nine. Are you talking about for the dexterity check? Oh, you're right. It was just a concept. Don't listen to me. It's, um, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:48 No, you said a black mist comes out, and so I rolled a con save. And I rolled a 9. But it only says check on the chat because a bear doesn't have an actual save.
Kaladin Shash 01:49:49 Wrong. Right. No, you rolled some sort of check. Oh, right, OK. I gotcha.
Dungeon Master 01:50:10 Right. Right. 15. Yeah. 18 was enough already. Plus four is 22. Okay. Yeah. The concentration check.
Zariel Torgan 01:50:19 No, I'm sorry, Jonathan. I'm that's my fault. I shouldn't have rolled it without saying if you scroll up, I rolled a 9. And then I thought that was an auto fail and then you were saying, oh, you're going to take. And so I rolled that concentration check to see. Oh, no, no, no. Yeah, just give me the damage. I'll take the damage.
Dungeon Master 01:50:37 Yeah that's what I said you passed but then I thought you said you were trying to retro it for the dexterity check and I was just gonna say there was yeah yeah the damage was six so you took six points and you're not prone and Leopold just takes three like it wasn't it's not a crazy thing but you are
Zariel Torgan 01:50:50 OK. Alright, and then the con save so yeah. Alright, that works. Where are you finding these pictures of bear?
Leopold Magnus 01:50:58 Three damage. What's the concentration roll? Okay, so 10 and it's a con save. It's pretty good, right?
Dungeon Master 01:51:06 uh half the damage or 10 whichever number is higher so it's just going to be dc10 yep
Zariel Torgan 01:51:22 Yeah. Oh, that's great. Shit. All right. So is it my turn now?
Kaladin Shash 01:51:22 Are you just loading more into the Discord chat? That's great. Oh, I was even looking. Just seeing if I could bear it. I love that hat, dude.
Leopold Magnus 01:51:30 It's a little hat.
Dungeon Master 01:51:48 Yeah. 19 hit. 24 hits.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:50 Okay, I'm gonna use half my movement to stand. I am a very hurt-looking bear. I'm gonna move up a little bit to make sure I'm still flanking. And then I'm gonna take another two swipes with advantage. That's gonna be a 19 to hit. And a... 24 to hit. Sweet.
Zariel Torgan 01:52:24 12 on the first and then nine on the second for a total of 21. And I'm just going to try to bite his like back right shoulder blade. I'm going to try to do like a really weak bear hug, like bears, you know, just like wrap around his arms and just.
Dungeon Master 01:52:24 You wrap around, tearing at his shoulders. You see when you tear away skin, it's just that
Dungeon Master 01:52:52 like viney growth underneath as you're tearing turning into like this monster at the end of your turn uh he's going to use another legendary action but it's just going to be to attack you so while he does that leopold what are you going to do while he turns away yeah because he's just going to attack him real quick while he's like on him clawing and biting into his shoulders so like he turns around to attack him and then you'd attack him at the same time
Leopold Magnus 01:53:07 Uh, Oh, okay. So it's to me. Okay. Yeah. I know just with cadence, the, uh, which bolt has been charging up, you know, the, the bears hairs are starting to, to stand on its, uh, stand on its edge with the static. And I'm just going to crackle another one down onto a Cedric.
Dungeon Master 01:53:28 13 for bear, Jesse. Nice, go ahead and roll damage. Then Jesse, the bear, take a 10 damage.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:28 Yeah. That's pretty fantastic. The bear had exactly 10 hit points.
Leopold Magnus 01:53:42 Nine damage. Yeah. And then.
Kaladin Shash 01:53:44 That's great, three connects on one spell.
Dungeon Master 01:53:58 no that's tough uh uh no it was necrotic damage of the jab so just one attack as a legendary action
Zariel Torgan 01:54:00 Yeah, I saw the nine and I thought, heck yeah, and then I was like, oh. All right, I'll bring my guy over here and then put him here. There we go. I just, poof, pop out. Let me roll my concentration check real quick. I gotta roll two, was that two jabs that hit? Oh.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:28 So just one con save? Okay. And then it's advantage, so, okay. Still got Flame Blade.
Dungeon Master 01:54:31 Yep, just one content. Don't matter. Nice.
Leopold Magnus 01:54:45 I think I put the canonical bear in the chat. It's better with your flame blade. That's good, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, that's AI. Yeah, it's good.
Kaladin Shash 01:54:52 Yes. Why did you find that? That's cool. Did you? Did you queue an image generator? Yeah, I figured that last one was a generated one. That's perfect. Can you make that the bear token? Can we can we can you import that image for the bear token please?
Zariel Torgan 01:54:56 Where are you getting these from? With the consistent hat? Are you dro- Jesus. That's insane. That looks really good. That's fantastic.
Dungeon Master 01:55:02 Is it AI generated? That one's perfect. I can do that. I could. I could make that a token that we have permanently around.
Leopold Magnus 01:55:14 There you go.
Kaladin Shash 01:55:22 Excellent, excellent, excellent.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:25 Awesome.
Dungeon Master 01:55:34 Nice, and then you did that 9 damage, I got that. So after your turn, unless you have a bonus, but I think you used all your stones, right? Okay. On his turn, he's actually looking, he's looking incredibly hurt.
Leopold Magnus 01:55:46 I'll use the bonus action to bring up the stones, but I can't do anything with my bonus action.
Dungeon Master 01:55:59 I didn't think it'd go south so fast. And he used his legendary actions. So he's just going to... just do his three attacks. And you guys aren't looking particularly hurt, right? The bear's gone.
Kaladin Shash 01:56:20 No, no, everybody's looking pretty mean right now.
Leopold Magnus 01:56:21 I mean. Yeah, I took three damage.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:24 The bear's the only one that's taken damage. I took 42 points of damage. Not nice.
Dungeon Master 01:56:30 I'm going to say, with as frantic as he is, he's just going to keep attacking Zoriel until he's got a new stimulus as he's like losing it. I'm finally really higher. That's an 18. I mean, well, 26, 18 on the die.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:55 I'm miss miss I am
Dungeon Master 01:56:59 An 11. And a 15. OK, so just the claw attack. 15 damage.
Kaladin Shash 01:57:08 Oh yeah, good job. All right, taking a walk. I love that it kicks that little thing in there.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:20 All right, the first one I tried to miss like a bear, and I didn't realize I wasn't a bear anymore. So like, oh, shit, and I just got smacked. And then con save. That is awesome. So 18, so we're good.
Dungeon Master 01:57:30 Okay, DC 10 Con. 18, yep. Perfect. Start of the round, Kaladin, your turn. This could be close.
Kaladin Shash 01:57:49 All right. I'm going to cast Chromatic Orb at 7th level. Or sorry, at 2nd level. 11th. That's terrible. How about 17? Still misses. Ah, too bad. That just whizzes past.
Dungeon Master 01:58:05 seven holy shit. 13 misses. 17 misses. Any bonus actions or anything?
Zariel Torgan 01:58:07 Okay, thank you.
Kaladin Shash 01:58:27 That's it. No bonus actions.
Dungeon Master 01:58:34 Um, after your turn, he's going to use, uh, all three of his legendary actions. He's got, uh, crushing hug, uh, one creature within 10 feet of him. He must succeed a dexterity 15 saving throw or take a fuck ton of damage and are grappled. Um, go ahead and one of you roll, uh, a D 20.
Dungeon Master 01:59:03 11 or higher, it's after Leopold. 10 or lower, it's after Zariel. It was Zariel. Give me a dex save.
Kaladin Shash 01:59:09 You want me guys to roll or? You guys should roll. One of you should roll it. Sure did. Neutral party. Neutral party. Low sides taking it. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:59:11 You want me to roll, or do you want to roll? Yeah, Kaladin, why don't you roll? You're a neutral third party. Who is the low one? Aw, damn it. All right. Eight.
Leopold Magnus 01:59:15 There you go. I would probably blow on the dice, push it towards Zario. What was it? I don't know. Okay. Yikes.
Dungeon Master 01:59:40 It won't do it. Yeah, whatever.
Kaladin Shash 01:59:42 Plus plus plus a D4. That's alright, it was a good effort, really good effort. That was a really good role. Yep.
Zariel Torgan 01:59:45 Yeah. Yeah. Eleven. Luck. Damn it. Give me that damage. I'm used to it. I like it. Oh my god.
Dungeon Master 02:00:05 Oh shit, 30 points of damage. I rolled four sixes out of five d6 and one of them is a one. DC 15 concentration. Nice.
Leopold Magnus 02:00:08 Jesus. Damn.
Kaladin Shash 02:00:14 Yep, that was a great roll. Just walloped you, man. Oh, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:00:17 Yeah, I don't think... Oh, yeah. Nice. Got the Flame Blade! I'm almost dead. Oh, it's still my turn! What? Does that mean I have disadvantage? No, that just means I can't move, right?
Dungeon Master 02:00:35 But you are grappled. Yeah. Movement is zero and you have disadvantage on attacks other than him, but that doesn't matter. Oh shit, that's actually really unfortunate timing.
Zariel Torgan 02:00:48 OK. OK. Let's see. OK. That's rough.
Dungeon Master 02:01:00 Until the grapple ends, the target takes 5d6 plus 5 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of... Oh, it's Cedric's turn. You're good. No, you know you're good. Yeah, that would be horrible. Okay, continue.
Kaladin Shash 02:01:08 Uh-oh. Okay, okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:01:11 Jesus. Just dump it on him.
Zariel Torgan 02:01:19 I'm just trying to see what my action economy looks like. Is taking one of those stim things a bonus action? Okay. So I'll use my action to flame blade attack. And is that with advantage since I'm still in... okay.
Dungeon Master 02:01:31 Yes. Yeah. He's still harried by Leopold. It's
Zariel Torgan 02:01:48 21 plus to hit. And that's going to be 16 fire damage. And then, was it 2d4 plus 2? Okay. So that's just for me, and that's going to be 7. Okay. And that brings me up to 13. All right, that's my turn. I'm not going to try to get away.
Kaladin Shash 02:01:55 Great role. How do you want to do this? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:02:01 Yes. OK. Leopold, you're up. He's looking very hurt.
Leopold Magnus 02:02:30 I still have Witch Bolt, right? He's gonna take another hit. 2 damage. 2 damage on the Witch Bolt, and then I will use Magic Stone.
Kaladin Shash 02:02:34 So, which will. So sad enough. Sad enough.
Dungeon Master 02:02:35 If you do. Oh. Yep.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:36 Heck yeah. Oof.
Leopold Magnus 02:02:59 since I just brought it back up as a bonus action. For fuck's sake. 15, but maybe with the d4? Nope. Well, he takes 2 damage! Take that, Cedric!
Zariel Torgan 02:03:06 Yeah, 25% chance. Ooh, damn. I love the idea of how it looks when you hit him with a Witch Bolt. Still looks really menacing, it just doesn't do as much damage. It's like... And he's like super sand right now.
Kaladin Shash 02:03:10 No, not at all.
Dungeon Master 02:03:11 No, just messages. Uh, yeah, he's fucking huge.
Leopold Magnus 02:03:27 Yeah, he's juiced up right now, isn't he? Sorry, Zario, I think you might take a killing blow here.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:43 I'm used to it.
Dungeon Master 02:03:46 Um, no, actually, I was worried that I wasn't going to be able to do something that I needed to do. Um, so this is great. Uh, on the start of his turn, he's going to, um, he has never needed to use it, but he's got an ability called calculated loss as a bonus action at the beginning of his turn. And only if he has received damage on that round, uh, he can choose to close the range between an attacker and them, um, without provoking opportunity attacks. So he's going to,
Dungeon Master 02:04:15 You see, as he does this, his body like goes limp for a second as he's like truly on the verge of death. His body goes limp and he almost looks like he's gonna fall and then he gets stiff and hangs there for a moment. The head sort of cocks up looking directly at Kaladin with just shadow coming out of the eye and he will bridge the space to you.
Dungeon Master 02:04:43 And then he is going to cast, not him necessarily. He's going to cast a certain spell. Do you have Calor's Spell? Somebody roll me a d4.
Zariel Torgan 02:04:57 And I spill. Nah, I'm at your red.
Kaladin Shash 02:04:58 No one's, no one's, no one's tying off wizard. I'll roll it. A wand.
Leopold Magnus 02:05:16 Who's doing it?
Dungeon Master 02:05:24 I like that. This will be quick then. You see as this like.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:31 Oh, shit.
Dungeon Master 02:05:33 figure rushes towards you looking just like a corpse at this point. It hits you and its hand reaches up in the air and then a dark cloud forms around it. And in a moment you realize that everybody who is sort of going to move towards you at that moment seems to get stuck in motion, unmoving as this figure casts time stop. And for two rounds you see
Dungeon Master 02:06:03 uh that it Pauses the form sort of laxes for a bit and it tilts its head at you and you hear In almost your head and uh, like very whispery verbally you hear it just go finally a chance to chat
Kaladin Shash 02:06:35 What? That me or?
Dungeon Master 02:06:35 motions the figure yeah talking to you everybody else is frozen it's just you two he goes i've been watching the progress you've made and due to a recent surge in power supply that i had access to i've have a moment to reach out to you
Dungeon Master 02:07:05 you see i was in darkness for a long time sealed for a crime that i don't believe to be mine to have committed you are definitely relation to me but not direct kin but my blood flows through your veins
Dungeon Master 02:07:25 And I feel drawn to you, so I found my way out of the shadow. And you see he looks up in this moment realizing that he doesn't have that long to talk because the spell is going to not hold as long as he thought so. And he goes, never the matter. I want you to analyze the organization you work for. Test where their convictions lie. That is all. Find me when you're ready for the truth.
Dungeon Master 02:07:54 and you see the dark light seems to almost fade from Cedric's eyes and he's sort of he's not dead but you like you see his eyes almost roll back into his head as the time stop will start to end unless you want to sort of get something off to him and trade like a just like one moment of dialogue
Kaladin Shash 02:08:12 Yes. Yeah. How do I speak to you again? How do I find you?
Dungeon Master 02:08:22 And this is when, as he's fading, he goes, well, if you're strong enough to find me next, you'll have means to talk to me. And that's all he says.
Dungeon Master 02:08:41 And then we resume in initiative. Caledon, it's your turn. Everybody starts in motion dashing again. This figure's in front of you. You have a chance to certainly finish it off.
Kaladin Shash 02:08:56 Yeah, I'm gonna raise light splitter over my head and not. No, 17, couldn't quite get there, couldn't get there. Just swing and just missed him. Confused from what I've just experienced.
Dungeon Master 02:09:09 He might, he might, just might, no. Misses. Shit, okay. It was the start of the new round before Zariel's turn. He's gonna use, he's still alive. Um, I'll let you know, with 2 HP he is holding on. He'll do a legendary action.
Kaladin Shash 02:09:35 Yeah. Yep, just me. Maybe. On, is that what you said?
Dungeon Master 02:09:37 and do his light steel so everybody which i think is everybody no it's actually he moves himself away uh leopold are you within 15 feet you're outside of it okay that is less effective calvin give me a dc 15 pawn save yeah
Kaladin Shash 02:10:06 Drew twine. Sweet. I'm I swear I'm holding bless up to that. And.
Dungeon Master 02:10:09 320 passes. You take half damage and you're not knocked prone. Now you take 8 points of half to 4 points of necrotic damage. Nice. Zariel, your turn.
Zariel Torgan 02:10:33 So it says I'm 30 feet away. So I'm going to move up to 30 feet. And I'm going to, let's see, I'll pull forth my flame blade. But now it's just a flaming bear claw that I hold on to. And I'm just going to, with advantage.
Kaladin Shash 02:10:38 Yes, yes, let's roll it. He's going down no matter what.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:01 Come on, 22 to hit. I just want to reach out and I want to, yes.
Dungeon Master 02:11:04 Like you hit. Unless you roll 11 and negative one. Sorry, I'll. Finish him.
Kaladin Shash 02:11:09 No.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:20 I reach out with my flaming bear claw hands and like when you're taking a scoop of ice cream across like the top of the container and it just removes all of that and it leaves like a scoop line, I'm doing that with my bear claw hand and I'm just scooping his whole ass out, cutting him in half. And then he's just, he's gonna.
Dungeon Master 02:11:37 Mm-hmm. You bisect him at the aft level. It's like his full head, abdomen, his pelvis, and then he cut him in half. So his legs follow two different directions.
Leopold Magnus 02:11:46 Stoopid as ass.
Zariel Torgan 02:12:01 sear marks on either side as I drop the flame blade. And I say, yeah, you hate to see it, but sometimes things have to be done. And I'll just blow on my bare hand. That's it.
Dungeon Master 02:12:20 Uh, nice. That ends initiative. You have this like warped monstrous form, sort of lose tension as it's instantly like just scream of pain in a quick moment that just cuts out to nothing in the next second. And he has, like I described, his weirdly large portion of the body
Dungeon Master 02:12:48 laying in front of Caledon and the legs sort of splayed out sideways two different directions in front of Zariel. Yeah, I mean, you've already seen him. He's got the mask on. No investigation needed.
Kaladin Shash 02:12:58 Um, can I do an investigation on, is he wearing the mask that we've been looking for? Can I, can I grab it? Yes.
Dungeon Master 02:13:17 Do you intend to take it off his body? As soon as you lift it off, you see his body instantly starts to turn to stone.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:21 Whoa. Oh shit.
Dungeon Master 02:13:29 just cracks and and turns white and gets sapped of color and bleached spreading from like a center point out until the whole thing is stone and due to his body being so far damaged already it seems like it starts to collapse in on itself and the chest sort of crumbles and goes down in his arm that was like sort of up sort of breaks midway between the radius and ulna just like half the arm is up now uh
Dungeon Master 02:13:56 Yeah, but you hold this mask in your hand and you feel a surge of power. It almost feels like it runs through the veins of your arm into your chest, radiating this warmth into your body. It feels desirable.
Kaladin Shash 02:14:12 Does that feel dangerous? Does it feel... Okay. And do I smell the same sweet flowers now as well? Okay. Right.
Dungeon Master 02:14:26 Yeah they're pungent now that the mask is exposed you're looking into because remember it's like a lower face gas mask except the chamber that you're breathing in is just like plant life and flowers and it's got like humid air so it's like just that's what you're breathing in the whole time.
Kaladin Shash 02:14:52 Would I? Would I have any other now that I've got a chance to actually hold it and look at it? Would I have any other sort of? Recognitions of anything. OK. OK. Uhm?
Zariel Torgan 02:15:08 Yeah, I reckon that's a good decision.
Dungeon Master 02:15:13 Not at this moment, nothing comes to you.
Kaladin Shash 02:15:22 I don't know what else we need to do, but we should take this back to the medical bay.
Zariel Torgan 02:15:36 I'm going to run over and I want to just look at the dead other guy. Is there any stuff? Oh, he got melted, didn't he? So he's probably... Yeah, I'll grab that. Did we...
Dungeon Master 02:15:46 Yeah. Ash. He didn't have anything magical on him though. So like in the pile of ashes, you don't see anything either. It's maybe like a couple silver or something, you know, something really minimal.
Kaladin Shash 02:15:54 It's all gone. It's all gone.
Zariel Torgan 02:16:06 Did we want to like, well, I guess I should clarify. Did I hear or was it relayed to me what they said about jumping in the water that you can or whatever that was? Do we want to maybe like go a little further?
Kaladin Shash 02:16:24 We heard that, yeah, I relate that. Do we, while we're here? Yeah, can I, I'm just gonna kind of tuck the mask under like my one little breastplate or whatever. Can we, yeah. We should look for the source of water. Does anyone hear anything?
Leopold Magnus 02:16:24 Indeed. Let me take a listen.
Leopold Magnus 02:16:54 Jonathan, can I walk over to the edge, kind of the cliff, and just hang my head over it? See if I hear anything.
Dungeon Master 02:17:04 Yeah, go ahead and give me a perception check.
Zariel Torgan 02:17:08 Do we want to take a short rest, or if not I can cast Healing Spirit, and that's 5d6 healing.
Kaladin Shash 02:17:12 We should, I think, maybe hang on to that. Like I said, I don't think we're in a rush. I think we should short rest if we're gonna try to figure out where this water is deep enough to jump in, or what was the, I wrote it exactly down, let me see.
Leopold Magnus 02:17:20 I'd definitely do a short rest. Oh, man, I like Honestly Kaladin I don't hear anything down there
Dungeon Master 02:17:43 yeah leopold the water sounds uh four is not a natural one at least you know um it's really far away like you don't even really take into account that this is a cliff and you might hit more cliff if you don't get it right you're just like yeah the water's too far away
Kaladin Shash 02:17:43 Yeah. Find the water you can jump in. That was it. Yeah, let's just keep venturing down there. I guess we want to. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:17:50 Sounds like dirt. Yeah, yeah. So are we committing to the short rest? So we'll do that.
Kaladin Shash 02:18:13 Short rest. Yes, short rest.
Leopold Magnus 02:18:17 Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
Dungeon Master 02:18:35 You guys take a short rest. Do it.
Zariel Torgan 02:18:36 Nice. Damn. And then that resets, and so does that. OK. All right.
Dungeon Master 02:19:02 All righty. Do you guys, which would, are you going just continuing with the cliff or are you going, you had heard a spot prior when you were going through the tunnels? Got two options.
Zariel Torgan 02:19:13 Yeah, what was the exact phrase again? So...
Kaladin Shash 02:19:18 The exact phrase was just. It's really simple, it's all it was was. Find the water you can jump in. Hours waiting for us on once we're out.
Zariel Torgan 02:19:42 These guys weren't on our team, and they were gonna jump into some water, supposedly because they wanted to, and it was good for their cause. So if we find... Yeah... Do we still wanna do it, or...? Yeah, that might just be like, hey, thanks for that mask, I guess you can die now.
Kaladin Shash 02:19:51 Right. Right. I'm worried. Yeah. Are we heading towards some entity that would not grant us power but, you know, not enjoy us at all? Right. That's what I'm worried about.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:12 Well, we could proceed carefully, you know, I mean.
Zariel Torgan 02:20:13 What do you guys? Yeah, do you guys want to just check it out for giggles? Or do you want to just get back with the mask and then come back later? Or what do you think? All right, well, hey, let's throw the mask in the toolbox, right? That way it's secure.
Kaladin Shash 02:20:23 No, if we can, if we can, we don't have to jump in the water, but if we can find a spot where we think it fits the description, we can always sort of earmark it and then come back and we don't have to find it. I like that idea. That's a good, that's good.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:42 That's a great idea.
Zariel Torgan 02:20:44 All right, so I'll open it up and then. It's not like extra planar, is it, the mask? Okay. All right, so I'll just open it up. I'll say the command phrase to open it. It's gonna be stinky donkey.
Kaladin Shash 02:20:56 No, it's got no other dimension to it.
Zariel Torgan 02:21:15 And then it opens up, and I'll drop the mask in, and I'll close it up. You got to take pride in your craftsmanship and your ability to affect the world around you. Although I really do feel like Leo should have this, because it's very up his alley.
Dungeon Master 02:21:22 OK, I like it. Portable storage already.
Kaladin Shash 02:21:39 you.
Leopold Magnus 02:21:45 Oh, that's OK. You'll let me borrow it, won't you, Zario?
Zariel Torgan 02:21:49 Oh, of course. Of course I will. On that natural 20 perception check way back when, does that give me a rough idea of where we were when I heard that? Or should we do fresh survival checks to get back?
Dungeon Master 02:21:59 We'll do just another round of survival check just without like the pressure. It'll be pretty easy to see.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:16 All right, well then, what do you guys think? Do you want to head back now or do you want to do something else before we go? Sweet. All right, well then I will do survival. Somebody want to give me advantage?
Leopold Magnus 02:22:27 I don't have anything on my mind. I'd say we could go.
Kaladin Shash 02:22:34 Yeah. I'll assist you.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:50 Sweet. Good. 16.
Dungeon Master 02:22:57 You see nice, yeah, it takes just a little bit of time to get there because it's like somewhat far away. But you guys do find your way back. Hold on, let me get to the right one.
Dungeon Master 02:23:22 You guys are all in the same tunnel, presumably, but as you sort of backtrack, you find that the tunnel you had. First found like the quick route through this center spot right there. The closer you pay attention as like a loud sound of rushing water underneath. Yeah, what's the range on fireball?
Kaladin Shash 02:23:45 Could I shoot a fireball down there? 120 feet. My old wizard did.
Dungeon Master 02:23:59 Um, yeah, I'll see that 120 feet is is pretty high if you're thinking about like Height in a cave system. So i'm going to say that's like more than enough But we'll say it's stretching it like you can't tell from this distance how far it went before it was snuffed but like maybe close to like the max distance, but eventually
Zariel Torgan 02:23:59 I thought you had, like, Spell Sniper. Oh, gotcha.
Dungeon Master 02:24:22 as like the firebolt shoots down you see it's swallowed by water in just a flash you see the white of sort of the rapids rushing through this underwater system.
Kaladin Shash 02:24:35 OK. That looks that looks challenging. I don't know how to get down there.
Zariel Torgan 02:24:36 Hmm. Well. Well, I could I could turn into a big old spider and I could climb down there. If we're just looking to take a peek.
Kaladin Shash 02:25:04 Yeah, would you get dark vision? Jonathan, as that fireball went down, could I see, did I just see a shaft or did it open up?
Zariel Torgan 02:25:08 Uh, yeah, as a giant spider, I have darkvision and blindsight. Up to 10 feet.
Leopold Magnus 02:25:15 Well, that sounds like a good idea.
Dungeon Master 02:25:25 A shaft for most of it, but like that far down in that dark in general, like eventually the sort of light ring that follows the firebolt as it chases the shaft down, that eventually expands to where you can't see. But because it's like a larger space underneath the shallow space, you don't see where the next line was. Like it opened up to a bigger space, but you don't know how big.
Kaladin Shash 02:25:36 Right. OK, OK, cool. Yes, let us know. We wait right here, comrade.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:54 So yeah, I guess, what do you guys think? Spider it up, zip down there, see if I see anything cool. All right. Well, nobody swallow me while I'm a spider. I'm going to go down here.
Leopold Magnus 02:26:16 Well, Zariel, that's mostly you that do the spider swallowing, so not much to worry about.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:24 There's definitely some psychological issues going on with that, but I'm just gonna move past it. I'm a giant spider, and I am going to just... What is this? Oh, is this the spider? Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:26:35 Why is there a thing next to it? It's dumb. Yeah, it just doesn't have a picture for some reason.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:49 Yeah, my form kind of, like, melts a little and, like, spreads wide as the giant spider... Oh, here we go. Oh, it's annoying I can't send it to the game chat like I used to be able to. Okay, anyway, I'm gonna, like, and scuttle down the thing.
Zariel Torgan 02:27:21 See what I can see. I'll try to be relatively quiet. I don't want to be like super loud. Oh, nice. Yeah, it can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings without needing to make an ability check.
Dungeon Master 02:27:29 There we go. I reloaded my page and it seemed to work. Yeah, at first it's pretty easy. As you're making your way down, obviously I feel like the giant spider has spider climb as its ability.
Dungeon Master 02:27:48 So I'll say like 95% of the way is perfectly fine for the spider, but it doesn't become an issue of like the surface or how straight or sleek it is as you inspire for and make it, you know, 50, 60, 70 feet down. Eventually the walls start to feel really wet as you are getting low enough that you're getting like spray of the water as it hits certain rocks and like sort of splashes up to the top of the
Dungeon Master 02:28:18 the tunnel that opens up into this space, which you see with your dark vision as well. It is a wider tunnel, but it's not like an enormous space. It's like maybe 20 feet end-to-end, and it's like a pretty straight cylinder, and it goes into darkness even past your dark vision, not your spider vision. But it just goes like
Zariel Torgan 02:28:39 Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:28:39 Nope.
Dungeon Master 02:28:43 who you don't know how far, but it's really fast moving water. When you look into the water, it's difficult to tell like how deep or not it is, but. It's not like a stagnant pool that if you hit at full speed with like break your legs or anything like that. But if you want to keep going, I am going to require like a. Athletics or acrobatics check for the spider to like not lose its balance on the wet surface.
Zariel Torgan 02:29:11 That all sounded great. I giggled like a little girl because Rex put it in the chat, a picture of a spider eating a spider. That was so good.
Dungeon Master 02:29:21 That deserves to be shared, Rex. He's sleeping too. He just Leopold did that silently throughout a silent image. So you can keep going down to try to get a better look or you can go back to the party.
Leopold Magnus 02:29:33 Just don't fall asleep. I didn't wanna interrupt, I was enjoying the...
Kaladin Shash 02:29:35 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 02:29:42 Oh, fuck, that's great. Yeah, I'll risk it for the biscuit. What do I need to roll for getting down there? What'd you say it was? I don't have either of those. All I have is dex or strength.
Dungeon Master 02:29:55 Acrobatics or Athletics? At first it'll be like a DC 15. If you keep going, it'll be a DC 20. Dex or Strength? Up to you. 22. You make it more of the way down.
Zariel Torgan 02:30:12 Okay. I'm going to fall in. Oh, 22. Is it?
Kaladin Shash 02:30:20 Well.
Dungeon Master 02:30:23 And as you get closer, you can tell that you might take a little bit of damage jumping into here, but you would survive the fall, certainly, if you just, like, jumped down that opening. But even at this sort of far down, and you're even, like, sort of going over the cusp, you know, when you turn the corner, so you're, like, getting to look down the tunnel a little bit, too, it goes into the dark. You can't see the end of it.
Zariel Torgan 02:30:52 So there's a tunnel down here before you hit the water that's an opening. Interesting. Interesting.
Dungeon Master 02:30:57 No, it is the tunnel that is the water, like that, like water system. It goes until you can't see anymore, but the water itself is deep enough that if you jump in from the shaft, you wouldn't die.
Kaladin Shash 02:31:21 Good to know.
Zariel Torgan 02:31:23 I want to squirt out, like, ten spider babies into the water. And... see, nah, just kidding. I can't do any of that shit. Uh, okay, I'll scurry back up and report... for fertility. Is that just a D20? Why am I not a male spider? I guess I can't have babies if I'm a male spider, huh?
Leopold Magnus 02:31:27 Yeah, they do.
Dungeon Master 02:31:29 Yeah, as a little as a male spider creeped up on you when you weren't paying attention. As you're the bigger one, female spiders are the bigger ones, I'm sorry, but. Little man spider tried to fuck you and you stepped on it and it died.
Zariel Torgan 02:31:53 Yeah, I do think it's... I do like... I was gonna say that's the one I ate. Oh, shit.
Dungeon Master 02:31:59 So no babies, but. You turn around, you go up the shaft all the way to the top. I don't believe a spider can speak, so this big spider emerges out of the hole in the ground and like starts. Like at you, just like making some like whisper sounds, some chittering with the fangs.
Kaladin Shash 02:32:02 You ate it.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:29 I'll drop my form. And I'll be me. All right, well, we could hop in if y'all want to do that. There was one other spider down there. Not sure what it wanted, but it didn't last long. Anyway.
Leopold Magnus 02:32:50 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:54 There's a tunnel it like the water flows through kind of like a volcanic tube system kind of ish We can hop in I mean I feel like It could be cool but also we could die so I'm cool with either
Leopold Magnus 02:33:19 Well, what do you say, Kaladin? Well, let's go then. So this would probably be beneficial if we had a boat, right?
Kaladin Shash 02:33:20 I mean, yeah, we can. We can just chase the rabbit hole. If you guys want. If you guys want to keep advancing like that, let's go.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:35 Oh shit. Uh, sure. You gonna make a boat?
Leopold Magnus 02:34:00 Yeah, I'm going to make a boat, right? I'm going to turn to Zario. Zario, would you mind putting down that toolbox? I think there might be some supplies in there. I could whip us up some transit. No, I'll just shuttle the materials up the toolbox, right? Because they didn't have boards and all sorts of things down in there, supplies. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:34:11 Absolutely. Anything.
Kaladin Shash 02:34:12 Is the boat is the boat going to fit down the hole? Right, I'm talking about down. Great.
Dungeon Master 02:34:25 Yeah, you can absolutely make stuff in there. True. But possible.
Leopold Magnus 02:34:30 Yeah, well, and I guess that if I'm building something larger than a medium-sized character, I'd have to cart the supplies out of the toolbox and construct it outside of the workshop.
Kaladin Shash 02:34:46 I was just thinking if you make a boat, can is the whole of the shaft large enough for a boat, Jonathan? Nose down, yeah. OK, I'm on.
Dungeon Master 02:34:54 If you tilted the boat. Like. Vertical. Those down you could drop down with it and like just hope that it didn't explode in the rapids, but like. No, it's possible for sure.
Leopold Magnus 02:35:12 I'm gonna try and make us a boat and kind of put my last finishing touches on it. I'll put a nice Viking crest on the bow, the emblem. Yeah, what would that be?
Kaladin Shash 02:35:26 Yes. It's probably like a...
Zariel Torgan 02:35:26 While he's doing that, can I? Oh, go ahead.
Dungeon Master 02:35:26 Go ahead and give me a, just give me like a tinkering check. I think you have a tinkering check. Isn't there something in there that talks about that? Am I making that up? That's the one where you can like instantly do stuff. Uh,
Leopold Magnus 02:35:43 I mean, it would make sense, but I don't know if I've seen it. I have magical tinkering. Yeah, it's just imbue a tiny non magical object with magic. Yeah, intelligence is quite high. I have the right tool for the job, which gives me any of the tools I'd need.
Dungeon Master 02:36:00 I don't want to make it. You're more smart than anything else, right? Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:36:14 or the ability to make the tool.
Leopold Magnus 02:36:16 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:36:20 Since it's your highest chat, your highest check. We'll say it's like investigation arcana, sort of like intelligence plus proficiency. But like using the logic that you're using your innate like built in memories that you don't have and all these different things you put together, but you like you construct a boat. So go ahead and give me a just we'll just make it arcana.
Leopold Magnus 02:36:47 Okay. 16. Excellent.
Dungeon Master 02:36:53 Yeah. You can make a boat with a 16, right? Um, you guys watch him. He takes like it, it's not a fast, right? Like it takes like a full hour, but you see a Leopold is just like hauling out supplies from this whole, uh, starts constructing it with like, he's got like, like very like gear based drills where he like puts it to something and it uses multiple leverage points of like different wheel cog ratios where he can like screw in things faster.
Dungeon Master 02:37:22 And he's like using these things and constructing. You guys are just kind of like Matt watching. You guys can have like a little chat if you'd like to. Yeah. Go for it. Yeah, you can get the shorter end. Leopold, Leopold can't, but you guys can.
Kaladin Shash 02:37:23 That whole hour short resting. I'm just going to be bugging him while he's taking a short rest. Uhm?
Zariel Torgan 02:37:33 I was hoping to take a short rest. Is there not enough time for that? Sweet. Yeah, I took one.
Leopold Magnus 02:37:42 Yeah. Oh, OK, I thought we had already done that, but OK, I'll take that back because I only. No, I don't need another one. Second one, OK.
Dungeon Master 02:37:51 You had already got it before, or are you taking another one? Just power gaming.
Kaladin Shash 02:37:58 Zoriel. That's good. Zoriel, I have a question for you. What
Zariel Torgan 02:38:08 Get my spider form back. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:38:29 I know we spoke briefly, but what do you feel like is going on with your... I saw your wounds and the metal you had in your arm.
Zariel Torgan 02:38:40 Well, that's a good question. At first, I was in, what's it called? Denial. I thought, you know what? I can't see it right now. Maybe I made it up. And then I saw your potion. And I thought, well, you know, maybe
Zariel Torgan 02:39:03 I was in a bad accident and I lost many limbs. And so I might be like Inspector Gadget. Well, that's not relevant. I might be like somebody with a lot of fake stuff. You know, hence the skin. But I really don't know. I've got such a fun accent and I do so much nature stuff.
Zariel Torgan 02:39:32 I mean, I almost have to be alive, right? But, I don't know. Yeah, I mean, this whole thing has come as quite a shock.
Dungeon Master 02:39:40 That's a good question.
Kaladin Shash 02:39:46 I don't know, you eat, you eat, right? You drink water? Yep. Is yet asleep, yes?
Zariel Torgan 02:39:59 Yeah I mean I eat, sleep, shit, you know. My hair is growing right now. Well I guess Jonathan, do I do those things? Yeah, yeah I do all those things and I'm perfectly confident about it. Yeah my nose just keeps growing.
Dungeon Master 02:40:12 As far as you know, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:40:17 Yeah. You're a real boy.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:28 Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure what, I mean, just because we see a little bit of something under my skin doesn't mean that I'm fundamentally not what I think I am. I mean, it does lend some credibility to that assumption, but I don't know. I feel like we need to do some more investigating.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:53 To be honest, right now I'm kind of escaping thinking about that, focusing on this mask and this hole and that sexual chemistry I have with that other spider. I'm just trying to move past it.
Leopold Magnus 02:41:13 I think I just put the finishing touches on the boat and I kind of dust my hands off, stand back and I say, well, Zario, Kaladin, what do you think?
Kaladin Shash 02:41:18 Okay, very good. Yes, that's a lot to take.
Dungeon Master 02:41:19 Anybody? Looks good, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:35 How does it look? Does it look good? Damn. So, uh, we're just gonna drop this boat in, and then, like, are we gonna jump after it, or...?
Leopold Magnus 02:41:54 Well, yes, I didn't quite think about that, but I suppose we better run alongside it and hop in and out around the same time we drop it in the water.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:05 Yeah. All right. The physics of that sounds really dangerous. Maybe one of us jump in first, and then we can hold onto a rock or something, and then down river a little bit. And then we can drop the boat, and then that person can catch it, try to wedge it.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:34 for a second until everybody else jumps in. Maybe something like that. Well, I don't know, I guess... Out of character, I'm just conceptualizing this as like a tiny hole and we're gonna try to drop this ship or this boat
Leopold Magnus 02:42:46 Well, if you think that would be wiser, yeah, we could give that a shot. Yeah, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:43:02 down the hole. If we're in it, I feel like that would hurt a lot more but I don't know. Oh... I actually like that a lot yeah. Yeah I'm...
Kaladin Shash 02:43:07 I'm imagining like when kayakers go over like waterfalls. Like we just need to hang on and we'll pop up. Yeah, yeah, we're just, we're just, yeah, yeah, exactly. Like that, like that.
Leopold Magnus 02:43:20 But to get in it, I think we have to do a bobsled-style embark where we run alongside it and we all jump in at the same time. Yeah. Very smart. Very smart.
Zariel Torgan 02:43:30 Yeah, I'll do a thorn whip and just try to lash us all together. Do we need to make any sort of check, Jonathan, to get the boat in the hole and get us all situated?
Kaladin Shash 02:43:37 There you go.
Dungeon Master 02:43:46 No, I really love it so far. You guys use thorn whip to lash it back and forth to keep you guys secured to it. Sort of bobsled maneuver. You get ready, you tip it down. Do you guys jump in? It fits perfectly. You guys can do like one person on the side, side and like behind to sort of all pull yourselves in once it goes in if you need to or to stay out to hit the water before that.
Dungeon Master 02:44:13 Um, whatever you choose you like are pretty confident. This is gonna work, but let me know if you're sending it in Nice, uh as everybody jumps in the wind goes flying by your ears. It's just the the loush As like you're falling like you hit a little bit of a chip here and there and you get pushed back And you keep going and again, it's like
Leopold Magnus 02:44:21 I'm staying. I'm not getting out.
Zariel Torgan 02:44:22 Yeah, we're all in. All in.
Kaladin Shash 02:44:23 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:44:41 over a hundred feet but as you guys go in give everybody give me a dexterity staving throw to see if you can sort of reduce it's not going to be a lot of damage but just minimize the damage you take you guys all pass so you'll take half damage uh you each take three points of damage bludgeoning damages you hit the water hard but then the rapids are
Leopold Magnus 02:44:53 Boom baby.
Zariel Torgan 02:44:55 Eyyy.
Dungeon Master 02:45:07 crushing you side to side it's in your ears and in your face and your nose and you're sort of spitting it out as you go funneling through this water system um go ahead and give me uh you guys aren't concentrating on anything anymore let me get rid of that give me a strength check to pull yourselves into the the boat as it's like rushing through this tunnel system with the current
Kaladin Shash 02:45:23 Yeah, I dropped my con on my token. Would we have any advantage with the vine whip holding us someplace a little bit? That's great. That's great.
Zariel Torgan 02:45:27 Strength save. Seven.
Dungeon Master 02:45:41 Uh, not advantage, but all the dc is much lower. It's much easier to get in You both
Dungeon Master 02:45:57 Get in the boat, Leopold and Kaladin. Pull yourself in, no problem. Zaryl, you didn't get in with your first attempt. You're still getting pulled. Let's say, like, you were on the side of it and you had a harder time getting in because it got bumped over and you almost got crushed as you're getting, like, rocketed through this little, like, lava tube. Go ahead and give me another strength save. You're at one failure and you guys in the boat can help him on this one.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:23 Nine. Could I, could I guide myself? Oh. All right. Here we go. So I'm rolling it again.
Leopold Magnus 02:46:23 So it's this. What do we roll another one to help him? As you say, can I reach out, grab him out of the water, pull him in? OK.
Kaladin Shash 02:46:28 Oh, we hard failed. Oh, that's all I have to do? Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:46:30 I was going to give him give him an advantage on this. You can guide yourself. If he fails again, you can, but we'll say you're just aiding him on this one. Yes, but yeah, you have it because you had advantage. No.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:53 Okay, good, because that's a natural one. I'm like, oh my fucking god.
Kaladin Shash 02:46:57 Oh, double ones. Snake eyes, got the snake eyes. Golly.
Leopold Magnus 02:46:58 Uh-huh.
Dungeon Master 02:47:00 Um, okay, um, gotta punish the devil on that one. The dice gods don't want you to succeed. You are struggling, your Thorn Love breaks off because you hit another rock as you're running through Leopold. You had sort of gone to it first, but I'm gonna say give me like a strength check with disadvantage to see if you can pull him up.
Leopold Magnus 02:47:24 All right, I guess I already rolled one, so does that count as one of the checks? I'll take my odds, 13, and then am I blessed? Got it.
Zariel Torgan 02:47:30 Now.
Dungeon Master 02:47:32 Yeah, unless you want to roll two new ones. I don't believe you guys are blessed unless somebody cast it.
Kaladin Shash 02:47:49 No, we're not blessed right now. That was just in the battle.
Dungeon Master 02:47:55 uh 13 is it's close i was gonna say 15 something he's not going to like fall off on this round you've got a hold of them but uh zariel one more chance normal strength save doesn't have to be um disadvantage or anything but yeah you still are having trouble getting into this boat
Zariel Torgan 02:48:07 I'm going to focus my energy as I'm waterboarding myself, not able to get up. My shirt has moved up above my face, so I can't see. I'm going to guide myself. That's a nine. And then
Leopold Magnus 02:48:31 Oh God
Kaladin Shash 02:48:32 Yeah, I see. Just let, just let go. Can I, can I have a reaction? Can I do? Can I, can I do? Is he gonna, is he gonna fall out now? Was that his second, was that his second fail?
Dungeon Master 02:48:34 Oh no. It was the Z15. That was the first one that you didn't get. At this point, he's gonna start falling out. Yeah, it's gonna be on Leopold to save him if he
Zariel Torgan 02:48:36 Uh, 1 for a 10. Just leave me. Just leave me. Jesus. Oh, shit.
Dungeon Master 02:49:04 But you can do something since you haven't done anything. Yeah, is that a role to hit? Unless he willingly fails, which then it just works, right? Oh, I love that.
Kaladin Shash 02:49:08 Can I cast lightning lure and try to just grab him and pull him back into the boat? It's a strength save. And then it just works. And it's because it's evocation, I'll just sculpt it to do no damage.
Dungeon Master 02:49:35 Good move. You throw out this lightning lure and in the light and the water, that seems like a really bad idea. Uh, especially cause he's like hanging in it, but you are so masterful with this spell. You've been using it all day. Uh, you sculpted around the water and him, so he doesn't do damage, but like wrap it around itself and you whip him up into the boat. Um, and then you're like,
Zariel Torgan 02:49:43 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:50:03 plummeting through this space it's like sometimes you're at a 45 degree angle straight down and then it goes up and it's to the side and you're getting rocketed back and forth and if the water's going up and over and sort of into your boat so some of the time you're like bucketing it out and you're going for like what feels like forever 10-15 minutes 20 minutes it slows down a bit and the water comes to like
Dungeon Master 02:50:28 gradually over time, a slower just sort of flow through this tunnel that's like tall enough for like Leopold to sit upright, but not much taller than that. And sometimes Leos, I really get down to not get hit by like the ceiling. But you guys are in your boat in this dark tunnel, sort of slowly drifting through this lava tube.
Kaladin Shash 02:50:54 Oh my gosh. Let's do the boat, make everything glow.
Leopold Magnus 02:50:56 So it's pretty dark. I think I have the ability to create a light with one of my magical tinkering. Yeah, five foot radius. So is there any small items that I could, anyone has on them? Oh, does that work? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:51:27 I don't know. I love that. Yeah, you create a little light for yourselves.
Leopold Magnus 02:51:27 And it says tiny non-magical objects, so maybe I'll just do the bow. Yeah, exactly. Kind of the Viking ornament that I put on it. And I will imbue it with a radius of light.
Kaladin Shash 02:51:32 of a bow with the top bow, top plank, whatever.
Dungeon Master 02:51:49 um slowly flow into the darkness you see uh i've just found something that works really well for it so i'll put you on this map
Kaladin Shash 02:52:02 I'm just going to put this. We've been floating for quite some time now. How far do you think this goes? And do you think we're still under the dome?
Zariel Torgan 02:52:23 Do we have a way to do some sort of, I guess, I'm not sure. Yeah. Yeah, what would that be, Jonathan?
Kaladin Shash 02:52:33 an understanding of like how, how fast the current is, how are, how far we may have traveled in the however long we've been drifting. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:52:45 You can give me some pretty insane survival checks.
Zariel Torgan 02:53:00 I got a pretty decent survival, it's plus 7. Do you want to do some math with me and talk me through it to give me advantage? We're looking at a 24.
Leopold Magnus 02:53:10 Yeah, I can carry the two.
Kaladin Shash 02:53:10 Yeah, there you go. That's cool. Then I'll just do a single roll. No, just an eight.
Dungeon Master 02:53:26 Uh, 24 is good. That's a good number. Um, you've been floating for a while. You think about it in your head from the med bay to the chapel and then the direction that the tunnel took in the chapel, you're like working it out in your head and there's the cutback. And then you realize that what you had missed before with the cutback was that it was heading almost back towards the center. So you went like up,
Dungeon Master 02:53:54 to the right, down, up, and now you're going back to the center. And you've been floating for a long time. But at this point, you're like, we're probably underneath, like the golden, like the harvesting fields. Whenever I call that one, it's been a while since I looked at the map. But, you know, you're like us south of where the amber fields.
Kaladin Shash 02:54:17 Yeah. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:54:24 If not out of the dome, it's hard to tell. You didn't get like, there was like two DCs in my head. You don't know if you are out, but you figured the direction that you had missed before is you are pretty far at this point, but you don't know if you're beyond the dome limits.
Kaladin Shash 02:54:47 Excellent. We're just floating along.
Zariel Torgan 02:54:55 Do we notice anything off? Like, supposedly, we're heading towards some sort of entity or some sort of something. Is there any sort of, like, aura or smell or sound or something that just doesn't ring true to the area that we are?
Leopold Magnus 02:54:57 Are you serious?
Dungeon Master 02:55:14 Where you are right now? No, actually it feels sort of eerie, but you don't know if it's the kind of eerie of like, I'm in an underground tunnel system moving to an unknown, unknown, unknown location anxiety. Like it doesn't feel super natural, but it is kind of present. And then, um,
Dungeon Master 02:55:38 But yeah, you don't really notice anything out of the ordinary. It's just, um, you know, just the light bouncing off the walls. Everything's pretty wet and moist, but like the tunnels moving gradual. Awesome. Um, it has been, um, we'll say like a couple hours cause Cedric had made camp
Zariel Torgan 02:55:54 All right, sweet.
Dungeon Master 02:56:09 And then did you guys long rest there or just short rest there initially? Short rest. So that was another hour. So it's like at night, and then it's been a couple. So we'll say it's like almost early morning hours, like past midnight. It's really late. You guys are still floating in the tunnel. You don't know how much longer it'll be.
Kaladin Shash 02:56:16 Short, rolling short rest. Wait, where? Yeah, short rest.
Dungeon Master 02:56:37 No, and like I'm not going to have you guys roll for just as like at this point you can't see anything but you guys can try to push through or head to a long rest or take shifts anything like that.
Zariel Torgan 02:57:00 I mean, I could take the first shift, I guess, if we're wanting to get a long rest in.
Kaladin Shash 02:57:13 I'm okay with that. That'd be good. How long do you have to rest? Are you all like, what's your down? Are you like a, like an elf where you just need to meditate? Cause my long rest, my long rest can be short.
Leopold Magnus 02:57:21 I can do the second one. Oh, actually, yeah, I have a sentry's rest. Yeah, so I don't even really have to turn myself off. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:57:46 Or you can stay in sentry mode. That's even better. That's great. You just be sentry in our tiny boat. Take a rest.
Dungeon Master 02:57:54 Mm-hmm. So sort of do it every single time, because he can see and hear. He just can't act. He's got to be rested until he wakes up. So first up will be Zariel, and then Leopold will take one for one by himself. And then it'll be Kaladin into the early morning. Everybody will get your long rest. Any chats you want to have in your solo times, or are we just going to move right along?
Kaladin Shash 02:58:25 I think I'm okay just moving right along. Unless you guys have some sort of character you want to get on.
Zariel Torgan 02:58:30 Um... Yeah, I think I'm good.
Leopold Magnus 02:58:39 Nothing from me specifically.
Dungeon Master 02:58:44 Perfect. Easy enough. You each take your rest. No issue on this night. Kaladin, you do as you were sort of falling asleep initially. Or if you're taking your whatever the elven equivalent is, I forget. But where you just take your shortened rest. You feel the warmth of the mass.
Dungeon Master 02:59:13 And you said you put it underneath your breastplate, right? Oh, but then you put it in the toolbox. Okay, so you don't feel this, okay. Then yeah, no issues. You guys all get your long rest in. In the morning, everybody give me a perception check.
Kaladin Shash 02:59:19 Right, but then we were going to put it. Yeah, I'm not. I'm not wearing it. I'm not wearing it right now. OK. Run, that's almost 19, but a lot over 23.
Kaladin Shash 02:59:51 Oh, two. Pretty darn good. Yeah, 24. Not where is it? Here it comes. 17.
Leopold Magnus 02:59:55 Not bad with an 18.
Dungeon Master 02:59:56 18 is good. No, pretty good. What did Zoe get? 14. Kaladin, you were the one who was awake as you guys entered this space, but you do notice it just kind of like you just started focusing on the brightness of like the prow, the very top of the boat.
Zariel Torgan 02:59:59 Sorry, mine's not working great. 17.
Dungeon Master 03:00:25 I just like maybe you're focusing on that and then it's actually leopold in his century rest that notices you see like a sudden flush of light at the end of this tunnel as the water sort of lets out you see.
Dungeon Master 03:00:42 truly the for the first time ever blue sky overhead and it's not the top of a dome and you see there's like shrubbery and bushes and like some landfall as you sort of hit this riverbank as you realize all sort of at the same time that you were no longer under the dome.
Kaladin Shash 03:00:49 Yeah. And we're all breathing. We're all breathing just fine. There's like no
Zariel Torgan 03:01:08 Oh, shit.
Dungeon Master 03:01:15 As far as you can tell. Yeah, Luke guy you hear like some birds in the distance.
Kaladin Shash 03:01:17 And the weather seems to be just very pleasant. Everything's just pretty. WTF, man. What is going on? Be careful.
Leopold Magnus 03:01:40 Where do you suppose we are?
Zariel Torgan 03:01:41 Well, I have a theory and you guys can tell me what you think about it. Who stands to benefit from people thinking the outside is dangerous? I would say, yes, I have a feeling that that opening of the dome was staged.
Kaladin Shash 03:02:00 with people that control the dome. It's easy. Fascinating. Oh, my goodness.
Zariel Torgan 03:02:13 to look like it's bad out there, keep people from wanting to get out. This is like summer home style, but this is nice. I mean like we could build a little cabin over here, you know, a little B&B. This is a nice setup here.
Zariel Torgan 03:02:42 Do we hear anything alive?
Dungeon Master 03:02:48 In this exact area? No, nothing at this moment other than like you can hear birds, so you know there is life. But you don't see like, you know, there's not like a deer that walks into frame and then walks out of frame.
Leopold Magnus 03:03:06 Well, Zariel, I wouldn't get too ahead of yourself. We best investigate, see if it is dangerous or not.
Kaladin Shash 03:03:12 I do remember Cedric saying that he promised great power, but I don't know who he was. He was the one that said jump in the water.
Zariel Torgan 03:03:24 Well, maybe he's talking about solar power. Can we see the dome from here? Like, the dome's giant, right? Almost an 18 plus 7.
Dungeon Master 03:03:42 Give me, yeah, give me a perception check, another set. 15. What's Leopold getting?
Kaladin Shash 03:03:42 Great.
Zariel Torgan 03:04:00 12. Jesus.
Dungeon Master 03:04:16 Knuckle 20. Is Leopold like stoked to be outside or is he just like you guys sort of make landfall on his constructed boat? He gets out and just turns and goes. Oh, the domes over there over those trees.
Leopold Magnus 03:04:18 Oh, maybe. Perceptive. Yeah, I think he kind of, he wanders way steep. He doesn't even wait to hit land. He jumps out of the boat and wades through the water and grabs a handful of sand. And as it's running through his fingers,
Zariel Torgan 03:04:32 Bye.
Kaladin Shash 03:04:32 Oh, shit. Right there.
Leopold Magnus 03:04:48 His head spins around while his body's facing one direction and goes to the group. Oh, the dome is just over that way. Spins back around, starts looking around.
Dungeon Master 03:04:57 It looks, I mean, the dome is enormous. It's big enough that they can create like fake atmosphere with like generated magic and stuff. But like you look and you can see it's like a couple miles off, but you happen to know from like basic maps drawn of the continent that the southern dome was placed in like a giant field, like a giant
Dungeon Master 03:05:24 like meadow open prairie type biome so like seeing the dome isn't unusual because it's not super mountainous through here. Natural 20. Just that it looks
Kaladin Shash 03:05:33 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 03:05:37 Is there anything else I noticed with that perception? I mean, in this area, something a little bit unique about this geography or nature.
Dungeon Master 03:05:53 undisturbed for the most part um you've never really everything inside the dome is very constructed and artificial to satisfy needs and everything and even though the amber fields are like pretty cool just because it's like lots of farmland and golden wheat and things like that like this is just like the actual outdoors but with a natural tone it's like
Dungeon Master 03:06:20 No threats near here. You're absolutely certain that you're not missing anything in this spot. You just see the direction of the dome.
Leopold Magnus 03:06:36 So I guess I'm familiar with maps of the continent. And roughly speaking, how far apart are the other domes? How far would it be to another, a different dome, like the Northern Dome? Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking.
Kaladin Shash 03:06:54 Pretty, pretty great distance.
Dungeon Master 03:07:00 Yeah, I don't think I have. A world map in this, I could add that pretty easy, actually, but. It's like it's yeah, it's an enormous distance. There was old teleportation systems between the domes, but that was sort of lost in like the big war that had happened before. So like there they it was far enough distance that they had to have teleportation.
Dungeon Master 03:07:27 But you could get there on foot if that was your goal. That is possible. Let me see if I can get that map in here. What you guys doing?
Leopold Magnus 03:07:33 Okay, I see.
Zariel Torgan 03:07:56 I guess I'm just thinking. I don't know, do we do we just kind of like. Go off and do our own thing, or do we come back and report?
Kaladin Shash 03:08:14 I think we can go back and report, but only giving half-truths. I don't know if it's a great idea if we're like, yeah, and then we jump down this rabbit hole. Tell us what you're not telling us. Yeah, and down a very rapid, tight hole.
Dungeon Master 03:08:22 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 03:08:27 How are we getting back? Because that water was only flowing one way, right? So you have to go back and then knock on the dome that has to be let in?
Kaladin Shash 03:08:45 Like I'm saying, I'm not positive. Yeah, I mean. I think I could. I could tediously get through all that. But.
Zariel Torgan 03:08:46 Yeah, let's ring the doorbell.
Leopold Magnus 03:09:07 Well, I mean, either way, if we try to conceal the fact that we exited the dome, it's going to be difficult. Unless we... Yeah, long rests. Yep.
Kaladin Shash 03:09:12 Yeah, I mean, we short-rested while we were drifting on the boat. We're committed to this. We are just here. Yeah, I remember this. I haven't seen it this big with that good detail, but that's perfect.
Zariel Torgan 03:09:22 Yeah, I think you're right. I mean... I don't know. They were... Oh shit.
Kaladin Shash 03:09:44 Right near New Harbor, Southern Dome. Any getting to any of the other ones is treacherous. We're in the planes of. Planes of fate. We've done popped out in the planes fate. So it's on. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 03:09:55 Yeah, it's either... It's just on the map for VTT.
Leopold Magnus 03:10:04 Where did it get posted? I can't find the image. Oh, I see it now. Just had my character sheet up.
Dungeon Master 03:10:09 It's on the main map. Yeah, there is.
Kaladin Shash 03:10:27 See, I see a tree of death. Is there a tree of life? Oh, there it is. There it is. I see it.
Zariel Torgan 03:10:36 That's in the bottom right. So would we have access? To a map like this, like would we know this stuff?
Dungeon Master 03:10:49 It wouldn't be this detailed. This is for like your guys's enjoyment. But like your gear, you're like Omen Knight. We haven't got the Omen Knight. You're like basically generic. Outfits had map abilities that you could bring up. And you could bring up like a basic geographical map of the entire continent. Like that was possible.
Dungeon Master 03:11:15 But if you go to do that right now you would have to basically rely on the memory of this because you realize being outside of the dome that your gifted abilities don't work through the armors the armors like inactive being outside of the dome limits.
Zariel Torgan 03:11:16 Just. Well.
Kaladin Shash 03:11:36 You mean like the healing and the voices? Yeah. Okay.
Dungeon Master 03:11:39 The healing, the communication, the runes that are special towards Leopold that give him his crossbow and his shield are present because those were custom afterwards. But like, the armor is just basic armor right now. It's not doing anything for you.
Zariel Torgan 03:11:59 Well, the good news is we're only like 360 feet away from the next dome. That's awesome. Well, what do you guys think? What do you want to do? Do you want to go to another dome? Or do you want to try to get in? What do you think?
Kaladin Shash 03:12:06 Yeah, that's just a couple. So we have this mask. We've got, I'm assuming we've got some rations.
Dungeon Master 03:12:07 Yeah, no. I couldn't make the scaling any smaller than I did.
Kaladin Shash 03:12:38 And and per our and per our lore, we only know about the North Dome, right? Being sort of with our last communications like 400 years ago or whatever. OK, that's what I thought.
Zariel Torgan 03:12:39 I've got...
Dungeon Master 03:12:47 Yeah, North Dome, Moonhaven, and New New Arbor were like those last two to have communication with each other. Because East Doctra, the West Dome, was the one where the curse first manifested. And they went to sort of like a war with Moonhaven. Moonhaven teamed up with the other two domes and sort of beat off this sort of war that was started by a bunch of monsters.
Dungeon Master 03:13:17 And then in the process, the East Dome was sort of destroyed and sort of lost communication. Nobody really knows. And then Moonhaven and New Arbor stopped talking, but that's sort of recent, so nobody super knows why. Not that you were aware of.
Zariel Torgan 03:13:18 Nice.
Kaladin Shash 03:13:26 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 03:13:37 Jonathan was there ever any settlements outside the domes? Okay.
Dungeon Master 03:13:46 But it has been over 1,000 years since they were constructed. And everybody who has been inside has only ever been inside some of the domes. So you don't know.
Leopold Magnus 03:14:07 I mean, I guess we need to just kind of take the lay of the land. It's, uh...
Kaladin Shash 03:14:12 I don't know how far we want to try to adventure, but I mean the way back doesn't feel. I mean, maybe it is. How we got here. But. Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 03:14:26 I think if we absolutely had to, we could figure out a way to get back through the way we came. It wouldn't be impossible. I could wild shape into something that swims, and we could do something like that. Or I could wild shape into something that can climb, and then one of you guys could do some sort of grappling thing, and we could walk across the ceiling. But I think the real question, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 03:14:50 I've got Spider. I've got Spiderbomb. Yeah. I think we can move forward. We just need to be kind of tactical about it. I don't... I've got one level... Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:14:57 Will give me. You don't even need to give me any sort of check you guys would know this. The northern part will not I guess northern of it but technically northwest so like top left corner of the dome.
Dungeon Master 03:15:17 is where the market district was where they used the arcane splitter to open the dome. And so you do know that there is a way back in through what is like now essentially the created entrance. You just have to get them to know that you are coming. That's true as well.
Leopold Magnus 03:15:36 You know, it might be a good idea to poke our heads over in that area anyhow and investigate the, uh, the battle.
Zariel Torgan 03:15:42 Yeah, let's see if that was even real. Yeah, let's do it. Can we do that relatively easily? Can we get over there?
Kaladin Shash 03:15:43 Sure. Sure, we can kind of let's do that. Then we can sort of always skirt around the edge of the dome while maintaining like a line of sight scouting effort. To get not get crazy far away, I like that. While walking, yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:16:05 It'll take I mean like how fast do people walk normally like a mile and 30 minutes at a casual walk. So I said it was a few miles away. It would take you like an hour ish to get to that spot roughly just walking through the fields. Cool. That's not a super long amount of time but let's go ahead and roll.
Leopold Magnus 03:16:14 Yeah, 20-minute mile.
Kaladin Shash 03:16:23 That's easy. That's fine. Great. Holy counter.
Zariel Torgan 03:16:26 Yeah, sweet. Let's do it. Yeah, let's just get going. Who's rolling that?
Dungeon Master 03:16:35 an encounter check and then depending on that we're gonna end it there and pick up next time with you guys being outside of the dome. So who wants to do the encounter check?
Kaladin Shash 03:16:51 There we go. So let's get, we'll get, now we're gonna have a very peaceful first bit and outside. Ease in. We'll ease into it.
Leopold Magnus 03:16:51 Oh boy, let's see it. Nice.
Zariel Torgan 03:16:57 Oh, yeah. Now, there's nothing out here.
Dungeon Master 03:17:06 Great role, for sure.
Dungeon Master 03:17:11 You guys are walking through. It's, you know, a beautiful day, light breeze. You smell just flowers in general and timber and you smell some moisture in the air like it recently rained and you're walking through and you're following game trails, sort of the easiest path back to the dome, which you see like the arcane from the outside is way more trippy looking. You see like striations of green energy.
Dungeon Master 03:17:38 As you can see, looking in, this beam of light travels up the center of the dome, outside of the core, hits the top of the dome, and spreads out. So you see, like, almost the arcane vein work of the magic that flows through it. And then you can see, like, enormous expanses of fields and cities and buildings, but it's sort of just opaque and a little bit blurry as you're pretty far away. But as you get closer,
Dungeon Master 03:18:06 you see you're walking into a little bit of like a little bit of like a bog type like it gets really muddy the grass gets a little mildewy and smelly and there's a little bit of like steam coming out of the ground from the heat difference and you hear some like splashing as you're moving forward.
Zariel Torgan 03:18:35 Do we want to try to stealth?
Leopold Magnus 03:18:35 Splashing not from us. Let's see, could I use a nature check to maybe assess what size of creature it is or?
Dungeon Master 03:18:38 Not from you. It's not super frequent, but it's like you hear a big whoosh of grass and snapping of the leaves and the reeds, and then you hear a pfft as the water gets splashed into.
Leopold Magnus 03:19:04 Determine anything about what it could be a 25-20
Dungeon Master 03:19:10 Yeah, go ahead and give me. You can do nature or if you just want to look at it really good, you can do perception. Natural 20. This is the quietest you've ever been. You sort of sneak low down your like unnatural arcane joints sort of in the.
Kaladin Shash 03:19:23 Let's go. Exactly what you're looking at.
Zariel Torgan 03:19:27 Jesus.
Dungeon Master 03:19:40 gears inside let you get almost into like a spider-like position super low walking through sort of the mud and eventually you get I don't have a map for this because I didn't expect it but I'll put you back here let me just add a random thing
Zariel Torgan 03:20:04 Ancient white dragon walking through a stream.
Dungeon Master 03:20:12 this but I want it to look like... I want it to look like a white image.
Leopold Magnus 03:20:39 Come on.
Dungeon Master 03:20:41 Anyway, you see a giant behemoth frog jumping back and forth in it.
Dungeon Master 03:20:47 it hasn't noticed you yet but you see it's chasing like these giant beetles they're like if standing next to you from like bottom of their foot to the top of the back of their shell would be like to your knee just like enormous and it's just like jumping into patches of the dry grass and you hear it's like big bellow as it like jumps back and forth um
Dungeon Master 03:21:13 You can relay it back to the party, but like I said, we're going to stop right there. Pick this up next time.
Kaladin Shash 03:21:22 Right, sweet man. That's pretty fun.
Leopold Magnus 03:21:24 Ice.
Zariel Torgan 03:21:27 Out of the...

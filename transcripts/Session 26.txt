Dungeon Master 00:00:00 But this is, as I described it, approximately going to take you seven good travel days to get from where you are to Moonhaven, which should be the Northern Dome. You knocked one good progress day off of that. So six days have passed. You guys are waking up, getting your long rest in. How would you like to start your day? And what's the first step for the group?
Cletus Cobbington 00:00:09 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:29 Jonathan, just to clarify, the Chiari Rung Forest roughly translated to blood forest. Blood rainforest, okay. Got it. And then I guess was there some lore around the egg and the cape? It was something about like one of the seven...
Dungeon Master 00:00:35 Yeah, like blood rainforest, if I remember right. A long time ago, I was just looking up weird languages and words for them.
Zariel Torgan 00:00:42 same.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:59 like Mad Kings or something.
Cletus Cobbington 00:00:59 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:01:02 Yeah, this is something that sort of Zareal innately understood once he attuned to it. He got like a piece of the story, like shown to his, I don't know, soul, whatever you actually attune with, his essence. And so he got like an understanding of the history of the magic that's now like attuned to his being. And that it went through and described that,
Zariel Torgan 00:01:20 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:01:32 The figure whose name had long been lost to time was originally known as the great fire spirit in the cursed war. This creature emerged due to its enormous size and innate power as one of the great generals, as you understood them to be called. You don't know who the other are. He doesn't have an understanding of that. It's not like missed information, so...
Cletus Cobbington 00:01:44 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 00:02:00 No amount of rolling or questioning is going to be like, oh, yeah, you remember suddenly who the other ones were. It's not like public knowledge who they were, but you know that this, Zaria understands this to be part of that now. And once the war had ended, this creature sort of just started roosting on the side of the large mountain, not even all the way to the top. It's a huge isolated solitary mountain. And it was part way up.
Leopold Magnus 00:02:08 Got it. And this would have been the...
Dungeon Master 00:02:30 And it just sort of weighted, sort of guarding its power until you guys eventually eliminated it and took that for yourself. And you had something you were going to say? Yes. The general public does know what the cursed war was because
Leopold Magnus 00:02:44 Cool. Oh, I was just, that was the first time we've ever heard about anything like this, right? It was like not been any, okay. Awesome.
Dungeon Master 00:03:00 Even though the domes had been pretty isolated with time when the West dome, known as Isoptera, had sort of fallen under...
Dungeon Master 00:03:10 like basically a huge curse, which was a later coined the isopric curse. The inhabitants either teleported to the other domes for safety or turned into enormous monsters and creatures and aberrations and horrors. And they were led by this figure known as the cursed king. And then that laid siege into the North Dome, which is where like... Yeah, no worries.
Dungeon Master 00:03:39 And then with that, you had general people... Sorry, hand out to get something. It should be real sneaky. There was a simultaneous assault on the North Dome and the East Dome. Eventually, the East Dome fell, and the South Dome helped the North Dome sort of persevere and defeat everything. So the war ended at Moonhaven where you're heading. And...
Zariel Torgan 00:03:51 Mm-hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 00:03:54 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:04:08 um that it's kind of like the end of general knowledge is that there was a war people rose up fought against it it was very glorious great part of history any remaining people of isoptera sort of blended into the general population um and then like that is where curse manifestation happened so like
Dungeon Master 00:04:30 Anybody in the group who has powers like you guys, you are all at least somewhat related in that your heritage all hails from the West dome. And we talked about that way back in like session one and two, but it's just been a while. So it's good to sort of reiterate that you guys have some common bloodline to some extent.
Leopold Magnus 00:04:42 Got it. So is... Yeah. I guess last question. Is there any evidence of the war in the forest? Like, obviously, that would have been pretty large. Like, is there any old, like, turned over carts? Okay. Cool.
Dungeon Master 00:05:01 Good question. You haven't seen anything yet, but that doesn't mean that there's not. You guys are still pretty South, relatively speaking, like if your little tokens are actually in relation, you're like there.
Cletus Cobbington 00:05:13 I don't think so. I think so.
Dungeon Master 00:05:33 Any other clarifying questions? Okay. You guys have your mornings to pack up your gear and get ready. After eight hours, Cletus, you feel a calling from your staff. It sort of just innately wants you to pull it out because...
Zariel Torgan 00:05:41 Yeah, I'm good.
Dungeon Master 00:06:00 Tiny Hut only lasts for eight hours, so you'll have to like, it'll lose its ability eventually, but it's calling to you to sort of retract it from the ground. All righty.
Cletus Cobbington 00:06:03 Sure. I was going to say, I just pry it from the ground and stamp it back down and the willow tree dissipates. Oh, yeah. That was a long, it's long rest, right? How do I get to do that?
Cyrus Schwert 00:06:10 Good.
Zariel Torgan 00:06:27 Yeah. And we're level 10. I just was hoping you wouldn't notice. Yeah, that was rough for him. At the very least, he should be level 10.
Kaladen Shash 00:06:35 you know
Dungeon Master 00:06:37 Do you think you jumped two levels? You guys are getting your shit rock. If you guys have a good encounter today, you'll guys level up again, because this is about session three of where you currently have been at.
Cletus Cobbington 00:06:42 Hey, that T-Rex and that big bird almost killed me, so. Big creatures are not my friend for some reason.
Cyrus Schwert 00:06:42 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:07:04 So I guess in the back of your head, think about what you do want to level up.
Leopold Magnus 00:07:10 Yes, I think you deserve it, Cletus. You almost got sucked by that giant squid, too. Well, maybe you're just a blood bag.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:12 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Cletus Cobbington 00:07:14 No. I being sucked, bit, and burned. I don't know what's happening. Well, I guess the one blessing was the holy roasted almonds. Oh, speaking of. We did take a wonderful...
Cyrus Schwert 00:07:20 Absolutely almost got stuck. In a different context, it wouldn't have been so bad. Just so constant.
Dungeon Master 00:07:40 Amen. Should tell them what it does, too.
Cletus Cobbington 00:07:44 long rest so uh i'm a hand cyrus a big juicy plump roasted almond care to bond with me today youngin
Zariel Torgan 00:07:53 plump.
Cyrus Schwert 00:07:53 Wait, what? It might. Okay. I think I remember. Turn something into a crit, right?
Leopold Magnus 00:07:57 Don't be scared. And I really give him an elbow.
Kaladen Shash 00:07:58 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 00:08:11 Yeah, when you're bonded, whenever I get healed, you share the same healing, and I'm able to invoke it once per rest turns, yeah, turns the attack into a crew. Since you're nasty with that sword might come in handy, be even nastier. Don't worry about it.
Dungeon Master 00:08:20 Yeah. Just been sitting in his mouth.
Cyrus Schwert 00:08:24 It's crazy. Yeah. Why is it wet? The almond's like really wet. That's why it's warm too, huh? That's great. That sucks. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:08:37 You see Chip just like a little bit of drool coming out of his mouth. It was definitely in his mouth. Well, that's both from the roasting, but also potentially his mouth, yes. Yeah, you can hold it in your pocket, but...
Cyrus Schwert 00:08:56 Do I have to eat it? Out of character. So I'm going to have to eat this. I might as well do it when it's warm, I guess.
Dungeon Master 00:09:01 When you use it for a crit, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:09:04 Or you could get the spit off of it first.
Leopold Magnus 00:09:04 You have to eat it.
Cletus Cobbington 00:09:07 When I force you to invoke it, it kind of forces you to eat it. We'll just wipe it off. It'll be fine. It doesn't. Oh, God.
Kaladen Shash 00:09:07 Got it. That's right.
Cyrus Schwert 00:09:21 He doesn't. Darius does not. He eats it like way too slowly. Like a kid at the table who doesn't want to eat his broccoli, but he has to. And then it's just cold by the end and like way worse than if he just did it. Yeah. This is the damp almond. It's al dente.
Zariel Torgan 00:09:34 it's just a limp almond
Leopold Magnus 00:09:37 You're really savoring that! I'm just glad I didn't have to eat that! I just threw it in here!
Cletus Cobbington 00:09:37 Like, it was just wet. Now it's just soggy. God. All right. Noted, next time, I will make sure it does not come from Chip's mouth.
Dungeon Master 00:09:45 He looks so gross. He looks really upset that he doesn't get to stuck on it anymore. Just fills his cheek.
Cyrus Schwert 00:09:55 Perfect. You didn't eat it? Are you serious?
Cletus Cobbington 00:10:03 I give him a non-bonding one, I guess. We're bonded anyway, so what's it to you, buddy? All right.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:07 So, Zaryl, do you have your dogs out? You've been training them? All right, yeah. I was going to ask, I was like, Zadriel, are you ever going to name those little pups over there?
Zariel Torgan 00:10:18 I did, um, before the, we took the long wrist, I think. That was one of the one things that I did before we betted down. Well, um, I mean, I probably would have to have named them for training, right? Is that a thing? Uh,
Cletus Cobbington 00:10:37 Perp one, club two.
Dungeon Master 00:10:43 That's your call. He had a less than good training session last time.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:45 Let me think about it. I'll answer this in character later as if it was in real time and I'll put some thought into what I actually want to name them rather than. Yeah, it was pretty meh. But I'll come up with the name. I'll think about it for a second. Maybe I'll write down some options.
Kaladen Shash 00:10:52 It's okay. It's okay. Two is two. That's what I was remembering.
Cyrus Schwert 00:10:52 How many are there? How many are there? Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:52 That's right.
Cletus Cobbington 00:11:06 kind of time, the kind of check on the purpose.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:14 I thought there was three, but I think there's just two. So I'll name them. Oh, go ahead.
Dungeon Master 00:11:19 No. You killed two and stole two. Again, I just... I just really need to reiterate this. You guys only got them because you rolled a natural point. They were not going to go with you. They were not going to be part of the story.
Cyrus Schwert 00:11:23 Oh.
Kaladen Shash 00:11:25 Is their behavior still? Yeah. Like I say, is their behavior still like pretty, like really friendly towards us or they, do we notice any behavior change? 20, okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:11:45 Oh.
Cletus Cobbington 00:11:49 Ha ha ha ha.
Dungeon Master 00:11:49 You only have them because of one critical success. So they do not love you. They do not treat you as if they like you. Zario, it's like a tense training session each time he can get them to obey him because there's like cursed blood running through him. The party, a lot of the party doesn't know that yet. But...
Dungeon Master 00:12:10 There is a shared bond, but it's very tense because essentially they have a known, established leader role in their life, and he's kind of trying to replace that figure, and it has not been a lot of time yet. So it's been so far.
Kaladen Shash 00:12:21 All right. Right in front of.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:26 It's going. Yeah, it's going really well. It's not like blackfish at all. Yeah. Yeah. I like that's three names for two of them.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:26 Yeah, we stripped killed the mom right in front of them.
Cyrus Schwert 00:12:31 Like Handmaid's Tale. Have you seen that on Hulu? Crazy. What about Cracker and Cookie?
Cletus Cobbington 00:12:41 I got some names, actually. How about Nick, crack, and scratch? It kind of goes of chip, you know what I'm saying? Be little pals. No, I said Nick, crack, and scratch. Nick, like it's Nick. No, those are three names. Each dog. There's only two?
Dungeon Master 00:12:49 There's only two. Three names.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:56 Crackard.
Kaladen Shash 00:12:59 Crack and scratch. You crack and scratch. There's only two of them.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:00 Is Nick the first name and crack the last name? There's two. Hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 00:13:07 There's only two. Fuck Nick, dude. It's a bad name.
Cletus Cobbington 00:13:11 Oh, then take the best ones. Yeah, crack and scratch. What's wrong with some options, all right? Well, Nick as a nick in it, not Nick as a nickel is all right. All right. I give up. I was going to offer to help. I'm druidic as well, but whatever. I throw my hands across. I'm pissed.
Dungeon Master 00:13:31 He crosses his arms.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:32 Yeah. Yeah, I'm still. Yeah, I'm still thinking about it. I want to wait until they...
Cletus Cobbington 00:13:39 I just start fiddling with Chip. Don't respect my names.
Cyrus Schwert 00:13:46 He didn't like it.
Leopold Magnus 00:13:49 uh oh yeah like on the tigris river the wolf pups from rome yeah that's great oh well azareel if you ever did anything made up i might be able to help you out with those pups just uh shoot me the idea and i can build something for you
Kaladen Shash 00:13:55 Romulus. Yeah. Just name him Romulus and Remus. It'll go perfect. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a good pair.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:05 Nice. Yeah, I might need like one of those self-feeder things. If I ever forget to go down there, it kind of goes off on a timer. You know?
Dungeon Master 00:14:08 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:14:24 Yeah Pretty good.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:26 Okay, yeah, I think I could put something together. I think I could work something up for that. I think I could work something up for that?
Zariel Torgan 00:14:29 Yeah, maybe it like plays a little clip of me being like, hey, cuties, come get food. And then, you know, something nice for him. To get the air in. Yeah. It's like a straw that pokes out. It's like a straw that pokes out.
Dungeon Master 00:14:37 Yeah. From a meta perspective, it's also very funny in that like every 10 minutes or less, Zario has to put down the workshop, open the lid, and exchange the air. Not to change that. That's just, that's physics. Yeah, air gets cut out.
Kaladen Shash 00:14:48 Yeah, open the list. Yes. A snorkel? No, it's a dimension. It's just, and it can't travel open. We know the rules. We know the rules.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:06 Yeah. All right. Well, Zaria, I can make you something. I'm going to use one of my arcane, like, tinkerer deals. It's just like, I think I get, like, so many that I can fill up. What's it called? Yeah, magical tinkering. And I just get, like, six a day that I can. Yep. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:07 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:15:09 You just need a home. Yeah. You have a certain number you can maintain at a time. So it's not six per day indefinitely. You can just go like 6, 12, 18, but like you have six and you can change them out as you see fit.
Cletus Cobbington 00:15:14 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:37 Yeah. So I'm going to make one. I'm going to imbue it with a recorded message, because I can do that. And then I can have it emit an odor of pleasant steak. And then let's see. Yeah. So then I'll kind of work up a little hopper feeder with a clock that I have.
Dungeon Master 00:15:47 Yes, you can. What? Love it.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:53 Mm-hmm.
Kaladen Shash 00:15:53 Oh, ho!
Leopold Magnus 00:16:03 maybe being carried around for the spare parts and wire it so that way all that goes off on the hour. So I hand it over to Zaire and I say, just put the food in there. And I point to the hopper.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:17 All right. I'll do it. It's just the wettest, just like animal viscera food because we don't have pellet dog food. Oh. Nice.
Kaladen Shash 00:16:24 That's exactly what I was waiting for.
Dungeon Master 00:16:25 Yeah, but I'll say that's really ingenuitive. I'm going to give, that'll be like the assist style that I'm doing where you are adding two to whatever animal handling check that he makes next.
Leopold Magnus 00:16:38 Nice. What message are you going to record into it? I kind of hold it up and waiting for you to speak into it.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:47 I was like, oh, now, yeah, uh, here, here puppies, come get your food, it's Papa. And then I'll go like a, like a really roboty kind of whistle, like a foo, trying to whistle on over. And then, uh, that'll be at an end. Is that how it ends?
Kaladen Shash 00:16:56 Train whistle, a train whistle.
Dungeon Master 00:17:02 A train level? Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:14 Yeah, and then I hit the button and you just hear the recording bag. It says, yeah, come get your food. And then you kind of hear this chitter chatter back and forth. And then you say, oh, is that how it ends? And then you actually hear it cut off. And all these lights start flashing and this just like kind of putrid smell of like whatever the slop you've been feeding them sprays out of it. And some bells go off.
Cyrus Schwert 00:17:23 Jesus.
Cletus Cobbington 00:17:28 Remember when I said you need to really clean down there. Remember when I said you need to really clean down there? This is not helped the issue.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:29 Perfect. The dogs. How do they, do they like it?
Kaladen Shash 00:17:35 No. No.
Dungeon Master 00:17:47 Yeah, I will, we'll find out. Okay, good use of the morning. As you guys set off for your day, um,
Leopold Magnus 00:17:55 There's just dog shit everywhere. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:17:57 Dog shit and rotten meat everywhere. People's the next invention.
Cyrus Schwert 00:17:58 You didn't even like put down a puppy pad.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:02 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:18:13 one person go ahead and give me an encounter check a d20 um and then based on that we'll do no sorry somebody give me a survival check and then we'll do the encounter check i don't care who
Kaladen Shash 00:18:29 was good at that. You liked it. You liked it.
Cletus Cobbington 00:18:30 Well, Caledale almost killed me with some T-Rexes last time. Did in fact not enjoy. Are he just doing it? I think you got plus one above me. I got a plus seven.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:32 I got a plus eight. I can't. I can, but I think you have the same as me, Cletus. All right, we'll see what we got. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Cyrus Schwert 00:18:37 Yeah, go ahead. I think. Me too. Oh. This is exactly the same thing that happened last time.
Dungeon Master 00:18:59 a little while. Natural one. Um...
Cletus Cobbington 00:19:01 Again. Can I roll the turn around and go back to the village. I think I want to live an honest life with them.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:02 This is pretty amazing. The last one.
Kaladen Shash 00:19:03 What was clear? What is this? This forest, they said, he warned us, they said danger.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:08 Jesus Christ. Jonathan, did you have anything ready for that?
Cyrus Schwert 00:19:09 We're going to fight Knowles again? Once only we're fighting the Knowles again.
Dungeon Master 00:19:18 Yeah, actually, to that point, that's a great segue. You guys are walking for a few hours. The sun is hitting from like the early hours of being just above the horizon, almost midday shining through the trees. No perception check required. As soon as you sort of leave the more dense trees and it starts to open up, you see a large mountain tree.
Dungeon Master 00:19:45 to your sort of north and west. And eventually you do see like evidence of a waterway sort of heading in front of you. And then you realize you're going the wrong way. You got mixed up at some point and you were exiting the south of the forest heading towards what would be Cottonwood. You lose a day of travel.
Cyrus Schwert 00:20:06 We made really good time. You're already. I thought the forest is going to be like way longer. Yes.
Zariel Torgan 00:20:09 Yeah, we were heading back, right? Yeah, we're here.
Leopold Magnus 00:20:09 We just walked in a circle.
Kaladen Shash 00:20:18 Back to the village, all right.
Dungeon Master 00:20:18 But no encounter check required on that one because didn't get far enough to do anything. So go ahead and give me the next survival check. We're not going to do repeat. So once we circle through, somebody will get to do it again. But everybody's going to participate. 15.
Cletus Cobbington 00:20:24 15.
Zariel Torgan 00:20:40 Nice.
Cyrus Schwert 00:20:41 Take it.
Dungeon Master 00:20:45 A little more haste, you guys are getting somewhat tired, no exhaustion or anything, but you turn around sort of on your heels, head directly into the force, which you deem to be the straightest path. And almost half the time you make it to the carcasses of the T-Rex and the velociraptors you.
Dungeon Master 00:21:03 sort of hit where you were before and you keep advancing. And the trees get more dense and more dense and the light gets a little bit more scattered. And so the foliage goes from being...
Zariel Torgan 00:21:09 All.
Dungeon Master 00:21:17 tall, thick, and heavy to all of the foliage is growing up the trees to get towards the sunlight or that's crawling on the ground to hit any sort of scattering of sunlight. And even though this is called the Kiari Rum Forest, you very quickly realize there's a gradual transition into like a dense rainforest jungle.
Dungeon Master 00:21:37 Everything is getting moist and wet and it's very humid and there's like a low level of fog sort of sitting at the base of your feet as you're walking through. The forest transitions a little bit more murkier and boggier. Your footsteps are met with mud and there's always a suction sound as you sort of march in line through the forest. Somebody give me an encounter checkdown. Just a D20A1.
Cletus Cobbington 00:21:39 Hmm?
Zariel Torgan 00:22:05 Nami. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:22:05 I pushed my way to the front to not be smelling the humid dog shit and almond milk that when it's so hot and fucking rank. I'm like, excuse me, like bumping into everybody. I will not be in the back. Sorry, it's just like rank out here. Did somebody run and roll?
Kaladen Shash 00:22:12 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:22:20 Oh, oh, oh, oh, excuse me. Oh, 1. Oh, 1. Yeah. 13. Above average.
Cletus Cobbington 00:22:27 All right, roll it. Roll your encounter then. That's you. You push your way to the front. Hey, weapon number.
Dungeon Master 00:22:28 But is it Riz? D20. Rola 1. 13. 13. Yes, it is.
Cyrus Schwert 00:22:35 Oh shit.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:45 Oh, that's not bad.
Kaladen Shash 00:22:50 Yeah, sorry.
Dungeon Master 00:22:54 You guys are a few hours into the right direction at this point. The terrain is wet and boggy. And very similar to the old remnants of that sort of ruin, that temple that you had delved into with the mind flares and all of the abyssal creatures that you had fought, you start to see some very long, forgotten...
Dungeon Master 00:23:20 unmaintained architecture, worked stone, but it's very sunk into the ground and almost completely covered with like crawling ivies and stuff like that. But eventually you see like three-quarters submerged into the mud, but not entirely this. What I will describe to you guys is like dwarven style. It's hard geometric lines, almost it's like a statue, but it looks more
Cletus Cobbington 00:23:27 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:23:49 Egyptian sphinx-like with just like the way it's designed and its presentation, but it's a statue with the exception of the two eye sockets in the center are hollow. They're like set back in it, but otherwise just looks like stone. Just in the forest.
Cletus Cobbington 00:24:11 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:24:15 It's just in the forest. It's pretty overgrown. Is there any evidence of a path through here? Do we just kind of stumble into it?
Dungeon Master 00:24:23 Yep.
Dungeon Master 00:24:31 You guys been following general game trails, so it's pretty narrow. There's not a lot of animals that just innately walk in wide groups. So you're on a pretty thin path that disappears at some points, and then you pick up another game trail at other points as you pass like water spots or like salt deposits, like areas where animals would congregate. But there's not like...
Dungeon Master 00:24:56 worked stone in the ground laying out a path. That's probably long since disappeared or been covered by mud. Um, not necessarily. Looks different. Different region.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:06 Does the style of this look reminiscent to anything we've seen before? Okay. Gotcha. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 00:25:07 Can we see any foot? Can we see any footprints in the mud?
Cletus Cobbington 00:25:20 I'll cast detect magic.
Dungeon Master 00:25:25 No footprints. With detect magic, you detect...
Dungeon Master 00:25:32 The school of magic is technically necromancy, but it's more of like a, it's not a dark version. It's more of just like the enchantment of imbueing things with a source of energy. So like similar to like an animate spell would be equivalent kind of deal. It's somewhat abjuration, a little necromancy, a little bit enchantment based. But not a huge aura. So this is nothing like not a trap necessarily.
Leopold Magnus 00:25:44 Well, what do you all make? Well, what do you all make of it?
Cletus Cobbington 00:25:51 Gotcha. Okay. Well, that's interesting. It kind of looks neat. I kind of want to poke it.
Kaladen Shash 00:26:16 Thanks.
Cletus Cobbington 00:26:22 I don't want to poke it. But it's real hard for me not to just start poking stuff. What can I say? Let's see. Let's see.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:24 Uh.
Leopold Magnus 00:26:26 Oh, well, remember last time you poked your squirrel under the staff? I feel like maybe some more of that would happen. I'll tread carefully.
Cyrus Schwert 00:26:26 It's just like a building.
Cletus Cobbington 00:26:57 Could I do like a nature check to see if there's any like animals around?
Kaladen Shash 00:26:59 Do we see any? Yeah. Do we see any other evidence of like, you know, like ruins or buildings like a foundation or like what would be like a lump or it's just like the only thing we see out here?
Dungeon Master 00:27:06 Yeah, I gave me just a general nature check. Pretty good check. Give me a perception check. While you're looking around, Pleitas, you're sort of listening, you hear some just like,
Dungeon Master 00:27:31 Not animal folk equivalent, but just like there are a lot of birds in the trees, some various like rodents skittering around like your ears are doing that cow twitch thing as you're picking up the different sounds. There are plenty of animals. If you're looking for a specific one, 211 is pretty good. And then...
Cletus Cobbington 00:27:44 I just want to, I want to pull out an almond and, like, say, like, try and call a squirrel or a rat or something, chipmunk, perhaps. I'm like...
Dungeon Master 00:27:59 You're like holding out your hand with an almond on it and you're like doing a squirrel squeak trying to call one in. And you have trouble at first because Chip keeps like going down your body, getting in front of you and trying to take it in front, like holds out his hands and then you push him to the side and he comes around and does it again. And eventually you're like holding him back and he's fighting me and you see this one like timid squirrel sort of like running up, stopping, running up, stopping, sort of pretending to eat some seeds in the ground and gets a little bit closer.
Cletus Cobbington 00:28:13 Wrong squirrel trip.
Kaladen Shash 00:28:13 Mm.
Dungeon Master 00:28:29 And while you do that, Caldon with a 12, you see there's like another workstone thing, you know, 20 or so yards up the trail a bit, but you're not certain if you're hitting everything, but you don't see any other workstone, no buildings, no paths. After a thorough investigation, it just seems like one more thing up the path. Cletus, are you trying to talk to this creature? Because I know you can do that.
Kaladen Shash 00:28:47 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:28:51 yes um which i have i'm able to do that i got speech of the woods i can decipher their talks or their noises as well um i want to give him a little the little almond and say hey youngin uh anything or do these statues do anything notice anything weird around here
Dungeon Master 00:29:03 Young. Who you call it Young? He's the second. He was, I'm 45.
Cletus Cobbington 00:29:23 My bad. Wow. Well, sir, anything weird with these stacking? I give him two more almonds. My apologies.
Kaladen Shash 00:29:29 Oh.
Cyrus Schwert 00:29:32 That's an old squirrel. Oh, do you guys smell that? What is that?
Dungeon Master 00:29:32 You know how many seasons I've lived through? Hold on a cigarette. Not here. That right there is my piss rock, and that one over there is my shit rock. But they've been around longer than I have.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:54 Oh, dropping, Cyrus, it appears.
Cletus Cobbington 00:29:54 So you're telling me when you piss and shit on these rocks, nothing happens, even if you pitter-patter. Hmm, I see. Well, have fun with that. Thank you, good sir.
Dungeon Master 00:30:03 Nope. And he goes, but you've been real generous, so I'll let you in on this. These two nuts you've given me, I'll put them in my stash, and my stash is in that one's eyeball. And you have a blessed day.
Cletus Cobbington 00:30:24 All right, I've learned from these elder squirrels. These statues mean nothing. I am thoroughly convinced. Careful, there's a lot of squirrels.
Cyrus Schwert 00:30:30 Do we see that scroll put the thing in his eye?
Kaladen Shash 00:30:32 Is it?
Leopold Magnus 00:30:35 Jonathan, so the one that's kind of works stone further down, can I take a look at that? Maybe do a little light digging around the area, try to excavate, see if there's any kind of structures below ground.
Dungeon Master 00:30:50 pretty one thing at a time who was first yeah you see he runs up and he climbs up like the worked face and he like it's again like an inlet sort of like you'd think a circle on the inside of the orbital um just seems hollow at first glance but he just sort of stuffs his nuts in there and you see that he's got like
Cyrus Schwert 00:30:58 Does, do we see the squirrel put that thing in the eyeball? Like, does he do it right now?
Dungeon Master 00:31:18 different seeds and stuff that he uses a store um and then leopold as you're digging out the one further down sort of near calidon um it's very boggy very muddy so as you sort of dig things out it does sort of refill as the water seeps back in and carries the soil up but you can tell with like the digging you're doing as you're looking at it it's the same
Dungeon Master 00:31:44 figure same style maybe slight differences but it seems to be like laid flat like it sort of fell into position and sort of sunk down so instead of being mostly ahead it is like a very long not super tall stone form would look like a rock if you didn't know that it probably had a head below it
Cyrus Schwert 00:31:49 Thanks.
Leopold Magnus 00:32:04 Would they, if it looked like it was upright, would it be gazing towards the other statue? Or would they be both looking in the same direction? Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:32:13 No, they look like they're looking the same direction. The one closer to you, I guess it's like you're looking straight down the path that's like more to your left. Like it is twisted a bit, but you don't know if that's just general sinking with time or like that. There's no real way to discern. They're definitely not facing each other though.
Leopold Magnus 00:32:35 So I guess is there anything that looks obvious as I kind of gaze where they're looking? There's nothing out there that they're watching. As far as I can tell. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:32:35 Well, that squirrels got it's got it's stuff full with nuts.
Dungeon Master 00:32:44 Nope. I don't know. A foot by a foot. It's a pretty large statue.
Kaladen Shash 00:32:48 And how deep are these sort of carved out eyes? Like there's nothing in them. Okay. How deep?
Cyrus Schwert 00:32:49 Well. Are all four eyes, or the two that we can see, part about? Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:33:09 Yeah. It's really stuffing his nuts inside that skull. Well, maybe if we have two seconds, you want to help me upright this one.
Dungeon Master 00:33:12 Both eyes, but the other one is face down so you can't see any, like, the eyes or anything.
Cyrus Schwert 00:33:24 I feel like this is just a squirrel's, like, house, and we could just, like, keep walking. You... There's, like, shit all over it. Yeah, let's try to lift it. It's huge.
Kaladen Shash 00:33:31 Yes, I agree. This looks like very large. We need to spend, we should waste more time right here.
Cletus Cobbington 00:33:37 What do we not understand? The squirrel told me that's a shit stone, okay? I have tried to walk. Yeah. We already went back towards the damn village. And I got half eaten by a fucking T-Rex. I ain't got time for shitstones. All right.
Leopold Magnus 00:33:46 Okay. Okay, then.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:49 Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yeah, we'll keep going.
Cyrus Schwert 00:34:00 That was not my fault. Let's just keep walking, huh?
Kaladen Shash 00:34:01 Yes. Yes. Yes. Let us move forward. Please, we will.
Cletus Cobbington 00:34:12 I would love to keep walking.
Dungeon Master 00:34:13 okay you guys go um a couple more hours um trying to head in the same way as you guys are sort of going who's leading the next sort of segment it is hitting the mid to late afternoon at this point um
Dungeon Master 00:34:34 It continues to get bog gear until you do find like high spots, dry spots, but there are a lot more like just in forest waterbeds, small cricks, pools just like surrounding you. The air smells a lot like fungus and constantly decomposing things. Like the waft very much hits your nose. There's a lot more insect presence.
Zariel Torgan 00:34:43 Not me.
Cyrus Schwert 00:34:56 I only have a plus one. I only have a plus one. I'm not super in tune with the forest.
Dungeon Master 00:34:57 loud chirping of like cicadas and crickets. Like it's very soundful at all times. But who's leading this next part? Yeah, the one sends you out of the forest and one sent you pretty good forward.
Leopold Magnus 00:35:09 Thanks.
Kaladen Shash 00:35:11 There's been two roles for survival already. Okay. Well, yeah. I have plus two. I'll fill you the way. I found the path. It's right here.
Cletus Cobbington 00:35:14 Mm-hmm. Cletus and Zari. Who's next? I swear to God there's another T-Rex. Wow.
Cyrus Schwert 00:35:26 I'm a city kid. It's all about the first number. Oh. Wait, look, there's a road.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:30 To be two to your exes. Damn. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. It's a zip line.
Kaladen Shash 00:35:40 There it is. There's the path. It's this way.
Cletus Cobbington 00:35:43 A path straight to a T-Rex. Straight to his open mouth.
Dungeon Master 00:35:44 Nice. It's a direct path. Um, you see, um, it's,
Cyrus Schwert 00:35:57 See it.
Dungeon Master 00:35:59 Like, I'll go back to the big map to explain it a little bit better as you hit there. You know from general world maps that at one point, the forest kind of comes in a little bit, gets thinner and then widens back out, where it gets pretty dense. And you know that you've been relatively to the east side of the forest. And eventually...
Dungeon Master 00:36:22 The forest breaks up enough that you get like a sight line of the horizon. It's not just all trees. There's enough of a break. And then as you're doing it, go ahead and everybody give me a perception check. Is that a natural 20?
Kaladen Shash 00:36:29 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:36:47 22. Damn.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:48 Natural 20. Makes up for my back-to-back ones for survival checks, hopefully.
Leopold Magnus 00:36:50 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:37:02 10, 9, 28, 22, and 18. Pretty good average across the board. Anybody who got over a 15, you'll see the pretty obvious thing. And then the natural 20 will be something that just Zario sees. But as everybody's looking forward, you see that your sight line is pretty far, actually. And beyond that,
Zariel Torgan 00:37:28 Yes.
Dungeon Master 00:37:29 There must be just like a pretty gradual decline to the terrain ahead of you. You see that you're at like the perfect location and that there's, you know, following sort of the north coastline of the whole continent, there's what's called the Northern Crown Cascades. And you seem to be seeing a gap in it. There's just like not as many mountains. And you can swear larger than any of the mountains, an enormous tree, just way off in the distance.
Dungeon Master 00:38:00 So far north, it is towering over the mountains, but just you're at the right spot at the right time. You look north and you see this huge thing way out there, past the plains, past the water, past the mountains, sort of unlike the north end of the continent. Zaryl, as everybody's sort of admiring this tree ahead of you, you see that.
Dungeon Master 00:38:25 And then there's just something about the way you're positioned and the sensitivity or the sensors in your automaton body. You feel this gentle rumble below your feet, something that probably would have been much more aggressive, have you been farther south. And you turn very quickly and you end this area where you do have this gap. You see just the very peak of Drake's roost sort of behind you, mostly covered by trees. You hear, again, just ever so faintless rumble.
Dungeon Master 00:38:56 You see some smoke plume at the top. Looks like a little bit of the mountain crumbles, something that would be way more devastating if you were much closer. And you swear, you swear you see something eject straight out of the mountain into the sky before disappearing. And that's all you see.
Kaladen Shash 00:39:16 And what?
Dungeon Master 00:39:16 before you can even direct everybody's attention to it. They see the sort of smoke rising out and they maybe see like settling of snow and stuff from the top of the mountain, but they don't see any of the other stuff that you see. Is that Razzle or Arlo? Hi, Arlo.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:31 Mm, all right. Well, I'll explain.
Cyrus Schwert 00:39:32 He's something. It's something. It's cute. That's a big tree.
Leopold Magnus 00:39:37 This one's Arlo. He's more interested in what's going on outside. Yeah, oh yeah, definitely. That's what's always on his mind.
Dungeon Master 00:39:48 He's thinking about how many deer he could chase right now. Then somebody give me an encounter check while you do all this stuff. You, with everything we've talked about recently, give me a history check with advantage.
Cletus Cobbington 00:39:58 Wow. Wow.
Cyrus Schwert 00:40:04 Do we do we know about this tree? Like, is this like a thing? It's like culturally.
Leopold Magnus 00:40:21 And then you said over a 15 to see any of this? I'm just kind of walking around. What are you guys going on about? Tree, where?
Dungeon Master 00:40:25 Yeah, so everybody's, oh, I guess you are under that. Mostly focus on the fact that you're so heavy, you're sinking. 17. Cyrus, you've heard tale and read about it in all the stories used to get up, caught up with, and...
Zariel Torgan 00:40:25 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Dungeon Master 00:40:48 talking with all your friends back in the day about how when you were adventurers and you were outside of the dome, you'd follow in the path of everybody else that you had read about. You think, based off of the general location that you're looking, what you kind of see, you see the mountains ahead of it. It makes sense that this is what is like called the tree of death. There are two what are known as celestial trees on this continent.
Dungeon Master 00:41:15 the tree of death and the tree of life, and you know the tree of death is in the north. Large, large ash, actually, is what it is. It is an ash tree.
Cyrus Schwert 00:41:18 Hmm. You tell it's an asking, by the way, it is. Okay. Okay. I think I keep that to myself.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:20 So is this like a birch or what are we looking at? Hmm. Well, I would relay the extra stuff that I saw
Kaladen Shash 00:41:34 Ash, Treen, is that what you said?
Leopold Magnus 00:41:37 Yeah, Astrid, I think.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:50 with the mountain and the thing shooting out of it and just let everyone know what I saw that way everybody is up to date.
Cyrus Schwert 00:42:04 Did somebody roll an encounter check already? Where are we going to? Is it just your hand over?
Cletus Cobbington 00:42:06 I think so. I think Leopold's up. You're the only one? No. Six T-Rexes.
Dungeon Master 00:42:06 Nobody's done one yet. This one's random, so there's one better one. Yeah. Oh, this is not a good one. Sorry.
Leopold Magnus 00:42:09 Who's doing it? All right. Oh, gee. So, letting them roll.
Kaladen Shash 00:42:18 That's what we say. That's not so bad. That's just soft. That's soft encounter. Yeah. Oh, they're randomized. That's even better. That's even better.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:22 Nah. It's just... Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's what you want to hear.
Cyrus Schwert 00:42:34 Don't you know how to say that? We could figure it out.
Dungeon Master 00:42:36 It's a pre-mate list. No, it's not like horrible. It's just like kind of inconvenient. You guys have been making really good progress all day. And in this sort of break in the trees, you hear just a loud, just a loud rumble as you see probably from the huge geological event that happened to the South.
Dungeon Master 00:42:59 there's like disruption in the atmosphere. You see this huge cloud thing sort of rolling in, lightning striking. The energy in the air feels very charged. You can tell that you're about to get fucking pissed on with rain. And sure enough, it just starts raining, torrential downpour. You guys, you sort of almost sprint into the tree line to see if you can get some sort of break and it's,
Zariel Torgan 00:43:14 Hmm. Oh, Jesus Christ.
Dungeon Master 00:43:25 Somewhat beneficial, but eventually the trees get so soaked. They're just dripping constantly and there's just, it is just raining in the jungle itself as well. You guys lose a day of travel. You now have eight days left to, you know, something happened. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:43:41 Of course, of course.
Leopold Magnus 00:43:46 So Jonathan, that volcano, there was a volcanic event that exploded. Did it send like just smoke or was it magma that we saw?
Zariel Torgan 00:43:47 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:43:54 Yeah, there is a huge plume of smoke. Zoriel saw like a brief explosion of fire, but nothing sustained. The volcano doesn't seem like it is still erupting, which to anybody who knows about volcanoes, that is an odd thing. There is not just like a 10-second explosion.
Cletus Cobbington 00:44:11 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:44:18 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:44:18 So, you know, do with that information what you will, ask questions that you would like to. But yeah, you guys just sort of spend the rest of your day trying to stay dry, sort of. It has become a full on slough through the jungle, hard to find dry areas. You have to take frequent break. And I'll say you sort of just like lose the rest of your day. You make camp.
Dungeon Master 00:44:44 And unless you guys want to do anything very specific, you'll start your next day with seven days left to travel. Yes. You were at six. You backtracked back to Cottonwood to seven and then you just lost the day at the end of that day. So it was eight. So you were back to seven.
Cyrus Schwert 00:44:55 Seven.
Leopold Magnus 00:44:57 Because we lost a day. That's nice.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:03 Yeah. Eat.
Dungeon Master 00:45:08 But the good thing is, is when you roll the encounter, I delete it, and I'll just pick the closest number above or below. So you won't lose that day again. And you already lost the going back to Cottonwood Survival Check. So you guys, you can't do it again. There are other things in there, sure, but you guys...
Cletus Cobbington 00:45:12 In my bones I can feel another T-Rex coming.
Cyrus Schwert 00:45:26 Right. Oh, dear. This is not going well. I guess that's why they call some dears.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:31 Mm-hmm.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:38 So. Can I have spent time through the evening again, like a pretty civil life to do the four hours of meditation on trying to enchant the ring again without it going poorly?
Dungeon Master 00:45:41 But so, yeah, I leave it up to you guys. Do anything to end your night, but in the morning, what would you guys like to do? Yeah. What is your total hours on it right now?
Kaladen Shash 00:46:07 Um, halfway because that last effort was a wash because of that backfire. So I think you said it was going to be 16 hours total or 32 total. I'm at 16. Something like that or no. Yeah, because I wanted to do like another like six or seven hours and I got nothing out of it. Yep. Is this?
Dungeon Master 00:46:13 32 total, yes. You're at 16. Go ahead and give me... Okay. Yeah, it totally backfired. Give me another DC-14. I think it's just Arcana check.
Cletus Cobbington 00:46:21 Okay. Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:46:46 That's horrible. I can't do it. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:46:49 uh 10 is not a mishap though that is just you spend you don't spend the whole night so you're not going to waste all your time and you won't waste the resources into the enchanting process but you're sort of going back into it and you realize that you had messed up that one enchanting runes so bad that you have to kind of buff out a lot of it and go back like like coding like
Dungeon Master 00:47:12 You have to go back 10 lines and figure out where your error was. And so you're running through, reworking the enchantments, seeing what works up to a certain point. So you just lose a little bit of progress, but you're sort of back on track to resume next time you do it. Unfortunate rules.
Kaladen Shash 00:47:26 all right
Cletus Cobbington 00:47:36 Spend a really tedious amount of time drying off all my almonds. Now they're all fucking soggy.
Cyrus Schwert 00:47:42 Thank you, dude. Going to be so much better.
Dungeon Master 00:47:51 But to start your day, yes? Yeah, what are you working on? And do you have, and do you have like material for that? Did you, I think you bought some or something, right?
Leopold Magnus 00:47:51 Jonathan, I was just going to say, could I work on the steel defender while we're at camp? I'm trying to tune up his armor class a little bit and upgrade his current armor suit.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:19 Yeah, I thought we, I don't know if I have it specifically in my inventory, but you said that just depending on how common it is, I'll probably have it. And then I did get like money and stuff that I could buy things with. I guess, uh, let's see, I also have this phoenix feather.
Dungeon Master 00:48:33 Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:42 Let's see, could I work on a piece of armor that gives like a little bit of a bonus? Right now he's just at a 15, some kind of bonus and then like weave in the Phoenix feather to give it fire resistance.
Dungeon Master 00:48:58 Yeah, let me find the closest spell to that. We'll just use the G-enchanting guide. Okay, this will be similar to Caledon's ring, and this is going to be 32 hours of work total. I know you've done some work on it before, so we'll knock off
Dungeon Master 00:49:27 eight hours off of that. And I'll just start you at 26, 24, I mean, instead. And we'll say you've had one successful check and do it. So DC-14, yours would be tinkering, which I believe you do have a modifier for. But how much time are you spending on it? Go ahead and give me...
Cletus Cobbington 00:49:40 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:49:50 I'll just spend the rest of the evening, the downtime, working on it. Is tinkering a skill? I'm not seeing that. No, I'm not proficient in sleight of hand. I would say our
Dungeon Master 00:49:56 There's something listed in the class somewhere that says, like, how to add it. I think it's just, like, a dexterity plus proficiency, which should be very equivalent to, like, a slide of hand if you're proficient in that, but I almost say, you're class in it. Right. I'm sorry, like, the equivalent of that.
Cletus Cobbington 00:50:17 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:50:19 Yeah, depending on what. Okay, yeah, I guess all I have is like Arcana. Additional skills. I get out a custom one.
Cyrus Schwert 00:50:27 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:50:47 We'll just call it... I swear to God, there is something for it. Yeah, we'll just use your arcana. A plus eight is, like, proficiency, plus whatever. Yeah, I'm cool with that.
Leopold Magnus 00:51:11 Okay. Oh, there it is. Natural 20.
Dungeon Master 00:51:19 Natural 20. That will count that as two more successes. So of the four total you needed, you have three. You have, I'll say the armor class part isn't holding yet because you did get money, but you got the money outside of the dome and there's no steel or metal workers in the wild. So you haven't had like a ready source of extra metal to integrate into it.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:24 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:51:45 But you do like find pieces of your armor that you like cut out knowing your body is going to sort of mend and create more with time. So like you're working on the armor class part, but you do see that you're making really good progress. You had like his energy core envelop the Phoenix feather. And you see that it's not consistent yet, but he seems to have like,
Cletus Cobbington 00:51:58 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 00:52:08 uh almost a radiating fire aura at some points like he gets like almost like a flickering circuit like it's not there yet but you can tell that you're really on to some uh consider that phoenix feather consumed because it is in use
Leopold Magnus 00:52:19 Cool. Nice. I'll delete that out of my inventory.
Cyrus Schwert 00:52:23 Do I get the almond again?
Dungeon Master 00:52:34 Okay. Unless there's something else for that night. Next morning, who's left to make a survival and an encounter check? Up to Trace.
Cletus Cobbington 00:52:54 Uh, yeah. Give you another soggy, soggy almond. Didn't get to use it last time, so try again. Well, it's actually, unless I decide to use someone new, it just stays the same. So you don't have to grudgingly eat another wet almond. You still have this. Okay, that's the technical, but I don't tell him, so I keep feeding him salty almonds.
Cyrus Schwert 00:52:55 who gets the one. Oh my god.
Kaladen Shash 00:52:58 It's all good.
Dungeon Master 00:53:02 Doggy warm almond. No, I think it's really funny if he has to eat that really slow again.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:23 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 00:53:23 No, that one was also in Chip's mouth, actually. I said I was going to try and say it was set in stone. You know how hard it is to keep almonds out of Chip's mouth. It's nearly impossible, especially the special ones.
Cyrus Schwert 00:53:23 It pissed rain. It was going to be dry this time. It sucks. I thought you said you were going to try. Whatever. It's fine.
Dungeon Master 00:53:40 He was going to try, but he doesn't guarantee that it's dry. Um... Encounter survival. Let's go. Who's doing what?
Cyrus Schwert 00:53:50 Yeah, I know. I'm like elbowing a lot of the way. It's suffering. Get the fuck away from me, Chip. I'm doing something. We're just going to keep talking about Pullman's and complaining. We don't roll.
Cletus Cobbington 00:53:56 You and Chip are like siblings, like pushing each other. Oh, I think Leapold needs survival. Yeah, and I think we should. Well, everyone else has it.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:58 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:54:01 Oh, I'm rolling a survival check. I have a plus zero, so. Okay. Okay. I see. Well, there you go.
Dungeon Master 00:54:15 The summary is going to be so one track. Yeah, yeah. That's fine. Everybody's got to rotate and do it. Again, we...
Kaladen Shash 00:54:31 It's a tough, very, very tough journey, very tough. Oh, wow. This is a while this horse. This horse is going to last like six weeks.
Cletus Cobbington 00:54:31 I rolled it. It rolled right off the 20. We're all the way back at actual home now. I'm trapped in my willow fort. I can't get out. I can't dislodge the staff.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:34 We're going to be level 15 by the time we get to the other side of the forest. Crazy. No. We're back at the original dome. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:54:35 Oh, and a two. Jesus Christ. We're never going to get out of here.
Cyrus Schwert 00:54:37 Oh my fucking God. We're stuck in the forest.
Dungeon Master 00:54:44 I don't know. I will describe it. I will describe it, but then we're going to have to build a map real quick. You guys, there is.
Cletus Cobbington 00:55:01 Hi. No, you don't.
Kaladen Shash 00:55:06 Yeah, that's, yeah. He just didn't anticipate the low. It's okay.
Cyrus Schwert 00:55:08 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:55:12 There is, I didn't think you're going to roll it too. I mean, that's ridiculous. You guys are making a lot of forward progress at this point. There is a light consistent rain at this point. It is not soaking you. It's just like constantly present. You know, hold your shield over your head kind of rain where it's fine at that point. But very trudgingly, you make your way through the force, the constant rain. You're making light chatter, conversing.
Cletus Cobbington 00:55:32 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:55:42 Caledon, through general conversation, you find out that Cyrus, before going to the Amber Fields, lived in the sweet districts. You have that in common that you didn't know about. He grew up there, born and raised. No other people have sort of a connection. He said that.
Cyrus Schwert 00:55:52 I have to do that I have to do some math. I know the vibe in human years.
Kaladen Shash 00:55:57 How old is clean, how old is? Yeah. Yeah, but that's like full elf stuff. Oh, I should be in my like,
Zariel Torgan 00:56:01 You.
Dungeon Master 00:56:10 half elf equivalent of 21 and you put yourself at 180? Yeah, so how old does Calden look in relation? And I'll just pick a number. Okay. So,
Cyrus Schwert 00:56:25 So I'm talking like 30 or 40 is what I am, probably like 35.
Kaladen Shash 00:56:27 I was going to say I was going to I should be in my like 30s easily at the 180 mark.
Cletus Cobbington 00:56:29 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:56:38 Caledon, thinking about it, you're like, oh, I know your dad. Like, we went to school together. But, like, they're not close with them. You know that he was an art major. They're kind of an influential, an affluential family. But there's no relation. And again, as soon as you could, you moved into the Legionaire bunk. So you didn't, you haven't been there in at least over a month at this point.
Cyrus Schwert 00:57:03 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 00:57:05 But you were very isolated before that kept to yourself. But again, this is just general chatter as you're making your way through. And then you hit this like very foggy opening in the brush, almost like grove. The trees grow up, but there's a huge break in the canopy. There's almost no trees in the central area. A large body of water.
Kaladen Shash 00:57:12 Very good.
Dungeon Master 00:57:29 incredibly murky uh to your left and very different from the rest there's almost like methane bubbles kind of popping out of it very infrequently and like steam sort of rises up it's apparently very warm you see large sort of stone shapes emerging out of it but there's no other foliage um you get a very um
Cletus Cobbington 00:57:49 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:57:54 like rank, accurate scent hangs in the air. There's almost no bugs in this immediate area. So you're like walking through the forest and there's the sound of the rain, the bugs, the animals, and you hit this opening. And it goes from that constant sound to almost deafening silence. Everybody give me a perception check as you sort of enter this space.
Kaladen Shash 00:58:23 Okay. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:58:24 Damn, Zarya, your perspective is too good. Nobody notices it but Zario and to some extent, Cyrus, I'll say like Cyrus maybe notices it first, but Zario you're sort of scanning. And you see that it's like, it almost looks like a pointed jagged rock and then there's like pointed jagged rocks behind it. And then the whole thing sort of shifts in the water ever so slightly.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:27 Yeah, it's pretty crazy.
Dungeon Master 00:58:56 And you're looking at it and you're like, that's not a rock. That looks like bone. That's like a horn. And then we're going to stop it right there because, again, I want to build a map for the fight you're going to have. So do what you guys want. I'm going to, yeah, lock in real quick.
Cyrus Schwert 00:59:13 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:59:17 um yeah jonathan can i have casted can i have casted uh find familiar in the morning awesome okay you guys would see that kind of all morning like circling over our heads was a like a large raven yeah
Dungeon Master 00:59:27 Yeah. Oh, he's got a name.
Cletus Cobbington 00:59:31 I hide Chip so fast in my overalls. Chip get down.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:39 Oh, cool. Oh, cool.
Kaladen Shash 00:59:46 Not Hawk. His name is Corvus. And he's... He's kind of a name. This is the first time you've seen Corvus. Because I learned this spell when I was growing my arm and had not had a chance to really cast it yet. It did. Sometimes...
Leopold Magnus 00:59:55 Is that the first time we've seen Corvus? Okay. Does that come along with the arm, or is that you...
Kaladen Shash 01:00:13 you know likes to live in the shoulder a little bit sometimes you know because like branches and vines so no nest no nest but i know like no nest but i think there's like a section that's like cagey enough that you can like sneak in for shelter like hop out yeah um
Cletus Cobbington 01:00:14 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:21 Oh, sick. Is there like birds nest or something? Like, how is it like hanging out in there? Okay. That's sick. Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:00:39 And he can speak but very simple words like a crow might like call like single words or something. So that's it. And then Jonathan's going to let me have them like use owl mechanics so that he could like hinder the enemy on the opposite side of me for advantage perhaps.
Cletus Cobbington 01:00:47 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:01:03 I will say that is the rule we're going by, but also important to remember that if you put, if you involve it in combat, it can be a target in combat. Yes. Okay. Is that true? I don't know that I knew that.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:13 And can be killed. Yeah. Yes. Underspent. No, I just bring them back. But you can only bring them back so many times. Yeah, I'm pretty sure you could totally bring. I'm pretty sure you're like, there's like a number. I don't have that wrong.
Cyrus Schwert 01:01:18 Oh, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:01:20 It's like a permanent thing. Oh, damn. So like zombie-fied when you bring it back? Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:01:43 Jesus. Yeah, it's why having a chip. That's why he's so fucked up.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:43 Yeah, one too many. Watch out. It's funny. It's funny. There's going to say that there's a movie that's getting ready to come out, and they called it Mickey 17, but it's based on a book called Mickey, like, seven.
Dungeon Master 01:01:48 That'd be funny. Oh, yeah, it's Robert Patton, right?
Leopold Magnus 01:01:54 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:01:56 He's been respond a lot of times.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:06 And they essentially, yeah, they essentially just recruit an individual when they go colonize these places, that they just clone over and over again. Because they send them out to do these jobs where they're likely going to get blown up. And they're like, cool, just bring them right back. Like, just, let me think of that. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:23 Jesus Christ. You just have a cloning lab of Corvus?
Cletus Cobbington 01:02:34 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:37 Yeah, I guess there's no number. I don't know what I'm thinking of. Maybe that was an old rule. Excellent.
Cyrus Schwert 01:02:41 Good.
Dungeon Master 01:02:46 Okay, I found a good enough map we're making progress. And then once I get the map made, I'm gonna get a quick smoke going.
Dungeon Master 01:03:15 Ready for this combat? I'm like, oh, I thought she went to Hawaii.
Leopold Magnus 01:03:19 Not a bad idea.
Cyrus Schwert 01:03:20 I got that down already.
Kaladen Shash 01:03:20 It's actually... Check. You said Jonathan and Travis, you guys would appreciate this. Trey's out of the office for like the week. She went to Japan with a friend. No, she went to Japan. She had a layover in Hawaii, but like just for a few hours. But anyway, she's in Japan. But the...
Dungeon Master 01:03:47 Well, that's what I saw them. No. That's what I saw them. That trap.
Kaladen Shash 01:03:51 The office is absolutely like just falling apart. Like Laura has no idea of anything to do or where it is or I just love it. Like it just cracks me up.
Cletus Cobbington 01:03:52 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:04:07 It sounds about right.
Leopold Magnus 01:04:07 Kind of like run around like a chicken with their head cut off.
Kaladen Shash 01:04:11 Yeah, and then we're like, we're talking about, we're like talking about hiring some new aides, and Sawyer or our lead aide was like, oh, this person reached out again, like speaking directly to my director. And they were like, she was like, oh, we can't make any choices until Tray's back. I don't do that. I was like, Laura, what do you do here? Yeah. I was like, oh, my goodness.
Dungeon Master 01:04:20 Oh, don't talk about them too much. Even though she's the boss.
Kaladen Shash 01:04:40 It's just because she does so little. Honestly, Jonathan, like this week she has had like three, four, she had two. She has two clients tomorrow. She's like working so little. It's crazy. It's crazy. She only comes in for those patients and then sometimes she's here for like,
Dungeon Master 01:04:53 Oh. Is she in the office still or if she's just only coming in for those patients? Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:05:02 Her and Trey will have these meetings where she's on, like, they're on video together in the office for like an hour or so. So she'll extend her day for the meeting. Yeah, she's just not there much. Doing something. I mean, I know she does other things for the company, but she's not that. No.
Cyrus Schwert 01:05:19 living a lie? Not that much. Yeah, bad. How's the snow over there, too?
Dungeon Master 01:05:32 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:05:47 Decent, no bad. But Nike is our pussies, but I'm thankful. So they just shut down campus for today and tomorrow. So didn't that work? But, you know, they also have to think about, like, how much of snow? Like, inch and a half, maybe. Maybe inch, something like that?
Kaladen Shash 01:05:50 How much did it? Yeah. Oh, man, that's a fair bit for over there. It came down. Shut it down.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:12 Oh, geez. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:06:16 It's dumped. For sure. We're looking far out of, I'm a street. I'm looking far out on the street. This is not.
Cletus Cobbington 01:06:20 But that's in like a non-windy spot. So I don't know. Maybe the technical like citywide is probably around an inch. Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:06:30 Yeah, no, that's okay. When I was working in Lake Oswego, like, each time it would snow, my boss would be like, hey, Brendan, do you think you can make it? We know it snowed. I'd be like, I'll be like, I'm good. I'll be there. It's funny, though.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:46 I read this thread on Reddit of people complaining that they didn't close schools here in town. And I was like, what on earth are you guys like, where are you from? Yeah. Yeah, it's like, have you ever lived a winter here in town? Like,
Kaladen Shash 01:06:52 Yeah. No, no. It's it's the newest wave of people that have come. Like people cancel all the time now. Like I used to never get cancels for like just a little bit of snow. And now it's like all the time. They're like, oh, it's happening. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:07:09 No, that's the thing. Yeah, it was a little slick on the way at home, but it wasn't too bad. Yeah, I think it's your demographic on that side of town, too, though, because we don't get too much, unless they're, like, super old or live far away.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:11 Yeah, anyhow, yeah. I mean, it's like, today was a little bit of snow, but like they had it plowed off like almost first thing in the morning. So.
Kaladen Shash 01:07:22 Right. Sure.
Cletus Cobbington 01:07:34 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:07:41 Like today, this morning, our first patient was from Ontario. Like, she's still here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I mean, it's worse up there for sure, but, like, still. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:42 Yeah. Oh Jesus. That's a long ways.
Kaladen Shash 01:07:54 Yeah, when I have people that live on, when I have people that live on Aubrey youth, they're like, I'm not going anywhere. I'm like, okay, whatever. Right, right. Yeah. Right, right. Right. Right. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:08:09 Like, when we went this golfing up there and there's snow all over the place, like, there's nothing in the rest of town. I didn't even know it's like anywhere. So.
Dungeon Master 01:08:21 um to contribute to that on the way home was slick as fuck i that um azure to um greenwood that just like little on the highway section i spun out for like 15 full seconds because my car would not get traction and i just do one of those slow like slides it's just like it's just uphill at the very last second
Kaladen Shash 01:08:39 Oh my goodness.
Dungeon Master 01:08:47 So like it's very flat and then it goes to very flat and then your car stops on a hill and it was so slick that I just couldn't get traction. There was a Subaru in front of me who was doing the same thing and I didn't judge him, but I didn't think it was going to be the battle like that guy can't drive in the snow as he's like trawling.
Dungeon Master 01:09:03 crawling and then he's got four wheel joint so he gets out and then I pull up and I fucking get stuck for 20 I mean it doesn't sound like a lot but in a car with somebody behind you waiting 20 seconds is so long just come made me wish that I had my chains on
Cyrus Schwert 01:09:06 Sometimes there's such a hassle to put up.
Kaladen Shash 01:09:15 Yeah, forever.
Zariel Torgan 01:09:20 Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:09:31 Yeah. And I haven't put them on since moving to bed. So keep that streak up. Oh, that's cute. I shoveled the driveway when I got home. I'm ready now if you guys are.
Cletus Cobbington 01:09:34 We're good. We're good.
Cyrus Schwert 01:09:40 Yeah, it's not too bad. We did snow angels behind the house this evening. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:10:04 Let me sign.
Dungeon Master 01:10:15 Everybody ready? He probably? He probably went and he's plowing the roads.
Cyrus Schwert 01:10:19 have you pulled in jail. I haven't heard from Zareel yet. Just to keep, he's like a village owner. Like, he's the fucking variant of a small village where he has to do all the work he's the king.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:20 All good here.
Kaladen Shash 01:10:20 Yes. It's what it looks.
Dungeon Master 01:10:45 Have you been to the property yet? Oh, awesome. We're definitely going to be playing D&D in the summer at some point, but Jesse is obviously some of the best person you know. He lets us like stay up there when we, so we play D&D in one of the cabins. Oh, it's so cool to like just get absolutely fucking rocked and stoned and you like go and paddleboard on the lake that's just right there and then you play D&D and shit. That's.
Kaladen Shash 01:10:56 Yeah. Really fun. Those are a great way to finish
Cyrus Schwert 01:11:00 It's
Leopold Magnus 01:11:10 Yeah, that's super dope. Just remember that one, yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:11:12 This is.
Dungeon Master 01:11:15 It's awesome. It's so cool. Oh, we're talking shit about you. Don't tell them guys.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:20 Hey, I'm back. Sorry. Yeah. That sounds about right. Oh, geez. All right. Oh, thank you. Let's do it. Where are we at?
Cyrus Schwert 01:11:31 He's saying nice things about you guys. You ready to rip? We haven't started. Just like the shit dogs. Those are in. No.
Cletus Cobbington 01:11:46 We now have map. That's where we're at.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:49 Nice, very swampy. Have we rolled the initiative yet?
Dungeon Master 01:12:00 You see this horn that you just barely saw move. Evidently you guys were being watched because the moment that you pay just enough attention to it that it's even somewhat obvious that you're looking at it. You see large black form sort of emerge out of the swampy water.
Dungeon Master 01:12:28 iridescent black scales glint and drip with this murky water you see these huge wings sort of unfold and then step back onto its form the jagged horn on the front of the face travels back over the top of the head and then down the back of what you see to be a large black dragon
Cletus Cobbington 01:12:36 This force sucks got T-Rexes and dragons.
Kaladen Shash 01:12:53 I'm going on.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:54 Damn.
Cyrus Schwert 01:12:54 Who did this to us again? What the hell is going on?
Dungeon Master 01:13:02 Everybody go ahead and roll initiative.
Cletus Cobbington 01:13:10 Lucky 13. I swear to God, if I end his maw, I'm going home. A sweet retreat to my almonds. I will give up adventuring. Hey.
Leopold Magnus 01:13:19 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:13:25 as you're going to end up in the mall.
Kaladen Shash 01:13:25 This is what for dinner? Wait. You got to make, you got to have cannon. Do you have hands? Are you like bovine in it? Like. There you go.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:30 All these monsters like eating beef. Mm-hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 01:13:38 I hold up a hoof. What do you mean by that? No, I'm kidding. I don't, I don't have hooves. I think that's a little bit too far. It is really funny to picture, but no. I don't. I don't know. I definitely got hands.
Dungeon Master 01:13:45 I don't know. What are we talking about? What do you mean?
Kaladen Shash 01:13:56 Ha ha ha ha ha.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:01 Yeah, well, you handle almonds. How could you reach into a bag of almonds with hooves? Minotaur.
Cyrus Schwert 01:14:06 I feel like the backbeat could be hooves. I feel like the backbeat could be hooves. Like a... Yeah, okay, from Garn. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:14:08 I just, you know. All right. I did like those pictures, the pictures that I made that had the hose. Maybe, okay, I got, I got hoot feet. Maybe that's why I'm real bad at stealth. They always clack around on the, on this. I've been peer pressure to have hooved feet, so I have whomed feet.
Kaladen Shash 01:14:28 click slack a little yeah what is yeah what is uh yes
Leopold Magnus 01:14:28 Are you, you're making that cannon. You have hoof feet. Jonathan, what?
Dungeon Master 01:14:29 Hey, I like it. You are a fur bog, so you technically, I think you do have hub speech. Furbolks are cowmen.
Cletus Cobbington 01:14:45 I don't think that's no. I think that's only because the critical role dude. Furbogs are like hairy little giants. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:48 Yeah, I think so.
Leopold Magnus 01:14:59 What is this scene like? So are we in the forest or do we come under a clearing and then, you know, the dragon kind of swooped down? It came out of the water. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:15:05 This is a dry spot. This is a dry spot within the bog. It came out of the water. Is that what happened? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:15:11 Do you guys see the map? Cool. We'll just call that accurate, just so I don't have to have you guys have imaginary barriers that aren't there. Cyrus, I don't know why it always shows you as being dead.
Cyrus Schwert 01:15:14 Yeah. I don't know. It works sometimes. I don't know. It works sometimes. I don't know why it does that. I, like, take my long rest again, and then it still doesn't work.
Cletus Cobbington 01:15:16 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 01:15:42 Okay. That's what we do. Anyway, Cyrus, you were at the top of initiatives. It took you out. Let me put you back in. Like it's size? Oh, you are 40 feet away. And if you had to rate the creature, it seems like,
Cyrus Schwert 01:15:53 Okay, do we have a scale here? Kind of distance? Yeah. Okay. Okay. I see. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:16:10 huge in size. You've got that you've got that movement. I've got 35 if I physically pick your token up and move it.
Cyrus Schwert 01:16:24 I can get up in its business. I see 30. Okay. Then I get kind of close-ish within range for next time. Come here.
Cletus Cobbington 01:16:37 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:16:54 and I'll fucking cast wind wall at it I suppose I swing my sword as hard as I can and it like shoots out of wind. Oh yeah
Dungeon Master 01:17:15 Starting low on the ground, going forward, and then erupting into the sky you cast wind wall is the range of wind wall. Get there? And what is the size of it?
Cyrus Schwert 01:17:29 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and one foot thick. Each creature within its area makes a saving throw and takes bludgeoning damage from the wind on a fail. And then it keeps fog, smoke, and other gases away. Small flying creatures or objects can't go through it. Uh,
Cletus Cobbington 01:17:38 Does it act like a buffer or like what does it? What does it do? Oh shit.
Cyrus Schwert 01:17:59 arrows, bolts, and other things launched at it are deflected up and automatically miss. It's a strength, saving 14, I imagine he's going to get that, but we'll try it. Oh, let's call it was 14. Fails. Yeah, it takes 11 bludgeoning damage.
Dungeon Master 01:18:05 Okay, so what is the save on it? Not with a bad roll, that's a 12. Oh, nice. What happens? Oh, he takes the damage, gotcha.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:19 Cool.
Cletus Cobbington 01:18:23 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:18:30 3D8. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Um, and that... Um... I forget a bit of that. No. That's not this one. That's like dust or something like that, where they get knocked away. Like gust of wind or... That's the turn.
Dungeon Master 01:18:36 Is he knocked back? Is that what you said? Okay, just the image. Gotcha. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:19:02 for Cyrus.
Cletus Cobbington 01:19:04 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:19:05 The dragon will legendary action, spend two of them and do its wing attack. Nobody's within 10 feet of it, so nobody has to make the save, but it will there. It'll choose to move half of its movement as a flying speed. A certain amount. You see it goes. There.
Dungeon Master 01:19:35 out of the wind wall. So you see, you buffeted it with this wind, unexpectedly a huge log sort of rips from the water and strikes it sort of at its breast at its neck, sort of making a small gash, unexpectedly taking this damage. It sort of shunts back, lets out a huge roar, and then it throws its wings, giving it huge base, and then it dashes, almost lightning quick, right out of the bounds, and it sort of angles back. A good turn on it, though.
Dungeon Master 01:20:09 Up next then is Leopold.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:12 Ooh, see, am I muted? No. I think that with that, I'm going to try to spread out a little bit. Let's see. Okay, yeah, I could definitely spread out. So I will move over here.
Cletus Cobbington 01:20:33 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:42 Getting up in its business. Then I will take two attacks with my sword on it as an action. 19 to hit? Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:20:53 Okay. Go ahead and roll your attacks. 19 just hits. Nice. Help the roll.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:03 Hmm. Nice.
Kaladen Shash 01:21:04 Okay. Back some of them up critical.
Leopold Magnus 01:21:08 All right, so 26 will connect. So on the first strike, oh, solid 14 points of damage with an additional all six points of damage. So 20 on the first swing. Oh, let's go. 12 and another three. Okay, so 15.
Cyrus Schwert 01:21:22 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:21:35 So that's a total of 35 damage on the swings. Then I will kick out Bone Crusher. He didn't appear to take any modified damage with that flame. He seemed like it hurt him. I'll kick out Bone Crusher and...
Dungeon Master 01:21:39 Yeah, good hit. Yeah, everything seemed to hold.
Leopold Magnus 01:22:07 Does he have room to maneuver? Like he wouldn't take an attack of opportunity if he popped out my back, right? I guess maybe let's just say I kicked him out before he got within the area of attack. Is that possible?
Dungeon Master 01:22:16 No, force movement in general doesn't, but also if he stays in its space, he can maneuver around without taking an attack. Yeah?
Leopold Magnus 01:22:36 Okay, so for my bonus action, I'll kick out Bone Crusher, and I'll make him kind of retreat and stand over here. And I'll yell at him, attack with your cadden, Bone Crusher. And then that will be my turn, and then Bone Crusher will do a firebolt. Ah, misses.
Dungeon Master 01:23:00 Go and roll the hint. I go find your stupid. Wherever I put it. Yes, Mrs. After that will be Cletus.
Cletus Cobbington 01:23:15 All right. Hi. Let's see. Oh, that's, whatever. I'm going to cast Conjure Woodland Beans, and I'm going to bring back my four saders. Do you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:23:40 They need to roll an initiative, which I don't know if they have any plus. We got a wonderful tube. Yeah. Nice and go nice and last.
Dungeon Master 01:23:46 I'll do that in just the second. Sorry, I have to go find the last map I can remember putting the steel offender on. I mean, it has to have a custom image to be that one. So they have two on their initiative? Is that what you're saying? That's okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:23:47 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:23:54 Oh, you don't have to use the same token. You should put a different one. Uh.
Cletus Cobbington 01:24:19 And then while you're doing that, I'm just going to shalee my staff as my bonus action. That's for you. I'm just going to, I'll probably move my feed back and have them kind of just like in front of me kind of thing.
Dungeon Master 01:24:29 And how many staters do you summon? Is it four?
Cletus Cobbington 01:24:50 If I get hit, they're Rizzlers, my fort. Riz, Stiz, Bizz, and Tiz. Those are my Sater's name. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:24:50 That looks creepy. That gets five. That gets five. Boom.
Dungeon Master 01:24:58 Call. And you said their initiative is two. Or do they have a bonus to it? What's their Dax?
Leopold Magnus 01:25:03 The Rizzlers.
Cletus Cobbington 01:25:22 I don't think so. Plus three, so that be five. Yep, that's me. That be my action. Yep, that's me. That be my action.
Dungeon Master 01:25:30 That'd be five. Okay. And you stay sort of huddled behind them. Anything else, sir? Your field defender where you want it.
Leopold Magnus 01:25:52 Oh, I was thinking of putting him like, I guess for that, yeah, probably over here, because I don't know what the range of that breath weapon is. Yeah, like right here. I think he has 30 feet of movement.
Dungeon Master 01:26:10 I mean, what's his movement? You can only put him so far, right? He's currently 35 feet away from him. So he'll just be slightly right there in line with where you want it. Okay. Oh, cool. Then right where you want him. Is that action bonus action?
Leopold Magnus 01:26:22 Okay. Oh, he has 40 feet. It's 5 more than Leo, 10 more than Leopold. Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:26:44 Alrighty then, Caledon is your go. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:26:50 Um, you still, I think, like 35 feet for me. I'll use my first action to cast a nesoptic blast, try to do some force damage. That spells, not actions. Uh, 16's going to miss, and I'll go ahead and do, uh, I think it's arc lash. I'll activate that.
Dungeon Master 01:27:18 Can I hit? When he hits?
Kaladen Shash 01:27:19 on light splitter. And I'll take two swings from distance. First one's going to hit it, 29. Second one's going to hit. First one does 19. And second one, sweet.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:35 Nice. Jesus Christ.
Dungeon Master 01:27:48 Damn. Damn. Good for you. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:27:50 Those are better rules, though. That's good. Max that D6 both times. Goodness. And then I'll use some movement for a good weapon. I'll use a little bit of movement to spread apart.
Cyrus Schwert 01:27:51 And.
Leopold Magnus 01:27:56 Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:28:18 Go ahead and move yourself where you want. After that, trace, it is your Seder groups. Oh, where did the dragon read? It's right there.
Cletus Cobbington 01:28:26 All right. Let's see, they're 30-thirty-ish feet. Cool. Caders. All right, I'm going to have them all shoot their little short bows at them. These are two Nat-20s. What the hell?
Dungeon Master 01:28:52 She.
Kaladen Shash 01:28:52 Well, I mean.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:52 Damn. They add. They add. Oh, got you.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:54 Jeez.
Cyrus Schwert 01:28:54 Do they have to be close to them?
Cletus Cobbington 01:28:56 Okay. So five and eight. A 17 and two net 20s. Really, I added the plus five to them. So 17, two net 20s. Huh? They're shooting short throws.
Dungeon Master 01:29:22 I mean, roll your damage. So you have, yeah, so it's how many, there's four of them, they each take one attack. Okay, so Nat 20, Nat 20, 8, the Sport 12 misses. Okay, two hits, two Nat 20s. And what's the damage on those?
Cletus Cobbington 01:29:27 Well, how many hit? Three. Yeah. So I did four dies. So I'm a six eight doesn't seven and eight.
Cletus Cobbington 01:29:52 17 misses, okay. Damage would be 1d6 plus. Okay, 1d6 plus 3, so 46 plus 34. Oh, didn't know amazing, the 22.
Dungeon Master 01:29:56 19 justice. So that's 46 plus. Wow.
Cyrus Schwert 01:30:02 46-12.
Zariel Torgan 01:30:09 Mm-hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 01:30:22 That's crazy, Tina Twins. And, yeah, there's going to chill there. Yes, Rizzlers.
Dungeon Master 01:30:26 Yeah, that's good. Okay. That was a nasty turn. At the end of their turn, before its turn, it'll use its last legendary action and do a tail attack on Leopold since he's just right there.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:54 Okay. Oh, that misses. Damn. Yeah, I'll take the attack.
Dungeon Master 01:30:55 Jesus. Why is it every time we go into combat? I roll like fucking shit. It's a 14 to hit. Okay. It will take the attack of opportunity as it flies past you at the start of its turn. So, legendary action tail attack misses. Start of its turn moves to right there. You can take an attack if you'd like to.
Leopold Magnus 01:31:26 Uh, not one. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:31:37 misses unfortunately. It let the first thing it does is it'll use its frightful presence. So everybody, including the Sater's and unless the steel defender can't be, it's going to use
Cyrus Schwert 01:31:48 We see in the only time. I'll be able to.
Dungeon Master 01:32:06 That frightful presence ever makes a DC-16 wisdom saving thorough or become frightened for one minute. They get a man. Natural 29th. Stop pritting. That'd be really cool. Kind of ridiculous. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:32:13 All right.
Cletus Cobbington 01:32:15 uh so the satyrs have magic resistance they roll with advantage on saving throws
Zariel Torgan 01:32:24 Yeah. Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Kaladen Shash 01:32:30 You said wisdom. Yeah. Not the first dragon that I've seen, you know. Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:32:36 Wisdom save. Save. Save with 16. Okay, 24.
Cletus Cobbington 01:32:44 All right, this is 4. Nat 20 again for one of the Saders. And a 13 for the other one. Then I got a roll one. And I got a 24. Okay, so one Sater.
Leopold Magnus 01:32:49 Dude, what are they on?
Dungeon Master 01:33:05 Leopold fails. What do the Sators add? Viet. A. A. So it'll be 10, 20, 20, the 13 and 3, so 13 fails. So the second one fails. So the next four will be the remaining two.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:12 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:33:13 Wait, I need to roll much more than four. I need to do another set of four. I don't, they have plus zero with wisdom. And then a 19 and a 17. So one failed.
Dungeon Master 01:33:41 Um, 1960. Yeah, the rest of them succeed. Okay. So you in your head tell me which one is frightened, which of the line? Which. That makes sense. Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:51 Thanks.
Cletus Cobbington 01:33:53 Tiz, the one on the closest to the Dragon Eagle. Look it. I guess. Yeah. The Rizzlers don't back down.
Leopold Magnus 01:34:10 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:34:13 It'll use its acid breath. So that hits, unfortunately, the biggest target with all of the attacks you just did, the double knot 20s. It'll let its acid breath. It'll hit just barely unless you want to spread them more out. I laid it out. We're all good. You and all of your shaders must make a dexterity saving throw.
Cletus Cobbington 01:34:44 Okay, rolling for four things every time is really tedious. Okay, I don't think they have any decks so plus three. So what I just do plus three? Do I have to do plus 12 when I do these? When I'm rolling four. I'll just add them.
Kaladen Shash 01:34:48 So you could take Or you could, yeah, because it's just going to add it all up. That's what's going to happen every time, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:34:59 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 01:35:02 It doesn't add it like that. You have to roll them separately to get the bonus on each one. Yeah. 1860s.
Cyrus Schwert 01:35:03 It won't do it like that. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:35:13 So plus three to all of those, and then it's a deck save, you said. Oh, I rolled a 12. They had an 18, a 6, a dirty, 20, and a 19. Oh, I give that a doom. Sorry.
Dungeon Master 01:35:31 30 20 succeeds, 19 succeeds. You in one of them fail. Cleetus, you take 60 points of acid damage. One of your staters take 60. The other three take 30. They take half that. Jesus.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:37 Oh, fuck.
Kaladen Shash 01:35:42 Oh, my goodness. Yeah, I just saw that roll. You know. Look, look at all the sixes. Eight over six.
Cletus Cobbington 01:35:53 My God. Okay, one's marked and then the other three are on one HP. And I'm damn near on one HP too. These damn reptilian beasts.
Cyrus Schwert 01:35:59 What does that part? We got fucked.
Leopold Magnus 01:36:00 They're hanging in there, man. Hanging in there.
Dungeon Master 01:36:13 And then after that, it is Zaria.
Zariel Torgan 01:36:18 First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to ask in the, like, in-ear communications we all have. Would anybody like to be a big ape? If not, I've got other stuff. I'll just take, like, a second and a half. I don't think Polymorph makes you lose concentration.
Cletus Cobbington 01:36:33 Would being an ape cancel my concentration? And it's not me using it, so I'm assuming I would keep it, correct?
Cyrus Schwert 01:36:33 of the
Leopold Magnus 01:36:42 Who drew it, aren't?
Kaladen Shash 01:36:43 You're a druid. Yeah, I think it... What if you polymorphed one of his things into a fucking giantate? Some damage. Yes, that's...
Zariel Torgan 01:36:50 I don't know. I'd have to defer to Jonathan. I don't think... Well... Yeah. Let me see.
Cletus Cobbington 01:36:58 I mean, I would vote me just for sake of that would give me some HP buffer. And ability to actually do good damage myself, sacrificing my Sators. But if it gets rid of the Sators, it is what it is. They're going to die soon anyway. They're at 1.8.
Cyrus Schwert 01:37:03 hit points. Yeah, I think it's fine.
Kaladen Shash 01:37:12 Load it up. Load it up. Maximize.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:18 I guess they've only got it like one hit point. What do you say? All right, yeah, if you're cool that, Jonathan, uh, yeah, I go ahead and cast.
Cletus Cobbington 01:37:28 I mean, I'm good. John. Okay. Turn me into a dragon. I'm a mega almond. Okay. I'm a mega almond. Okay. I'm an ape.
Dungeon Master 01:37:30 I'm down for it.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:41 I'm going to say, well, it's going to be a little different. And you're the same, like, hot pink giant ape.
Cyrus Schwert 01:37:48 You make this cool. No. I'm not talking about. Absolutely not.
Cletus Cobbington 01:37:56 That's where we draw the line. So is this giant apes stats?
Dungeon Master 01:38:08 Okay. Why did you just move everybody? You don't know how, but you absolutely did? You must have them selected.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:08 I'll move my, move myself over about here. Oh, did I? I did. Weird. Yeah, but I didn't, I must have done it early and then hadn't clicked it on the map in a while.
Kaladen Shash 01:38:19 That was interesting. They dragged everybody a little bit to the left. Yeah, that's cool.
Cyrus Schwert 01:38:20 What's that?
Dungeon Master 01:38:37 Sorry, Jesse, but you're in trouble. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:38 Sorry about that. All right. Yeah, giant ape. And then I don't really have any bonus action, so I will move over to there and chill. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:38:41 This is giant ape stats, right? Cool. That's some crisp HP. Calling the Rizzlers.
Kaladen Shash 01:38:48 Stone.
Dungeon Master 01:39:11 After your turn, that's the other round. I read Legendary Actions. Oh, restart its turn. It'll use a legendary action. This bone crusher is just within 10 feet. He will take, he needs to make a dexterity saving throw. He's going to take 2D6 plus 6.
Leopold Magnus 01:39:36 Ouch. Let's see, what is this? Degs. Oh, plus four, not bad. Doesn't help if you roll bad. So what was it?
Dungeon Master 01:39:43 15 points of damage. And it will move. And it will move
Zariel Torgan 01:39:54 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:39:56 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:39:56 215.
Leopold Magnus 01:40:00 Okay, that's, yeah, full damage, 15 points. All right.
Dungeon Master 01:40:13 Um, go ahead and, um, everybody give me just an insight check as you see this creature. But as it does that you see, it very carefully moves up and around and then down at Zario as you've moved at space.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:37 I'm making up for all those natural ones earlier.
Dungeon Master 01:40:40 Jesus Christ, Jesse. How many rolls above 20 are you going to do? Yeah, I guess. You notice as it's coming at you, it's not...
Cyrus Schwert 01:40:40 That's great. That's really.
Dungeon Master 01:41:00 highly intelligent, but you see there is intelligence behind its eyes. It is like watching the feel. It saw what you just did and it has like a natural sense of magic. Think of it as like the arcane equivalent of a lateral line on a shark. Like it just gets the ping of what you just did casting and it directs its attention directly at you and up and over and it flies right at you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:41:16 The Rizzlers were scared.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:24 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:41:29 not allowing you to continue to be a threat. This creature will probably act maliciously against the strongest fighters. It's not going to take chances. And I'll say you just get that. Start the round Cyrus as you were going to go.
Cletus Cobbington 01:41:47 Oh. Oh.
Cyrus Schwert 01:41:51 All right. Well, I'm in his fucking business now. Let's fucking go. I charged the dragon. And I could attack it with my soul with my... 22 to head on the first one.
Dungeon Master 01:41:59 202 hit. 28 hits. 28 hits.
Cyrus Schwert 01:42:20 I pick my two attacks. What is this? And at 28. So I'm going to do a defensive four-ish on one of them. So he needs the first attack. Here's the second attack. Plus 2D6. One free from those.
Cyrus Schwert 01:42:50 So we're at 30 damage total so far, and then an extra, an extra six, and then my AC goes up by six until my next turn. Um, and that should do it, because that was actually done as action with rush, I guess.
Dungeon Master 01:42:54 Nice. You see this creature on.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:01 Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:43:18 heavy hits and each time most things are just like small piercing things not a huge amount of damage so first the wind wall and now these these strikes that hit and then almost explode with energy that you sort of force through the blade you're doing significant damage to it enough so that at the end of your turn it's going to use its last legendary action and do a tail attack on you
Cyrus Schwert 01:43:47 EC's 26 for this round. No.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:49 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:43:50 Yeah. 17 doesn't help that I rolled a 6. You know, that obviously misses. But then it's Leopold's go. With advantage.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:02 Hell yeah. Let's go. So I'll come in for the flank and do another two strikes of my sword. Yes, sir. You're an adventurer now. What the...
Cyrus Schwert 01:44:19 I'm fighting a fucking dragon. He's looking stereotyping. I jump over his tail as he's like it.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:21 Uh-huh.
Kaladen Shash 01:44:26 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:29 Okay, I don't know what the fuck just happened. Nevermind. Uh, somehow rolled three. Which one rolled first? Yeah, okay. Uh, well, just ignore that. Okay. 27 to hit. On the first strike, and then on the second one,
Dungeon Master 01:44:41 He rolled a super advantage is what happened. It's worth it.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:08 24 to hit, so they'll both connect. So on the first slash, 12 damage plus another 3, so 15 damage on that swing. Let's go, baby, another 12 damage.
Cletus Cobbington 01:45:10 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:45:11 You guys are rolling very high.
Kaladen Shash 01:45:17 Thanks.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:25 Nice. Jesus. Ugh.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:28 five damage there. So 17 damage with those two strikes. And then as a bonus action, I will pull my magic stones from the earth and animate them. And then that's Leopold's turn, but Bone Crusher, having been told to fire, will levy another fire bolt. Hopefully his aim's a little better. 18 to hit. I think it was 19 was the AC, right?
Dungeon Master 01:45:44 18 myths. Okay, after your turn, Cetus, you are a giant ape.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:56 Mm-hmm
Cletus Cobbington 01:45:59 all right let's go let's go oh what okay i think i'm confused just like everybody else multi-attack ape makes two fist attacks that's only when i use the fist i can't use the rock and then two fist attacks as far as
Leopold Magnus 01:46:00 So that goes wide, and that's my turn.
Cyrus Schwert 01:46:15 Jerusalem.
Kaladen Shash 01:46:28 Right. Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:46:28 The description is one or the other. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:46:30 Okay. Um, well, fuck it. I'm charging this bitch. I'm charging this bitch. I'm going to charge up on him and swing my, my fist. Let's see what a plus nine to hit. So I'm just going to take both attacks here. Flash Mar 2D 20.
Zariel Torgan 01:46:42 Uh-huh, mm.
Cletus Cobbington 01:47:04 Two threes. I've never done fist-to-fist combat. I'm a spellcaster. I use those fists to bang my chest, and I give up. Okay, well, that's really sad.
Kaladen Shash 01:47:09 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:47:17 You run up, jump over your satyrs, go to take a swing, and you see that, like, it, with its claw, like, blocks one, and then throws your hand down to block your other fist, sort of like throwing you into yourself.
Zariel Torgan 01:47:17 Ha ha.
Cletus Cobbington 01:47:35 to it's added. Avenge my fist.
Dungeon Master 01:47:44 unfortunate round, but then it's Caledans go.
Kaladen Shash 01:47:51 Um, before, before moving into the, to the dragon space, I'm going to cast the soft blast one more time. It does nothing. Goosephers straight up into the air. And I'll use my movement to, like, screw it around so that I can get into, uh, planking position with the giant ant, please.
Kaladen Shash 01:48:18 I'll take two attacks with light splitter close range. And the roll. That hurts. That doesn't hit.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:22 Nice. Oof. Again with the two threes.
Dungeon Master 01:48:46 That's tough. Nice.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:47 Some, you lose some.
Kaladen Shash 01:48:48 I know, that's all right. Do it again. Okay, got the one. For 22, though, swing of me.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:56 Hey. Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:49:22 Already already. After that, it is the Sators.
Cletus Cobbington 01:49:27 All right, three of them left. It's gonna have them shoot again. Let's see. Slash hard 3D 20. 30, 29 and 14.
Dungeon Master 01:49:52 Dirty 20 hits. Damn. Nice. Nice, 8 damage.
Cletus Cobbington 01:49:58 Plus three. Come on, big damn. Oh, I did R slash, damn it. All right. Hey, big eight damage. And the Rizzlers, the other two that missed just do a little gritty jig.
Kaladen Shash 01:50:06 Slashore. So, so close.
Zariel Torgan 01:50:27 No, that's okay. No, that's okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:50:30 All right. That's the Sators. They're just going to stay there. Nah.
Dungeon Master 01:50:33 Okay. At the start of its turn, the dragon ceased to get rules to see if it gets its breath weapon back. That is a... Who, it does not. Wow. You guys have got me in a pickle. Fully surrounded, not looking good. Um...
Leopold Magnus 01:50:47 Uh-huh.
Zariel Torgan 01:50:57 It's right. Just fly away.
Dungeon Master 01:51:03 How much HP do we have? Okay. It'll take three attacks. It gets one bite, two claws. Hmm. It's going to go, I think I am going to maintain what I said. It's going to focus on Zareil because he's holding concentration.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:34 All right. I got 21 AC instead of 20 because it's a huger, a huger creature. Hmm. Hits. Both claws hit.
Dungeon Master 01:51:41 God damn it. I rolled at two, so it's a 13 on the bite. That is, okay, 24 with one claw. And that is a 26 on the second claw.
Dungeon Master 01:52:09 So you'll take in total, 29 points of slashing damage. It was 9 plus 6, so 15 on the first, and then 8 plus 6. So 14 on the second. So DC 10 on both.
Zariel Torgan 01:52:17 How much per each so I can half it for my concentration? Gotcha. Okay. All right. This is the first. It's got to be a 10.
Zariel Torgan 01:52:48 Okay, and this is the second. That workaster's working good.
Dungeon Master 01:52:52 Come on, number ones. Stupid. Okay. That's fine. After, uh, it's turn, Zario, it's your turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:10 all right i'm gonna bonus action uh nah i'll just go ahead and burn two of my um two of my wild shape abilities to turn into a fire elemental as i activate my embered main for the first time
Leopold Magnus 01:53:39 Oh cool.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:45 I'll slide a little to the left here. That way I don't burn anybody. And when a creature enters my space for the first time, they take 1D10 fire damage. So I'll roll there real quick. That's 7.
Cletus Cobbington 01:53:48 Sick burn.
Dungeon Master 01:54:03 Mm-hmm. You give him. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:22 That's just a little difference. All right. That's it. That's my whole turn.
Dungeon Master 01:54:31 At the end of your turn, it's going to burn two legendary actions. I need every creature within 10 feet. So that's Cyrus Fire Elemental Caledon, Leopold, and Giant ape to give me a dexterity saving throw. Failure.
Leopold Magnus 01:54:50 Ugh. Not very dexterous. Oh, tan. And then, did you say the Steel Defender? That guy got obliterated. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:54:55 Okay, I roll on with you right there. Critical failure. I should stay there. Just not. Who wants?
Zariel Torgan 01:54:57 one. That's two ones. That's two ones.
Cletus Cobbington 01:55:08 Guys, we're all so dexterous.
Dungeon Master 01:55:08 Yes. Okay, Cyrus failed, Caledon failed, Zaria failed, Leopold failed. And, yeah, okay, you all take 14 points of bludgeon damage.
Leopold Magnus 01:55:21 The steel defenders more districts than me. Jesus. The defender failed, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:55:40 And it's going to make things difficult. It's going to, because you are all knocked prone, fly straight up. So anybody who can, you can make a reaction opportunity attack with disadvantage. And it'll fly 40 feet straight in the air. Perfect. You are just knocked back five feet then.
Cletus Cobbington 01:55:57 Opportunity with disadvantage, you said.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:02 My guy can't be knocked prone. Okay. All right. Since I'm.
Dungeon Master 01:56:11 Not out of reach, but just barely. Yes. When you are knocked prone, you are no longer flanking somebody because you're looking on it. You took 14 points. And I'm pointing hits.
Leopold Magnus 01:56:18 Would that be a flat roll because we have advantage flanking? Oh, 20. That'll connect. Uh, what a weak roll? Uh, what a weak roll.
Cyrus Schwert 01:56:28 Did we take damage getting knocked from that deck save? Okay, thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:56:40 14 plus 9, 23.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:44 It didn't hit. So, Jonathan, I wouldn't get advantage since I'm not prone because everybody else is prone. Gotcha. All right, that makes sense. Just checking.
Leopold Magnus 01:56:46 Jeez, minimum damage, 8.
Dungeon Master 01:56:52 No, because everybody else is prone, yeah. Okay, and then start the round it is Cyrus, your turn. Half your movement, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:56:59 We're not to get engaged.
Cyrus Schwert 01:57:13 Okay. What is it to get up from prone? Like half movement? Okay. So I'll stand up, I guess. And I'll say, Cleetus, I don't know if you can hear. I don't know if you can hear me in the big ape body, but I want my all-the-powerers to work this time as possible. That would be sick. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:57:37 Oh. Well, first we got to make sure it hits. It has to hit it.
Cyrus Schwert 01:57:42 And I take a... It doesn't have to hit it. I see. I see. Shit. I wish I'd barriced myself.
Dungeon Master 01:57:42 And also you use your movement to get up. And also, you use your movement to get up. But again, it is 40 feet in the air.
Kaladen Shash 01:57:52 That's it, then you can make it a crit. I don't, they did not, they did not, they did not, they did not it. In the air.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:56 Hmm, oh no, oh no, oh no. Get safe. Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:58:11 So you're not in reaching to make a melee attack. So those didn't happen. You haven't burned it yet. Well, that is what it is. Hold on. It is actually there, and updates, health mostly.
Cyrus Schwert 01:58:12 Oh. Oh. Thank you. That makes sense for sure. I'm going to fucking look at it. That's really nice. I'm going to look at it. I'm going to cast fucking...
Cletus Cobbington 01:58:16 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:58:41 It's looking barely hurt. Okay. What is it? What does it see? And what does it do? And what does it do?
Cyrus Schwert 01:58:45 a chaos phantasmal killer on it, and it sees its own nightmare. I don't know what a nightmare of a dragon would be. Ice. And Articuno. And so it was, uh, I don't know, it just sees another dragon that's bigger than it. What could scare a dragon? It does a wisdom, wisdom saving throw.
Zariel Torgan 01:58:48 Nice. Puppies.
Kaladen Shash 01:59:08 That's pretty good. I got everyone in there. Fucking around.
Dungeon Master 01:59:16 It gets plus six to this because it is proficient. That is 11. It is going to use its legendary resistance. First one of the counter. So it succeeds. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:59:32 That just makes it save. Okay. So it still takes half of this, I suppose. So 23, 12. So I've got, I've done that.
Cletus Cobbington 01:59:36 Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:59:49 Let me take 12 points of damage. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:00:05 Okay, that'll do my turn. I'm going to save.
Kaladen Shash 02:00:10 40 feet.
Dungeon Master 02:00:15 At the end of your turn, it's too high to do any sort of legendary action economy. So it is just Leopold. 40 feet.
Leopold Magnus 02:00:23 and he's up in the air how high up did he go 40 feet um with that then i'm gonna use um use catapult at the third level um
Cletus Cobbington 02:00:33 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:00:49 Go for it. That is dirty 20.
Leopold Magnus 02:00:52 That's a deck save 16. What happens? Oh, shoot. Cannon Polk goes wide, but I have a bonus action and I will use a magic stone.
Leopold Magnus 02:01:17 Misses. And then bone crusher still just checking out the scene over here. 120 feet. He has the range, even though he's, yeah. He will cast firebolt. Oh, also misses. Yeah, that's my turn.
Kaladen Shash 02:01:19 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 02:01:28 Be able to hit, yeah. Working misses just goes wide over its head. Hey, Cletus, you're up. Go for it.
Cletus Cobbington 02:01:46 Alrighty. I'm gonna throw a rock at it. Come on. Oh, rolling slowly. 16. It rolled right off the 17. I'm gonna stomp my big eight foot. I suck as a monkey.
Dungeon Master 02:02:01 16 misses. You can drop polymorph if you don't want to be affected on it.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:05 Hmm. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Cletus Cobbington 02:02:13 Everyone else has done so much damage with them. I haven't hit one. Can I roll a depression check? I'm a sad, big monkey. Well, I already use my... I need the HP right now. I already use my... I don't think there's anything else I can... God damn it.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:18 This is your one chance. This is your one chance. Okay, it's 40, 40 feet in the air.
Cyrus Schwert 02:02:25 if you do it at eight miles. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:02:36 Okay. Caledon, you're going, man. Mm-hmm. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:41 Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Cletus Cobbington 02:02:44 We'll see a giant monkey tube. Oh, brutal.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:51 Let's house some fun. I'm going to cast a bonus action of Misty Step. So I'll 30 feet up into the air, Misty Step. And then I'm going to cast lightning lore, which will give me like another 15 feet of reach. I'm trying to like get it around like the crook of its wing or like its neck, something I could. I'm not going to be able to pull it down. I'm going to try to pull me up to it.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:15 Nice. Oh, damn.
Dungeon Master 02:03:21 Okay. Go for it. I like this. There's only a 15, but it's going to use its second legendary resistance.
Kaladen Shash 02:03:22 It's a, it's a strength. It's a strength save. So you're just like resisting me getting the whip on there. That's okay. All right. So then I just completely miss. I'm just going to fall 30 feet out of the air. Boom. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:03:33 Dragons are pretty strong. Thank you. Oh, Turtle.
Leopold Magnus 02:03:48 Oh no.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:48 Hmm. Ha, ha, ha.
Cletus Cobbington 02:03:49 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:03:52 Give me a deck save as you fall. You only take a D6 for every 10 feet after the first 10 feet. So you only take 2D6 damage and you take 6 points of falling damage. Oh, deck save a 27, you take half of that. You take three falling damage. Just three point land. The mud sploishes. Your knees only crack a tiny bit.
Kaladen Shash 02:04:12 Just three point like hero land impact crater. You said how much am I taken? Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:04:16 Riz, do something.
Dungeon Master 02:04:24 It is this stator group up next. You took three.
Cletus Cobbington 02:04:30 Saders. There's gonna shoot this fucker again. Come on, Rizzlers. Oh, fuck, I did damage first. No, this all going to hell. Fuck. I think one hit. What did they do? Plus five, yeah, one.
Kaladen Shash 02:04:47 I love that super rule three. One got it. For ten damage.
Cyrus Schwert 02:04:47 It's
Zariel Torgan 02:04:50 Nice.
Cletus Cobbington 02:05:03 One, two, six, but three. Okay, he's consistent. Riz is consistent. He does eight. Consistency is key. That's why I miss every fucking time. All right. I was going to have a move a little bit so we don't all just get hit by the same fucking thing. I think we have 30 feet or 40 feet, okay.
Dungeon Master 02:05:11 Okay. Mark, move. Okay. You move over there. He moves. Okay. He moves over there. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:05:41 At the end of their turn, after that, it is the adult black dragon. We'll see if it gets its breath weapon back. Ooh, that is a sticks.
Cletus Cobbington 02:05:51 Two, two, two.
Dungeon Master 02:05:58 It is in the air. And you guys, you don't even need to make an insight check on this one. You see it's like flying up and it's like every flex of its body muscle to sort of propel itself up. There is like little spurts of dark blood sort of shooting and like landing on the ground. This thing is gravely injured. It is going to fly this way. It's got.
Cletus Cobbington 02:06:26 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:06:29 When it gets to this point, it'll do its breath weapon, but then it's going to use, so that was 30 feet. It's got 50 more feet of fly speed, so it'll finish its turn off map as it's going to run after it does this attack. So that'll be a deck save from Giant Ape Cletus and Calidim.
Cletus Cobbington 02:07:01 What is my decks? Plus two. I'm just going to... Plus two to this. This is just abysmal monkey rolls are bad.
Dungeon Master 02:07:06 No, you're out. It's only a five-foot line, so it only can hit the ape and Caledon as it goes. Caledon, you'll take half damage. Cletus, you take full. So in your ape form, you take 69 points of acid damage, and Caledon, you'll take...
Zariel Torgan 02:07:16 Do I need to roll one as a fire monster? Nice.
Kaladen Shash 02:07:29 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:07:35 34. And it is off map to the southeast. Sorry.
Cletus Cobbington 02:07:37 69. Well, well.
Zariel Torgan 02:08:03 Assuming it only moved 80 feet, I have, if I use my action to dash, 100 feet of fly speed. I'd like to just get in its base to do the 1D10 of fire damage. I don't think I can keep up if it uses its legendary actions to go after that. But I'll do that real quick, just to see.
Dungeon Master 02:08:16 Mm-hmm. Yeah. So I'll just move it even technically farther. I'll put it at the edge of the map. It's 40 feet in the air and 50 feet out. I don't know what's the quick math on that.
Cletus Cobbington 02:08:36 Thanks.
Kaladen Shash 02:08:47 It's A squared B squared equal C squared. Let's play it in.
Dungeon Master 02:08:51 Yeah. Just give me the answer. It's 64 feet. So you do have that movement with 40 feet to spare.
Cletus Cobbington 02:09:06 I'm sorry.
Kaladen Shash 02:09:18 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:09:22 Um, you have, um, you rolled a 10. Fuck you. Opportunity attack. Yeah. It's not its turn. So we'll cycle through.
Zariel Torgan 02:09:28 Mm-hmm. And then if it wants to move out of my space, I think I also get a deck of opportunity, right? Do you want to do that now? Okay. Oh, gotcha. Okay. In case anybody else wants to do something.
Kaladen Shash 02:09:47 Yeah, it's not a certain. Yeah. Like a long range cop.
Dungeon Master 02:09:55 But at the end of your turn, it'll use its wing attack, two legendary actions. Give me a deck save. And if you fail, then it knocks you prone, technically, but you can't get knocked them back. Just a deck save. You are knocked back five feet, and you take 13 points of bludgeoning damage.
Cletus Cobbington 02:10:04 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:10:09 Okay. You say two deck saves? Oh, gotcha. I failed.
Kaladen Shash 02:10:18 No. Okay. Six feet away.
Dungeon Master 02:10:31 At the top, that is Cyrus. In the air.
Cyrus Schwert 02:10:38 What? Still in the air is on the ground. Okay. So we check the range on one thing, quick.
Cletus Cobbington 02:10:40 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:10:59 It's
Dungeon Master 02:11:01 Oh, and then, sorry, wing attack can use half its fly speed to keep going. It is 1004 feet away. That's my bad. Yeah. Just a little bit.
Kaladen Shash 02:11:11 104 people. Roger Regner.
Cyrus Schwert 02:11:15 Okay. I'm going to get closer to it. Move my movement towards it. And then I'm going to cast phantasmal killer on it again. So another wisdom saving throw, and it sees an even fucking bigger dragons.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:40 Hmm, mm-hmm, mm.
Dungeon Master 02:11:42 With them save. That is a natural 20. Yeah, that'll do it. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 02:11:44 Ha ha ha.
Cyrus Schwert 02:11:46 yeah that'll do it so it takes half again and it doesn't do anything cool 23 so the same thing 12 more
Kaladen Shash 02:11:51 Ooh. It's just barely.
Dungeon Master 02:12:15 Okay. Leopold. Oh, keep going. Okay. Here, if I put you all relatively where you were there, there, there.
Cyrus Schwert 02:12:17 And then, yeah, that'll do it. No, I don't have anything else. We're good. Let's see them on the map.
Cletus Cobbington 02:12:25 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:12:48 Okay. That puts it 40 feet from there and like 100 feet from you guys. Roughly distance. Ready, Rex. What are you doing?
Leopold Magnus 02:13:11 I'm gonna fuck this thing up. I'm gonna cast, uh, why is my map all fucky? I'm gonna cast a hideous laughter on it. Yeah, that's when I need to figure out because this dragon is not. There it is on my screen now. 104 feet, okay, let's see.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:14 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:13:14 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 02:13:26 What's the range on that? The dragon is 104 feet from you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:13:41 It's 104 days of time vacations.
Leopold Magnus 02:13:42 I feel like the range is pretty good. Hideous laughter. God damn it, 30 feet. All right, not going to work. Just a little shy. Yeah, let's see, with 104 feet, I don't know how much. I think I can do is firebolt.
Dungeon Master 02:13:56 Just a little shot. The kind of the goal was to run away. Jesse's just dragging this out. We'll let my guys escape.
Zariel Torgan 02:14:16 Ha ha ha ha ha. 60, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:14:19 All right, at that distance, I can throw a firebolt. And I can also, what's the stones range? Oh, that's 60 feet. So I can do a firebolt. Yeah. Fuck's sake, can't hit anything. So that doesn't connect. But bonus action.
Cletus Cobbington 02:14:36 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 02:14:40 Misses. Boncrest rule. Mm-hmm. Go ahead and roll. 23 hits.
Leopold Magnus 02:14:47 um can't hit with that range i'll just not do a bonus action but uh my steel defender will be able to shoot one there you go finally yep let's go 10 damage on that firebolt
Zariel Torgan 02:15:05 Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:15:15 Okay. Caledan. It is, I mean, it's far away from you at this point, but you can tell you, those last hits are like, the wing is, oh, it's Cletus, that's right. Phone pressure took your thought.
Cletus Cobbington 02:15:17 Hey. You can continue. It's wing as her, you said. Hey.
Cyrus Schwert 02:15:21 Sam it.
Leopold Magnus 02:15:22 That's my turn.
Kaladen Shash 02:15:35 Yeah. Do you scale? Come on, clean this time. How far can you throw stone?
Dungeon Master 02:15:41 its wing is not beating in sync with the other one. It's sort of stumbling in the air. Go for it. Go for it.
Cletus Cobbington 02:15:49 I'm gonna hit it this time, okay? I understand why you wanted to skip me. I'm gonna move a little bit, another, or my full thing, so I can get within a hundred feet so I can huck another rock. Come on. Let's see. I have a plus nine, please! Not please!
Zariel Torgan 02:15:52 Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Cyrus Schwert 02:16:09 I'm just kidding. For the love of God. Oh, go. Oh, go. Oh, wow. Let's be a word. Oh, wow.
Dungeon Master 02:16:12 Come on. Be so, so epic. Oh, shit. With 2 HP, describe how you kill it.
Kaladen Shash 02:16:20 Just, just rips us. Go ahead and roll that damage. It's huge damage. It explodes.
Leopold Magnus 02:16:20 Ah, this.
Cletus Cobbington 02:16:21 Fuck you. So that's the 14. That's 14. No, I want to roll this 14 thesis. That's a lot of dice. That's a lot of dice.
Zariel Torgan 02:16:22 Absolutely.
Cyrus Schwert 02:16:38 with a bolder.
Kaladen Shash 02:16:49 That's 14 DC. Yeah, there it goes, there it goes.
Leopold Magnus 02:16:49 Monkey see, monkey do.
Cletus Cobbington 02:16:51 Computing. Wait, one dice is stuck in the corner, unable to roll. Okay. Forty six. Ah! And just... In a ball of fury, the Rizzlers hop on a boulder, and I just send it and they just gritty on the boulder.
Dungeon Master 02:16:59 You did 46 points of damage. How does the giant ape Hucka Rock in kill this dragon?
Cletus Cobbington 02:17:18 I'm smacking it poof into ash when they hit it into Rizland. They sing a little jig. Okay, maybe they don't gritty. They sing a song while they're just pulling on for fear in life.
Dungeon Master 02:17:34 This raucous hurtling through the air. And as it passes over the head of Fire Elemental Jesse, he hears like some pan flute music just layering like a petty-wop speaker level of distortion as it soars by. And you see it doesn't just like hit the other wing of the dragon snapping it. The dragon spins at that point.
Zariel Torgan 02:17:42 I...
Leopold Magnus 02:17:47 Jesus.
Cyrus Schwert 02:17:48 Thank you. Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:18:02 Hell yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:18:04 out of control it can't see itself there's this huge sort of jutting jagged broken like tree that had fallen down and it just spheres itself through that cutting like from neck through the back of the torso like above where the tail comes out it just skewers the ground starts melting as it blood sort of pours out melting everything below it it like after the tree starts to melt just like
Kaladen Shash 02:18:12 out.
Dungeon Master 02:18:31 hits the ground everything sort of erodes and falls and the dragon just keeps sort of tumbling and rolling it hitting the ground and eventually it goes to rest in like a somewhat shallow deep pool it'd be like knee deep for you guys but it's formed just sort of sits uh and it is unmoving and um
Zariel Torgan 02:18:50 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:18:54 Well,
Leopold Magnus 02:18:56 Boy, we fucked that thing up.
Cyrus Schwert 02:18:59 I was fighting hay bales like two weeks ago.
Dungeon Master 02:18:59 You will all level up after a long breath, but I'm going to say the giant ape form drops. And Cletus, you level up to level nine as everybody sees sort of the ape form drop. And you have like this, I mean, like, think of it as like anime aura. You just start like emanating this like.
Dungeon Master 02:19:21 Whisping smoke is like your muscles bulge a little bit. You get a little bit straighter back for just a moment and then you get back to your normal hunt. No, no, you level up. You hit full HP. You get video game level up.
Zariel Torgan 02:19:28 Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 02:19:30 And then I pass out because I'm at 7 HP. Holy shit. Let's go.
Cyrus Schwert 02:19:40 video game rules.
Kaladen Shash 02:19:42 They're going to go.
Leopold Magnus 02:19:46 Jonathan, is there a way I could harvest maybe some of this dragon skin as materials? Hey, you know, what's the point of killing these creatures if we can't steal their fucking materials? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:19:52 Rick, you are relentless. Yes, you can. Just instantly. Give me a survival check. You want to harvest some hide specifically, like scale? Okay. If somebody, okay, you get to add two to your role?
Zariel Torgan 02:20:10 I'll give him a hand. I'll also, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, give me some light, and I'll start carving away.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:17 All right, well, I'll negotiate with Zario. I'll ask him maybe, since his knife is a little more precise, if he could extract it and I could give him a hand. Nice, 23.
Dungeon Master 02:20:32 Okay, just so you can make it and add two to your role. 23. Yeah, you get, I'll say, um, I don't like, we'll say there was like a lot of damaged hide here and there, but you cut out like a solid,
Zariel Torgan 02:20:35 Okay, oops. All right, I accidentally already rolled that, so I'll just add two to that, I guess. So 20, 23. Damn.
Dungeon Master 02:20:57 two foot by like six foot stretch of un like gashed up dragon hide little bit of like fatty tissue below it but mostly scale enough to make any single set of armor piece or if you made like gauntlets and boots so you could do gotlets and boots leggings or chest piece or maybe boots and helmet or gauntlets and helmet like any kind of combination like that but not two large pieces
Leopold Magnus 02:21:06 Wait. All right. Basically, one full set armor of dragon. Oh, pancer jet.
Zariel Torgan 02:21:21 Nice. So basically the full thing. So, two steps.
Dungeon Master 02:21:30 No. You can do like, yeah, like, uh, yeah. Sorry. Two small things are one big thing. Same thing.
Kaladen Shash 02:21:31 No, pants or chest, helmet, or gloves or boot combo. So like the whole thing, right, man?
Cletus Cobbington 02:21:39 Actually, the offer. Can you grab a tooth for me? I want to remember that.
Leopold Magnus 02:21:40 Basically the full set. If you take all of those.
Zariel Torgan 02:21:52 Yeah, do you want me to roll again through a tooth? Okay. 13.
Dungeon Master 02:21:56 rule your survival and add two, because I'm sure you'd still get some sort of help out of this. 13. I'll say...
Cletus Cobbington 02:22:10 How about some druidic help advantage here?
Kaladen Shash 02:22:16 Is it plus or plus two?
Dungeon Master 02:22:16 You guys are newer to this. So I'll explain the rules again. They kind of burned the hell out of the get advantage thing really earlier on the campaign. So we did a homebrew rule where if you want to give somebody help on a check like harvesting stuff or looking around dungeons, things like that, it is their role. And then any single person who helps adds two.
Dungeon Master 02:22:42 So in theory, if all of you wanted to help, you could add two, four, six, eight to it kind of deal. But for every one person that helps, you just add two. Okay. So 13 goes to 15. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:22:47 I will also, I'll also assist. I'll just, I'll just give him bad advice over his shoulder. So he just is like, okay, that's not helpful. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:22:53 Gotcha. That's right. Just tug it. Just tug it. Just tug it real hard.
Leopold Magnus 02:22:53 I'll help out. I'm holding on that light, you know, give them a little bit extra.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:58 Anybody want to give me a hand with this? Can't get this tooth off. Mm-hmm. Backseat dentistry. I'm pulling. I'm pulling. That's what I'm doing. All right.
Dungeon Master 02:23:10 You can roll it again, and you'll get your bonus. 18. You get... You get... You get... ...three... ...three... ...you get... ...three... ...full dragon things.
Zariel Torgan 02:23:25 Okay, so that's 12 plus 6, so 18. Nice.
Cletus Cobbington 02:23:27 Oh shit. Oh shit. I just want one. You can have the others if you need it for something. Maybe it's a, it can have a chew toy for your little pups. Bones.
Kaladen Shash 02:23:27 14. Excellent.
Zariel Torgan 02:23:53 Maybe. Yeah. Leo, you need these teeth for anything? The size of him. All right. All right.
Kaladen Shash 02:23:57 Yes. Yes.
Leopold Magnus 02:23:58 Oh, well, I'm always happy to pocket them, but did you get enough, Cletus? Well, I'm sure there's something these will be useful for. I can throw them in my inventory. Two dragon teeth?
Cletus Cobbington 02:24:05 I just want the one. I'm going to make a sick-ass sword for Chip. I'm going to see if I can fit two in his mouth and give him massive bangs. No, it's fine. Jesus, okay. I'll take two. That works for me.
Dungeon Master 02:24:12 Okay. Well, now it seems like three to one, you get one dragon two.
Zariel Torgan 02:24:22 Like a mammoth task.
Leopold Magnus 02:24:28 One dragon. One dragon tooth.
Dungeon Master 02:24:42 Okay. Battered and bruised guys are pretty tired after that. Actually, you're mostly doing fine, but not an easy fight for sure. You guys waft the hell out of that. I even had buffed it pre-combat. And then I removed layer actions because I was like, this is going to be a hard fight without that.
Cletus Cobbington 02:25:00 It did not feel like it. Well, the payment was being hooked up and missing everything until the end.
Dungeon Master 02:25:13 And wish I hadn't. That sucked. Okay. It is... Yeah. Late in the day, the track, the fight, the harvesting, all of that took quite a bit of time. You have the option of to keep moving. You can do...
Zariel Torgan 02:25:16 Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 02:25:16 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:25:32 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:25:39 like another encounter survival check to see if you guys want to set up for next time or you can sort of bed down and rest for the night and call it somewhat early with a little bit of like camp fire stuff
Cyrus Schwert 02:25:55 Um, if we can heal up, well, if Cetus level up, I guess. Like, we can go another time. We can feel some. We got dealers. Don't you think? There's a lot of people. There's a lot of dealers in the party, too.
Cletus Cobbington 02:26:05 I'm feeling chipper. Yeah. I can, I can just heal. I'll heal someone. I'll heal.
Kaladen Shash 02:26:14 Yeah, I mean, if we just take a short rest, I can roll a few dice. We can go further and then long rest. That's fine. I mean, if we're going to, we do a short rest, take a whole hour, John.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:14 Yeah. Yeah. Aim here. Yeah, I'm good. Short rest.
Leopold Magnus 02:26:25 Yeah. I was going to say, I didn't didn't even take a hit. Um, I guess if we're, go ahead. It would be pretty late by the time we finish a short rest.
Cyrus Schwert 02:26:29 I'm not doing sports. Probably.
Dungeon Master 02:26:33 Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:26:44 I mean, if you, right, sorry me. Okay, let us heal. Good. There should be good.
Cletus Cobbington 02:26:46 I'll just, I'll just heal. Let's not waste too much time. I'll just do a, send a third level healing word your way, Callagin. 22 heals to you.
Zariel Torgan 02:27:00 I'll do a second level healing spirit. So I have 6D6 healing to spread out. So I'm gonna take three of them. Nice.
Leopold Magnus 02:27:09 Let's see how much.
Cyrus Schwert 02:27:19 I'm going to do a second level on myself. He'll have ordered. Probably not. Well, he just leveled up and healed like 70 health. I don't know. I don't know.
Cletus Cobbington 02:27:23 Since Cyrus has bonded with me, I went up to full. Does he mirror my region there? Probably not. Okay. I feel like maybe it should be actual heel spells.
Dungeon Master 02:27:32 Yeah, he heals the amount that you heal if he's not. Yeah. Health points resetting and health points healing, not the same.
Zariel Torgan 02:27:43 Yeah. Caledon, are you at 56? Is that where you're at? I got three more D6s if you want to take like a couple of them.
Leopold Magnus 02:27:44 Oh yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:27:44 Very important. I'm at 56. Yeah, pretty good. It'll be good for the rest of the day. Is anybody else need those or, do you need more? You can get higher.
Cyrus Schwert 02:27:51 That feels a little weird. Okay. I heal my 12 for 50.
Leopold Magnus 02:28:13 I also have, I could give out three D6s with this glutton's fork.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:13 I could get, like, another 15. Oh, shit. Well, Callen, do you want to take three, and I'll take three? Ten.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:26 Right, I'll roll one more D6. I know. Didn't do good. Sorry, it's 62. 62. Like, what else can we possibly see? We're rolling so well. It's going to smooth sailing all the way to clear. Yeah, both got used. Appreciate it.
Dungeon Master 02:28:28 You guys.
Cyrus Schwert 02:28:31 Well, better than that.
Leopold Magnus 02:28:48 So did you guys use it all up? Because I had three to give out. So. Cool.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:49 Oh yeah. Yeah. We're all set. Let's do it. Is it back to the beginning?
Kaladen Shash 02:28:59 Bye, bye.
Dungeon Master 02:29:06 yeah so everybody's rolled so far so this will be like the last leg of the night sun is setting you can get a couple hours before you have to set up camp but luckily setting up camp is very easy for you guys you plant the staff get the dome open up the workshop and you have your camp ready to go so you guys can sort of push it a little bit longer somebody give me a survival and somebody give me an encounter
Cletus Cobbington 02:29:07 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:29:39 Did anybody not doing an encounter yet? I did last and that did not go well. It's back to you for survival.
Leopold Magnus 02:29:45 Uh.
Kaladen Shash 02:29:46 I did a survival. I don't know if I've done an encounter yet. Yeah, cruising.
Zariel Torgan 02:29:52 Has anybody not rolled the survival? Because it might be back to the top. OK, so I started off. So I'll roll the survival real quick. 17? That's all perspective.
Cyrus Schwert 02:29:58 I think we are back with all. Please, for the Lord God. Better. Better than the two not ones. There's somebody.
Dungeon Master 02:29:58 I think it is. Okay, and then give me an encounter check.
Cletus Cobbington 02:30:15 Let's just say it's back to top, back to Cyrus. That's fine, that's fine. I don't... Two more dragon. Watch is going to be a Nat 20.
Kaladen Shash 02:30:21 All right, all that. I just rolled it, sorry. I don't think we want that one. It's huge. It's huge, so much. That's huge. It's huge, so much better.
Cyrus Schwert 02:30:26 I should win. Jonathan, are we meant to do me. Well,
Zariel Torgan 02:30:36 So funny. The one. T-rex and a dragon. T-rex and a dragon.
Dungeon Master 02:30:39 Go ahead and roll. See what it is. Do you want friends number or Travis's number? They're both something different. But I will let you pick which one you want.
Leopold Magnus 02:30:49 Jesus Christ.
Cletus Cobbington 02:30:50 Flip a. Flip a coin.
Kaladen Shash 02:30:55 That's at least an entire tier better than three. Yeah. We can go with, John. Oh, rollies, that's better. You ready?
Cyrus Schwert 02:31:11 Rock, Paper, Scissors? Rock. We keep... He already did it. I got scissors, things.
Zariel Torgan 02:31:15 Roll leaf. Oh, you can do our favorite scissors. That works.
Dungeon Master 02:31:18 I think they want rock, paper, scissors. 15. You're going with the five instead. And this is perfect because of the way it works out.
Kaladen Shash 02:31:25 One, two, three, three, three, three, go see that.
Cletus Cobbington 02:31:28 Oh, Jesus.
Cyrus Schwert 02:31:39 me and Caledon are arguing on which way to go. It's over here, dude.
Dungeon Master 02:31:46 Okay. You guys travel, your survival check was good. You make a day's, you shave off a day's progress with that. So you had seven days, the end of the day goes to six, and because you had a good rule, you cut it to five. So you guys have five days of travel left to the dome. Those are unfortunate setbacks earlier. And as you guys are setting up camp,
Zariel Torgan 02:31:56 Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:32:13 We'll get to what the result of the encounter trick was later. But what do you guys do as you are betting down for the night?
Zariel Torgan 02:32:25 I'll train the pups. I'll train them on hide. I'm going to have a little flash of, like, magic, and I want them to practice, like, tucking behind something real fast so they don't get, like, murked by the first AOE thing. Okay, so this plus two.
Dungeon Master 02:32:43 Okay, give me an animal hunting chicken. You get advantage. Oh, sorry, you get the plus two from Leopold from what he did early. Early on. 15, 17. Pretty good role. New command, but they seem to be grasping it. You've made up the sort of setback you had before. They're less hesitant.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:54 It's not just rolling. I'm not sure way. It's not just rolling when I click. Oh. So 17. Gotcha. Sweet. All right, that's all I got.
Dungeon Master 02:33:13 And they seem to be grasping the basics of the command. Okay. Anybody else? Yeah, go for it. Mm-hmm.
Kaladen Shash 02:33:25 Yeah, can I put some hours in on the ring or attempt to? It was Arcana. Just not going, well. I shouldn't roll any D20s right now. I haven't rolled over five in a minute. It just explodes right in my face again.
Dungeon Master 02:33:43 Dude. Um, roll me a D6. Four.
Leopold Magnus 02:33:47 And, oh, geez.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:48 Oh, man. Three D. Rexes.
Cyrus Schwert 02:33:51 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:33:55 It spawns a dragon.
Dungeon Master 02:34:06 This one is not super impactful because of how everything goes, the strain on your eyes that led you to the failure is painful and you start to lose sight of the world around you. You are blinded until you finish a long rest. But since you're about to go finish a long rest, it's minimal. It's extreme but minimal.
Kaladen Shash 02:34:19 Oh, super. Super. Yeah. Was the natural one. It's okay. I just played off nonchral. Okay, guys, I'm going to go to bed.
Zariel Torgan 02:34:19 Damn.
Leopold Magnus 02:34:20 Jesus. Yeah, good thing that wasn't first thing in the morning. Your eyes are just fried.
Cyrus Schwert 02:34:38 Cyrus reached out from the sound. What was that bang? That was a really big sound.
Dungeon Master 02:34:44 Ha ha ha ha ha.
Cletus Cobbington 02:34:48 You lay down for sleep, but your eyes are wide open.
Zariel Torgan 02:34:52 Ha ha ha ha.
Kaladen Shash 02:34:56 There's no islands.
Leopold Magnus 02:35:00 Jonathan, can I work on my steel defender and try to integrate the dragon hide into the armor plate I'm working? Mm-hmm. Oh, well, I'll just stick with what I've got going on then right now, and then I'll iterate later.
Dungeon Master 02:35:12 Um, yeah, that'll be something completely new from what you were doing. Um, do you want to pivot to that? Okay. If you succeed wildly, I'll say you'll finish the Phoenix feather thing and then you'll start on the dragon hide.
Leopold Magnus 02:35:36 Got it. 25.
Dungeon Master 02:35:42 That's a good rule. I'll build it out
Dungeon Master 02:35:47 Later, I didn't plan on everything going this way. The Phoenix Feather integration goes well, and you can tell that it has an innate fire resistance now. It won't melt. The like its base form seems to repel excessive heat. So you have just whatever to your still defender, fire resistance is now one of its abilities. And then what do you want to do with the dragon hide? What is the intent?
Cletus Cobbington 02:36:03 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:36:17 Yeah, I was going to try to maybe work it into the breastplate, you know, kind of the chest piece of the steel defender, integrating it. I'm trying to improve its armor class.
Dungeon Master 02:36:28 With the goal of what? Okay. We'll say you've made progress towards that. I'll track that. Okay. Anything else from anybody else? Good progress from Leopold, though.
Leopold Magnus 02:36:55 Okay, for the, I guess, record, how many hours do you think I have towards that armor?
Cletus Cobbington 02:36:57 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:37:02 I don't mean, I have to figure it out. We'll say that this is like the equivalent of giving yourself like the equivalent of like a first or second level spell. So same thing as before I was thinking like absorb elements or like a resistance type of spell, which are pretty low. So it'll be like the standard 32 hours, but that was a successful check. So depending on how many hours you're putting in,
Dungeon Master 02:37:30 You only have three left to make and however many hours. So what do you want to dedicate to it before you go to sleep? Okay, we'll say, okay, well, so you get like six hours and do it? So we're at...
Cletus Cobbington 02:37:39 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:37:40 I think I only need six hours of sleep, so I'll just stay up fairly late working on it. Like, I don't know, midnight later.
Dungeon Master 02:38:01 26 left. You were standing next to Caledon while he's working on his ring. So, like, you're making really good progress. And then at one point, Caledon just sort of blows up backwards, hits the wall, and then, like, hair singed, eyes wide open, just goes, I'm going to bed. And he just, like, walks away. And you keep working.
Leopold Magnus 02:38:19 I don't even look up. I don't even notice it happened. I'm so dialed.
Cletus Cobbington 02:38:26 Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:38:30 Yeah, you're in the zone. With all of that, who will it be? I'm going to say, Bren and Jesse, high or low?
Zariel Torgan 02:38:55 I'll do high, I guess. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:38:58 Take it low. Go for it. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:39:00 Okay. Let's have a roll off. Oh, somebody roll at you 20. Not both. 18. Jesse, you were high? Okay. Everybody's going to sleep for the night. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:39:16 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:39:26 and shutting down, they're done with their sort of experiments. It's very late. Everybody's fatigued. You don't technically need to sleep, but as you're hitting this sort of stasis,
Cletus Cobbington 02:39:40 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:39:41 You have what you used to feel like was dreaming before you realize that you don't actually sleep. Your mind sort of goes and you slip into darkness and you start reliving another forgotten memory, something that hasn't happened to you for a while. But you find yourself...
Zariel Torgan 02:39:54 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:40:05 In pitch blackness, there's nothing in front of you. You realize your sensors are kind of coming online and you have like a little bit of night vision that kicks on inherently. Your eyes open and you were standing in a very small closed door, like a little cabinet closet space and you're just behind the door. You realize in this moment that you are waiting to be summoned, the same as each day begins for you.
Dungeon Master 02:40:32 You hear a dull light footsteps from down a distant hallway moving with a good pace. Eventually, with a loud burst, you hear your master, or rather, who you think is your master, storm into the room, muttering to himself under his breath, just expressing his frustration, something that happens often now. You see, you sort of push the door open. You know you're supposed to wait to be called, but the longer you've been...
Cletus Cobbington 02:40:41 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:41:01 created awake the more you sort of find yourself thinking for yourself so even though you're not commanded to you sort of prop the door open and you see he's moving with unmatched grace even amongst high elves he is elegant smooth moving he just basically glides from one room to the to the one edge of the room to the other side he with a flick of his wrist
Zariel Torgan 02:41:19 Mm.
Dungeon Master 02:41:28 points out at different parts of like the glass pane that overlooks the city and each one of them sort of frost and you see like not rudimentary but old style runes project up images on each of these windows um each one of them has a different thing some of them are rotating and spinning and you see he sort of expands and contracts um
Cletus Cobbington 02:41:28 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:41:55 He signals to the door behind him. You see invisibly waving a hand and the door slides open. And with just a flick of his wrist, you hear him say, zero to my side, if you will. Zero being your ID, your call. What do you do?
Cletus Cobbington 02:42:07 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:10 Do I feel compelled to move out like that's what feels like the right thing to do? Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:42:16 Oh, kind of like to train.
Dungeon Master 02:42:23 You feel as though you should follow the commands. But there is, you realize that you have the ability to not. Yeah. You step out.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:33 Hmm. I'll come out and just to see if I get a better view of everything out there and kind of just walk up behind. Do I look and feel normal?
Dungeon Master 02:42:49 looking side to side a very clean room mostly white and off white lots of very nice books all matched tomes of like black with gold accents and filigree like uniform like he's had each one rebound to match the same style he wears these flowing blue robes and cloaks he's got um
Cletus Cobbington 02:43:04 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:43:14 like shoulder length curly orange hair, bright, very fair face. You know this is the person you've seen multiple times before. You move through this space to his side, overlooking the city. And again, you don't know where this is yet. You haven't put that together. You don't have the memory, but as you're looking out this window to describe it for everybody else, think of these...
Dungeon Master 02:43:41 like circular platforms with like buildings and part of the city built onto them set into like the side of a cliff and they're all connected by either like really nice bleak bridges or you see teleportation circles all over the place and people just moving back and forth through the city a very
Zariel Torgan 02:43:58 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:44:02 high technology location. And this guy continues in front of you. And he goes, take this down exactly. I am sending word to Lord Marshall Loriv. He is to tend to city affairs while I seek somebody out. You see, he doesn't quite look to you. He never looks to you, but he sort of looks towards your direction over his shoulder. He goes,
Dungeon Master 02:44:30 You are to tend to my personal matters as usual. And if anybody inquires, tell them I'm visiting Lord Kalmara in Philantera. He's checked it out multiple times that I go see what he is doing. He's made some advances in automaton research, and he's requesting my aid as obviously...
Cletus Cobbington 02:44:35 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:44:53 With your success and the rest of my soldiers, I tend to be the best. And then he does look at you and you see he's got burning blue eyes. They're so vibrant, weird contrast to his hair. And he goes, under no circumstances are you to reveal that I am outside of the dome? Is that understood?
Zariel Torgan 02:45:16 I'll just give a polite nod. Do I get the vibe that we're semi-close, or do I get the vibe that he doesn't care about me at all, just based on his body language? Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:45:29 it's weird again you don't have these memories like fully figured out but in this moment you know that you are just a robot he has called you robot before but you feel as though you are like his go-to guy every time he asked you a question not ask you a question every task he needs you're a part of
Dungeon Master 02:45:55 And as with your previous memories you've unlocked, like when he has been doing research on the energy core that looked similar to the one that you had found below your city, you're always there. He doesn't always address you, but he'll send you on tasks all the time. And with your name, Zero, you know that you are like the first. You are...
Zariel Torgan 02:45:55 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:46:19 Not some number. You're like close circle kind of creation. You know he has other automatones that are also fairly trusted, but like he just told you, he is leaving the dome something people don't do, and he is disclosing to you that that is what he's doing. He continues, you are dismissed. As you leave the room, what do you do?
Zariel Torgan 02:46:37 Gotcha. OK. I assume I don't get back into the closet. I get to go outside.
Cletus Cobbington 02:46:49 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:46:55 No, not unless you want to be in the closet. Okay. Yeah. You leave the room and the door is very quietly just shut behind you, almost like,
Zariel Torgan 02:46:58 No, no, no, he's out. I guess I'll walk out in the hallway. I want to survey everything I possibly can, just get in as much information, you know, see what I can see. Is it just an open hallway right outside the door?
Dungeon Master 02:47:23 They're like drawn together magnetically. There's a little bit of resonance as they close. You are walking across like a white floor platform suspended in the air and it's an entire like glass enclosed walkway as you walk from his office to the main section of the building. I'm going to say no, it's empty for now.
Cletus Cobbington 02:47:27 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:47:37 Is there another person anywhere near me?
Zariel Torgan 02:47:53 Gotcha. Okay. I want to make my way towards anything of note. Like if there seems to be like a pavilion or some sort of like grand entry or something that's going to have some sort of description of the building or a possible, you know, butler guy or something, I want to get something here, hopefully.
Dungeon Master 02:48:15 Yeah, you walk down to the building. You take like an elevator equivalent. It's like this platform that sits on like fixed run sets and it just lowers you quietly to the ground. And once you hit the ground, there are a ton of people moving around. And you just innately know that this is the building of the High Council.
Cletus Cobbington 02:48:38 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:48:39 Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm.
Dungeon Master 02:48:39 You don't know how you know that, but you know that. You see stationed at every doorway is an automaton that looks very similar to you. Like you describe yourself as being more like Ultron from the movies in your current form. They're like, are regular ones that look like that. Very unmoving. They don't carry the emotion that you seem to have developed, but you know that they are designed after you. And as you're moving through this space, would you like to do anything?
Zariel Torgan 02:49:08 I want to walk up to one of them because I imagine I'm semi-superior. And under the guise of, like, testing it, I'm going to ask it some questions. I'm going to say, unit, subsequent unit, I guess I have an accent, huh? Subsequent unit. What would be the year that we're in right now?
Dungeon Master 02:49:32 You see, it looks to you, cocks its head a little curiously and goes, let me figure out what year I want to actually make it. It's going to be canon after this. No, it looks at you and it goes very gently and with a slight nod. It goes, Commander Zero. It is the year 222.
Cletus Cobbington 02:49:43 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:44 If you want, I can ask other questions while you're thinking about that. Interesting. And what are we thinking it is for us? Jesus Christ.
Dungeon Master 02:50:07 I think I have it as like a thousand something.
Cletus Cobbington 02:50:14 Damn, you're old.
Zariel Torgan 02:50:15 Yeah, okay. All right. Yeah, that tracks. That's a good answer. And where are we at specifically right now, which dome? Okay, gotcha.
Cyrus Schwert 02:50:20 I don't know.
Dungeon Master 02:50:32 Oh, good question. It is the year 1099, currently. That's what I established as. Okay. It looks, again, almost talking its head curiously, and it goes, we are in Emerald District of Philanthra.
Zariel Torgan 02:50:59 Interesting. Oops. I don't know why I did that. I just bumped the mouse. I just so many natural 20s. All right. Interesting. And God damn. All right. Testing the bounds of this dream, I'm just going to cast...
Dungeon Master 02:51:07 You're really perceptive.
Zariel Torgan 02:51:26 I'm going to see if I cast a spell. I'm going to cast polymorph. And I'm going to turn this guy into a giant ape. Does that work? I put my hand back down.
Cyrus Schwert 02:51:30 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:51:38 You raise your hand and find that you do not have any druidic powers. You are just... You fade. Having tried to initiate something that did not happen at that time, there's like a sort of...
Zariel Torgan 02:51:57 Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:52:06 I don't know, like it is molding the perception of reality. It is distorting what actually happened. There's a crossover of your current thoughts trying to fan through this memory and you can't hold on to it anymore. And you fade into darkness, losing grasp on this sort of free-floating memory piece that's just been in your subconscious. And...
Cletus Cobbington 02:52:26 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:52:34 your dream ends. Bran and Travis. Who wants to be high? Who wants to be low? All righty. That is 19. Cyrus. Cyrus, you also have a dream that night.
Kaladen Shash 02:52:43 I'll go low again.
Cyrus Schwert 02:52:48 Right. 35.
Dungeon Master 02:53:06 You are, how old did you decide Cyrus actually was currently? 35. This is when you are like in your actual teens. Let me find my list. Okay. You are 16 years old.
Dungeon Master 02:53:37 You are attending lecture at your, there's not like primary and secondary and post-educations like in like how we have reference to. You just have like an educational house that you attend lectures at in like the curriculum that is being paid for by your family. So it's sort of elective based, but you pick it ahead of time.
Cyrus Schwert 02:53:38 This is 16 summer.
Dungeon Master 02:54:06 You are heading to like an art history lecture. And what does Cyrus look and dress like when he's in school?
Cyrus Schwert 02:54:19 Double polo Ken from Barbie style. No, I'm just kidding. Oh, God. I basically look the same now. I look a little ratty compared to the people around. But like, you can tell that they were nice clothes. They've just been worn out and like refused to gotten rid of, basically.
Zariel Torgan 02:54:26 Bye.
Cyrus Schwert 02:54:49 And my hair's just a little spikeier, a lot more gel, some odor lines coming off as teens do. Yeah, I guess, yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:55:04 Nice. You're just in a passing hallway. As you're walking, the class is boring. You kind of have a pretty easy grasp on this stuff, but it's not what you really enjoy, so you just never want to go to it. But you're walking in the class and passing you coming from that lecture is one of your closer friends. He's like a fellow half elf descendant.
Cletus Cobbington 02:55:28 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 02:55:33 uh like just boy fair looks curly short brown hair that sticks to his head only the slightest of points to his ears as his blood is pretty muted out as far as like in duven goes he just still have some elven features um it's your friend erin er yn his full name is erin door but he goes by erin um
Dungeon Master 02:55:57 He wears his backpack by only one strap, of course. And you see he's got very nice clothes.
Dungeon Master 02:56:05 But in very similar open defiance, he just has painted a huge X across his chest to sort of go against the norms that have been set for him. He's very like just alt punk kind of deal. He walks kind of like a swagger. But you and him are pretty tight. And he sort of shoots you a nod.
Cletus Cobbington 02:56:09 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:56:28 And this is something you had planned on earlier that day, but as you pass, he sort of just hands off a book to you underneath, sort of like his other actual studies. It just drops you a book as you pass by. And you know that what he's handed you is just like a recovered book from the library discussing expedition out of the dome. These are not factual tales, but they're like historical retellings of,
Dungeon Master 02:56:58 famed adventurers that used to leave the dome in early dome culture like wait like in the years like one two three and four post dome construction when like travel outside of the dome was still allowed and it wasn't too dangerous yet um you like your plan at this point is is when you get to class you're going to pretend like you're reading your textbook and just start reading these stories
Cletus Cobbington 02:57:00 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:57:26 But that's, you pass by, you shoots you a nod, and you just go your separate ways. And as you hit in class and you're reading about this book, go ahead and give me a history check as you're reading. Ten.
Cyrus Schwert 02:57:44 Okay. Beth.
Cletus Cobbington 02:57:49 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:57:55 You just don't get the good, good stuff. You are reading about these heroes when they discovered what was called the Ashen Grove.
Dungeon Master 02:58:08 This location in the far north of the continent. The strongest mages and fighters historically were always in Philanatra. It's the most arcane-influenced dome. And of all of the high councils and the first council, which are like the number one mages who run the city, the strongest of them was in philantra. Sorry, not philentra, isoptera.
Dungeon Master 02:58:36 That is where... Sorry. And then, Jesse, I told you Philantera. You would have been told Esoptera. I had that backwards. You're from... It was from the West Stone that you had that memory. And so... Sorry, that throws off everything. But that is what it should have said. So, Cyrus, you read that Isopra...
Zariel Torgan 02:58:48 Gotcha, okay.
Cletus Cobbington 02:58:49 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:58:56 is like where the most badass people are from. And you have this little like prehistoric map. So I'll move you to the actual world map for reference of it. But Isoptera is also the only dome that has like unimpeded access to the north.
Dungeon Master 02:59:17 And so it makes sense that the first people to discover the ashen fields were from the dome that could get access. But there was this eternally cold region in the far north that...
Dungeon Master 02:59:32 Not only did it like constantly have snowfall, but they discovered there was this constant ashfall. And then on top of the snow was always this layer of soot that sort of when stepped on would turn black but undisturbed was white. So it was like this really eerie sight as you trek through it, your footsteps were left in black and they created the lore about it. But they were going up that way because...
Cletus Cobbington 02:59:58 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:59:59 as soon as they hit the sort of top of the continent, they got the site of this enormous tree that they had later named the tree of death because of when you walk towards it, you are like walking towards your doom. Very, like, metaphorically named because of the ash and how it looks in the snow. While you're
Dungeon Master 03:00:26 in your dream remembering reading about this you maybe had the memory recall because of what you had seen earlier that day but you have this weird sensation that you're being watched behind you and as you spin give me a quick perception check
Cletus Cobbington 03:00:39 Thanks.
Cyrus Schwert 03:00:53 Continuing the good rules.
Dungeon Master 03:00:55 Yeah, it's good. Get them out this session. Which you don't see is what we're going to start with next session, because Bren, you are standing next to a figure watching Cyrus have this dream. But we'll pick that up next time as I explain how you got there.
Zariel Torgan 03:00:58 Uh-huh.
Cletus Cobbington 03:01:10 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 03:01:12 Oh goodness. Okay.
Dungeon Master 03:01:18 But everybody would be completing your long rest. Nothing's going to impede that. So in the very comfortable confines of your firefly lit, willow tree, respite, you all hit level 9. You catch up to Cletus. Let's go ahead and roll all your hit dice before we get off.
Zariel Torgan 03:01:34 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 03:01:35 Hell yeah.
Kaladen Shash 03:01:43 1036. Right in the middle. Right in the middle. Got the three, get to rerow on this.
Cletus Cobbington 03:01:44 I had rolled a six when I did mine.
Dungeon Master 03:01:52 Yeah, ones get re-rolled. Nice. Oh, 8. Everybody take in standard stuff.
Cyrus Schwert 03:02:00 You still do the re-roll one thing? Let's fucking go. I think. I think I'm going to send a multi-glass.
Kaladen Shash 03:02:16 You.
Zariel Torgan 03:02:18 Nice.
Dungeon Master 03:02:20 Cletus, Druid, Cyrus, Bard. Nice, okay. You don't have to reveal it if you don't want to. You've got the, until next week to figure it out.
Leopold Magnus 03:02:21 If you know...
Cletus Cobbington 03:02:25 Oh shit, I didn't even think about that.
Cyrus Schwert 03:02:36 Okay, okay. I might not turn out. You go all the class. Then you go all the way down and then add another. Then you're on your managed level screen.
Cletus Cobbington 03:02:53 How do you do a multi-class like that? I've never even done it. Ah, gotcha. That is something to think about then.
Cletus Cobbington 03:03:25 Cool.
Dungeon Master 03:03:26 Yeah, I mean, there's usually like classes that are optimal to multi-class into, but I don't use prerequisites. So you can multi-class into anything if you want to. It doesn't have to make sense. Just like understanding that some classes are not super compatible and some are. But if you want to go for it, do it.
Dungeon Master 03:03:59 I previously had a barbarian bloodhunter multi-class. And that's a non-intelligence character mixed with an intelligent character. So it wasn't super optimized, but it was a lot of fun.
Zariel Torgan 03:04:06 Yes.
Cletus Cobbington 03:04:08 Oh shit. Oh shit.
Leopold Magnus 03:04:12 Tough. Yeah, that's tough. Hmm. Yeah, that was good. That was a lot of fun. We had a tough time getting out of that forest.
Cyrus Schwert 03:04:25 Sweet. Yeah, we fucked up that dragon now.
Dungeon Master 03:04:29 guys we'll call it there you guys want to walk that dragon I don't know I think maybe one of you roll the damage number that didn't show up green the entire fight like they weren't always Chris but like
Kaladen Shash 03:04:34 Not rolling great, but great roles. Damage rolls were on. Great. Great.
Cletus Cobbington 03:04:43 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 03:04:44 yeah we fucked that thing up we uh we've honed her skills you know we uh we've we've ponder skills you know fighting t rexes and then we also kill that other dragon
Zariel Torgan 03:04:45 Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Dungeon Master 03:04:55 the amount of times where you would roll damage and it would just be green because you were above average was insane yeah you killed the so yeah you killed a young red dragon in like the tunnels
Cyrus Schwert 03:05:02 Yeah. We were crushing it.
Kaladen Shash 03:05:12 Red Dragon, we get rid of the road problem. Yeah, okay.
Leopold Magnus 03:05:14 Yeah. Damn. But you said you took. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:05:20 And so this was an adult black dragon. So like the next dragon level up from there. It's supposed to be really hard. And in fact, by itself, without anything else, an adult black dragon is CR 14.
Cletus Cobbington 03:05:28 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 03:05:31 You'd fuck. You'd fuck, right him.
Zariel Torgan 03:05:38 Damn.
Dungeon Master 03:05:40 I probably made it CR 15 because I gave it 100 extra HP knowing that the party was stronger than your CR. And it didn't, it did not matter. That's fine. I'm never going to make. I had, um, the encounter checks were grouped in by,
Leopold Magnus 03:05:52 Just melted it. Yeah, the next time then you'll bring in a real tough monster and we'll have some shit rolls and just get wiped out.
Kaladen Shash 03:05:59 Uh-huh.
Cyrus Schwert 03:06:01 Yeah. He's all curled up.
Cletus Cobbington 03:06:03 Epic. I'm Winners!
Dungeon Master 03:06:09 um twos it was like one two three four five six seven eight um and the the adult black dragon was the one two it was like the worst thing you could have gone against hi winston hello it's cold
Zariel Torgan 03:06:22 Oh, ha, ha.

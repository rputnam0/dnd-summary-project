0:00:04: DM: Alrighty.
0:00:07: DM: We'll start with a brief recap, that way if Bren's got a question about the things or it doesn't work, we can always sidetrack for a second.
0:00:11: DM: But we started off our last session describing how our story sort of is post-previous story of a different set of heroes and a different timeline.
0:00:25: DM: a war-torn peoples, refugees starting anew, and the slow but gradual recovery of an entire continent.
0:00:33: DM: We overview described New New Arbor, a megacity on the very urge of starting their industrial arcane revolution.
0:00:41: DM: Technology exists, but it's hard to get access to.
0:00:45: DM: Certain districts very much reflect the aesthetic and belief system of classic high fantasy and the caste systems, but others focus on developing and perfecting how to incorporate and tinkering new inventions into their lives.
0:00:59: DM: It was established that each of the four domed cities have currently lost contact with each other, where only the west dome was known to have been truly destroyed in the aftermath of a mad mage ruler with a selfish wish.
0:01:14: DM: Now, hundreds of years later, a certain small fraction of the city's population is born with this curse that he imbued into his people.
0:01:22: DM: The curse runs through their veins and with it, carries the potential for immense potential to transform into unspeakable monsters or into legendary warriors of unmatched skill.
0:01:35: DM: Each of our three heroes, Kaladin, Leopold, and Zariel, through their mostly separated lives, found common ground while trying out for the esteemed position of Stonewall Legionnaire, a sentry guard post that operates for the central power of the city and has free access between the districts.
0:01:52: DM: They had to come together and fight a cursed noble who had finally been pushed to the edge.
0:01:57: DM: With his hot head and negative attitude, he exploded into a flaming monster and assaulted the three fighters.
0:02:04: DM: The party, with the help of the Lord Marshal of the city, extinguished this threat and were promptly extended invitations to join not just the guard, but a special section of the guard built entirely of cursed soldiers. This new initiative from the Lord Marshal is to combat the rapidly increasing emergence of the isotropic cursed beings and also to try to sort of social public image, uh,
0:02:33: DM: bring less of a negative light on the people who are born with the curse that they can't help. Sort of make them more of a hero position and not just like, oh yeah, of course a cursed being blew up the market kind of deal.
0:02:46: DM: And that is where we ended our session.
0:02:51: DM: So we start today with each of you has had a chance to recover and rest over the night.
0:02:57: DM: You had the Corps medics healed your wounds and sent you off, and you know that, including today, you have three total days to decide if, one, you are going to show up for the newcomer attendance call and initiation, which are in the barracks.
0:03:12: DM: You are also tasked to seeking out the Corps' smithy, a person Captain Levi only referred to as Hamhawk.
0:03:25: DM: So that's sort of where we are right now. And then the other really important thing, you were asked to that if you wish, you had the ability to move into the barracks between now and the three days.
0:03:33: DM: But that's only sort of if you're living situation is not as good outside as it would be inside. So like the barracks aren't amazing, but they're better than like, being homeless kind of deal.
0:03:47: DM: So certain members of the party might enjoy their sort of
0:03:53: DM: modest but impressive housing, and other people who lived in a tunnel might be like, yeah, a bed would be cool.
0:04:02: DM: But we sort of pick up today with who's got what decisions going, who wants to sort of lead it off, make a plan, do you guys want to meet up, go separate, it's all sort of on you to start this.
0:04:19: Leopold Magnus: I would turn to Zariaul and ask him,
0:04:31:  Zariel Torgan: Well, I don't know if it'll be opulent, but it'll be better than the tunnel.
0:04:39: Leopold Magnus: Hmm, indeed, yes. I've been realizing now that I've come to the surface that who I was before was somebody else.
0:04:44: Leopold Magnus: I've changed quite a bit. I think I guess I could take just a nice cot.
0:04:55:  Zariel Torgan: Are you remembering more than before?
0:04:59: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, yeah. I think something brought it out of me.
0:05:03: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, indeed. It's a different life here.
0:05:07: Leopold Magnus: Something's different. The city's changed.
0:05:13:  Zariel Torgan: Well, maybe this challenging yourself is better for learning a bit more about your past.
0:05:27:  Zariel Torgan: I would agree. All I have to do is get my plants, and then I'll probably be heading on over there.
0:05:39:  Zariel Torgan: Well, somebody's got to keep an eye on you.
0:05:48: Leopold Magnus: But I think I've just kind of backed up into a brick wall, maybe a corner of the building, and bam, backed into it to the point where it just crumbles around me.
0:06:01:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah, I'll just shake my head and we'll make our way back to our little abode.
0:06:07:  Zariel Torgan: I imagine that we probably, if we don't live together, live near each other in that area, because I probably...
0:06:14:  Zariel Torgan: spend a good deal of time down there working on stuff, so probably just grab some of my personal belongings and all that and head on over.
0:06:28: DM: Got it. So you maybe spend the first half day doing that or first full day, but that'd be sort of your task. Kaladin, what would you want to do in sort of your three days prep time?
0:06:43: Kaladen Shash: I think I would probably be pretty eager to be closer to or part of the Legionnaire now.
0:06:52: Kaladen Shash: So I think even though I've got a fine living situation, I would still go to the bunks the next morning or whatever after the tryout.
0:07:10:  Zariel Torgan: I like the sound of that.
0:07:18: DM: Three, yeah. Nothing happens. I was just rolling the scene. I just happened to go there at the same time.
0:07:25: DM: Conveniently meet up.
0:07:29: DM: But you guys move in without issue. There's always spare bunks. You have like foot lockers for Zariel and Leopold.
0:07:39: DM: There's like dorm room type areas too. So you have like just space to yourself. It's tight for Leopold because he's
0:07:47: DM: taller than just about anybody, but like very comfortable for yourself, Zario.
0:07:55: DM: Kaladin, it's up to you whether or not you want a room or just like a bunk out in the commons area. Everybody's sort of going back and forth, moving in and out. You get like pamphlets and papers and informational stuff.
0:08:07: DM: uh you like there's like listing boards and there's like other boards and like other sort of more guarded rooms that just have like high priority missions that are being tackled and some that need to be tackled you see team assignments you've got all these different stuff going on and everybody's moving throughout their day you have all these arcane piping above your heads that channels power to the different parts of the city um it's just like
0:08:34: DM: Very busy. You're in a mix of like business and living area. So it's just maybe a different pace than you're used to, but it's cool.
0:08:41: DM: It's a great change.
0:08:49: Leopold Magnus: So we're in a room, uh, or are we just in a common bunk?
0:08:52: DM: We'll say you guys, it was up to you.
0:08:55: DM: I imagine since you guys wanted to be together, you would pick a room where you have like a permanent space for your stuff.
0:09:01: DM: The commons area is just like a bunch of open cots and beds. And then everybody's got like their own lockers and clothing space. So you sleep wherever, and then you've got space for your own stuff.
0:09:13: Leopold Magnus: Yeah. Gotcha. So the Leopold is kind of like Robocop, giant metal man, kind of actuating his steam powered pistons. Moving forward, just walks straight into the doorframe, and I think takes a big chunk off the top of it.
0:09:29: Leopold Magnus: And then I swing back around to Zario and I say, boy, Zario, this is quite the upgrade, don't you say?
0:09:33: Leopold Magnus: And I take the bed and I just kind of push it up against the corner and I walk over and I just kind of power down and I'm like, this is a perfect spot to lay the head.
0:09:46: DM: The whole room goes quiet and everybody just looks at you as you've destroyed the doorway and then like tore a bed off the ground, unbolted it.  and like put it up against you just standing there. Everybody's just looking at you. Some dude's like halfway through eating a bite, just like letting the slop fall back to his plate. You hear a little bit of murmuring, and then everybody sort of stops paying attention and goes back to what they were doing.
0:10:15:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah, I just kind of watch that and I'm just kind of like, yeah, I would say so. And then I'm just gonna set my bag down next to the bed, just sit on the bed,  and kind of just look around, take it all in. Can I see if on the boards that you're talking about, if there's people that appear to be the same status as us or close, and kind of see what they're doing, whether they're following some sort of routine or looking for something specific?
0:10:46: DM: I would say at this point, none of it really makes sense to you. You look up to it and it's got like certain squad numbers and it's like attached to case numbers. So none of it makes sense in that way. But you see, like if you go to another locked room and you see some people chatting in there and going over like papers and packets and like circling things and trying to like connect the dots, you see like these high profile cases and missions that need to be worked.
0:11:02: DM: Like some of them don't have assignments under them.
0:11:15: DM: and then you see other ones that do and then go ahead and just give me a general check and depending on how good it is you'll see like better information versus standard information.
0:11:26:  Zariel Torgan: So perception is just straight, okay.
0:11:29:  Zariel Torgan: Up to you. Perception or invest.
0:11:32:  Zariel Torgan: That's a natural 20. Natural 20.
0:11:33:  Zariel Torgan: Hell yeah. Hold on, I gotta mark that down so I don't lose it.
0:11:42:  Zariel Torgan: Nice. I think that's my third nat 20.
0:11:45:  Zariel Torgan: It is, yes.
0:11:46:  Zariel Torgan: Nice.
0:11:48: DM: Great.
0:11:50: DM: What do you get? Alrighty, so you see in that room, you didn't recognize him at first, but back towards you, facing away, leaning back in their chair with like one leg casually crossed over the other with his knee real high. You see Captain Levi sort of pushing up onto two feet and then back onto all four feet of his chair and then back up into two. And he's just like passively listening to whoever this investigator is, some mage going over the case.
0:12:16: DM: and as you're like walking by you look down and you see like pictures of like outside events you see like planes and grass and you see like divination spells transcribed into like a prestidigitation stone and like a minor illusion that shows like pictures like pretty far out but
0:12:40: DM: images of what seems to be another domed city, and Captain Levi's just listening very intently.
0:12:48: DM: And then as you continue to walk, because you can't just turn and stand looking through this very obvious window at them, you're just walking and seeing this, you see another case that's got missing people, Storm District, which has got a bunch of question marks next to it and no assigned case.
0:13:05: DM: You see another one that says,  some form of undead found in dawn district dispatch um omen knights and you see another one that says alabaster lords to oversee a final council meeting like just all this information and things you've never seen before but without even needing a history check you know that the omen knights are sort of like
0:13:33: DM: elite forces of the guard like that's something you get promoted into you have private living quarters your armor is insane like they're very they're almost like whispers but they're like everybody knows about some kind of deal like a boogeyman that you want to be yeah alabaster lords are like the squad assigned to protecting uh like high profile individuals
0:14:02: DM: they're almost entirely mages who use like uh a very secreted type of magic and they're like shaved heads tattoos over their face they have they all have tattoos that go around their mouths of like arcane things like their words directly get used through like their focus because their focus is like the runes around their mouth they're like very
0:14:27: DM: very powerful beings that like nobody sees you don't know they're there kind of deal and so to see their name written on something is crazy to begin with this one it verifies their existence and two they're like actively working for the core but i'll say within that 20 that's about as all you get as you like walk by this room yeah yeah that's a lot i'll uh just casually loop back around and i'll uh
0:14:52:  Zariel Torgan: fill Leo in.
0:14:57:  Zariel Torgan: Do I happen to see any other people that I recognize from the day that I was accepted, or has he not came back in yet?
0:15:08: DM: The Count is there at this point. He's just, I don't know, maybe loading some stuff into his locker, his wardrobe, things like that, unpacking some stuff.
0:15:19:  Zariel Torgan: All right. Can I say something to him?
0:15:24:  Zariel Torgan: I don't know, can you?
0:15:26:  Zariel Torgan: I'll just go over and I'll just, hey, couldn't help but notice you're moving in.
0:15:31:  Zariel Torgan: I thought perhaps you might be a little too high class for that. I'm glad to see that you're rubbing elbows with us grunt workers.
0:15:45: Kaladen Shash: It's going to take me a second to think about the accent.
0:15:53:  Zariel Torgan: You're Russian.
0:15:54: Kaladen Shash: I know, I know.
0:15:57:  Zariel Torgan: Nastrovje. Find yourself a starter word. I know, that's exactly right.
0:16:29:  Zariel Torgan: Well, you make a fair point. And I just, uh, give- put out my hand to give you a handshake.
0:16:37: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, reach- reach right out.
0:16:40:  Zariel Torgan: Um, I'll meet- I'll meet- Shake your- shake your hand a little bit.
0:16:45:  Zariel Torgan: Say, well- I re- Oh, go ahead.
0:16:56: DM: Real quick, this is just a great story point to drop in.
0:17:00: DM: As you guys, the moment your fingers like connect for the shake, you feel a jolt of magic.
0:17:06: DM: And it doesn't go both ways, but Kaladin, you get images of green, lush, forests, bird calls, all of these things that like don't make sense to you.
0:17:16: DM: And it's very reminiscent of a lot of dreams you've been having your whole life.
0:17:27: DM: You tend to dream of what you imagine the Feywild is, just constant expanses of lush and green and all this stuff, but you've never had this experience where you touch somebody and it evokes that imagery. But it's just a moment. Think of it as a quick of static just connecting. It happens instantaneously and your brain just processes what you absorbed for the next 10 seconds as he's talking.
0:17:53:  Zariel Torgan: And then as that's going, I'll just say, uh, well, you did quite well yourself. And, uh, I think, I think we've got some good work to do.
0:18:07: Kaladen Shash: Um, I think I, I think I would be slow to like, let go of his hand after like receiving all of that image or kind of thing.
0:18:14: Kaladen Shash: And then Zahrael didn't experience any of that, right?
0:18:16: Kaladen Shash: It was just one sided, like you said.
0:18:23: Kaladen Shash: Okay.
0:18:27: Kaladen Shash: What part of the city are you from?
0:18:31:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah, I mostly work in the core.
0:18:33:  Zariel Torgan: Me and Leo, we keep things running right. I just noticed a bit of a change in myself. A bit of potential. Figured I would try it out. To be honest, I really haven't done anything quite like at the trials, but...
0:18:53:  Zariel Torgan: If there's ever a time to shine, you know, that's the time.
0:19:05:  Zariel Torgan: Oh no, not a little old me.
0:19:16:  Zariel Torgan: Yes, not the most well-traveled, I would say.
0:19:20:  Zariel Torgan: But I hope to one day.
0:19:24: Kaladen Shash: Jonathan, would I have ever left the Sweets District? Like, would I have ever traveled to the Emerald Grove? And would I have known images I just saw were like or unlike the Emerald Grove?
0:19:38: DM: Yeah, I would say somebody of your general family status.
0:19:42: DM: has the ability to go between the districts, like you're one of the exceptions to the rule. Uh, Zariel, he says that, but you don't have memories of going to the Emerald Grove because you've worked pretty much just in the core and the surrounding areas, like inside the wall, on top of the wall, uh, since then. So you know what it is and you know what it looks like from afar, but I don't know that your character would have been like, oh yeah, I vacationed in the Emerald Grove last summer.
0:20:07:  Zariel Torgan: yeah no when he said that i was imagining that um i would just kind of go along with it because the assumption i thought it was yeah you know if not uh yeah no i've been underground i have been stuck you have been there and
0:20:27: DM: Though images shared with you, yes, sort of reflect more of the Emerald Grove, but in general your dreams are like images and almost seem like memories you don't actually have of what you assume is the Feywild.
0:20:35: DM: Like an entire realm of just untamed wilderness.
0:20:52: DM: sort of drives what you are looking for you haven't quite found that yet well with that um i'll just uh put a hand on top of the shaking hands give him one uh one good pump and i'll say well it's been nice chatting i'm gonna get settled and uh let's see if we can't
0:21:19:  Zariel Torgan: get something done. And then I just mosey on back towards Leo. And I'll tell Leo everything that I saw and heard from that look inside that little meeting, just to see if it sparks anything for him or anything like that.
0:21:35: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, so I'll respond and I'll say, well, Zario, the Omen Knights, my brother was an Omen Knight, you know that.
0:21:43: Leopold Magnus: And I'll just kind of continue on without even really paying any attention or putting it together as to what that means.
0:21:51:  Zariel Torgan: Uh, can I... Do I believe him?
0:21:53:  Zariel Torgan: Can I do, like, a check or something?
0:22:00:  Zariel Torgan: Alright, yeah, I'm gonna incite that. 18.
0:22:04:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah, you get the impression that Leo does think that's what happened.
0:22:14:  Zariel Torgan: Well, that's very interesting. You'll have to tell me more about that.
0:22:20:  Zariel Torgan: What's that?
0:22:22: DM: He is under the impression that's what it was.
0:22:30:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah, that's good.
0:22:33:  Zariel Torgan: I like that.
0:22:36:  Zariel Torgan: I'll just kind of, huh, you know, you think you know somebody.
0:22:41:  Zariel Torgan: And then I think by then, is it towards the end of the day or?
0:22:47:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah. After moving, gathering all your stuff, Kaladin probably would have to make multiple trips back and forth, just on the main thoroughfare peoples.
0:22:54: DM: You guys get dinner in the mess hall or on your own, up to you. But, um, as you guys bed down for the night, uh, you know me, I love my little dream sequences.
0:23:06: DM: So who wants to go first?
0:23:09: Leopold Magnus: Dreaming. Dreaming, is that what you said?
0:23:11: Kaladen Shash: Dreaming, is that what you said?
0:23:14: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, just for story mode, can I just say that I would have moved my footlocker or trunk to the bunk area or the room next to Leo and Zariel just to have a little proximity?
0:23:22: Kaladen Shash: Yeah.
0:23:28: Kaladen Shash: Okay.
0:23:30:  Zariel Torgan: And if you said that he took multiple trips, did you say he took multiple trips to get in there with his stuff?
0:23:36: DM: Up to him. I just said I imagine it would have because he has more things than you guys certainly do, but he doesn't have a lot.
0:23:36:  Zariel Torgan: I just said I imagine it would have because he has more things than you guys certainly do, but he doesn't have a lot.
0:23:42: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, while I may have wealth, I still am only... I'm ultra-minimalistic in this approach.
0:23:49: Kaladen Shash: So I would still only have as much as anyone else in the elite squad, like one footlocker of personal items, you know, whatever.
0:23:57:  Zariel Torgan: Gotcha. Okay, no worries.
0:24:06:  Zariel Torgan: I can't volunteer for the dream sequence first, because I'm too excited. I gotta let somebody else go first.
0:24:10: Kaladen Shash: I'll dream away. Take it away, Brent.
0:24:14: Kaladen Shash: Yeah.
0:24:15: DM: Love it. Okay, Kaladin.
0:24:16: DM: You bed down for the night. It's quiet.
0:24:20: DM: You sniffles. People making jokes under their breaths. Very, like, camp-type vibes.
0:24:27: DM: But nothing crazy.
0:24:30: DM: And then you start having the images again.
0:24:34: DM: You don't know where it is because you've never seen it.
0:24:39: DM: It's... It's alien, but so familiar.
0:24:41: DM: And every time you have these visions, it's like you're looking through your eyes, but they're not. They're somebody else's eyes.
0:24:53: DM: You have conversations with people you've never met, but they're so familiar.
0:24:58: DM: All of them, pure-blood Aladdin and elves.
0:25:00: DM: you have a conversation with somebody that you're so good friends with and their hair like burns with autumn leaves their eyes give off trails of orange and red and yellows but they're just pleasant they're just having a conversation you're walking along a river a babbling brook things like that and then flashes of pain and screaming and then back to the images of nature again
0:25:28: DM: And this repeats every night, all night, and you've never had answers for it. It doesn't matter who you talk to or what you train, and you can't get answers to why you seem to be so linked to a past self, a different person, a different time.
0:25:44: DM: You have no idea.
0:25:49: DM: But for however many years you are old, just about every night for at least a couple hours, you just experience memories.
0:25:57: DM: that don't belong to you or you do and you're not familiar with them.
0:26:03: DM: Leopold.
0:26:06: DM: You power down into sentry mode so you're minimally conscious, you know, maybe seeing like infrared into the room, just sort of overlooking the whole barracks, just by yourself, taking in data and then a little bit of static.
0:26:11: DM: happens in the back of your your processing your brain just a static that just creeps up and just gets louder and louder and then you full-on like images that don't belong to you just a voice unfamiliar just one that goes leo very good look at you you're learning so fast
0:26:49: DM: You see a cloaked figure with elongated fingers, the tips of them covered in blood.
0:26:55: DM: You look in a mirror and you see a little boy with stitches running along his full head, as if his cranium had been taken off.
0:27:06: DM: And you hear this person go, you are impressing me more and more each day.
0:27:11: DM: Soon, my weapon, you'll be ready.
0:27:14: DM: Static sort of onsets again, just more of that,
0:27:20: DM: just building up in the background.
0:27:24: DM: And then you hear screaming and you hear that same voice, Leo, no! And you feel burning in your body. And as soon as it snaps out of this, your suit of armor physically like powers up again and you hear just like the psst, and your legs stand up uncontrollably.
0:27:31: DM: And you've never had this before.
0:27:44: DM: This is entirely new to you.
0:27:47: DM: but the emotion of fear, maybe? Anxiety?
0:27:51: DM: Unclear.
0:27:56: DM: Zarya.
0:28:00: DM: You don't normally dream.
0:28:03: DM: It almost, if you had to put it into words, is like you go into a stasis, like a standby, your body just ready.
0:28:11: DM: This had been the case since the accident they told you you had.
0:28:16: DM: You don't remember much of it, but you were found, your head split, body parts mangled, barely a person, in intensive care for months and months as they rehabbed and healed your body, limb regrowth spells, greater restorations, versions of modified memory that are supposed to restore things, but nothing really quite came back.
0:28:39: DM: Your real solid memories sort of onsets with like,
0:28:45: DM: old friends who claim they used to work with you you know good old Todd would visit and bring you a meal each day and you're just you play these in your head as well but then you have first person dreams of you walking down a hall and then it cuts out and you're at a door pressing on it and it cuts out and you wake up and you're just staring at the ceiling and it
0:29:09: DM: faint glow, but you can't make out the details. Everything's blurry.
0:29:17: DM: You hear like a monitor in the back just... And you hear somebody go, this is no good.
0:29:27: DM: He's waking up.
0:29:29: DM: Put him under.
0:29:31: DM: And that's it.
0:29:33: DM: And then all you know, it's the morning again.
0:29:36: DM: You wake up, people are eating their slop, making jokes, everything's fine.
0:29:42: DM: Nobody seems stressed.
0:29:45: DM: But each of you feel like maybe you didn't get the best rest.
0:29:52:  Zariel Torgan: No, I think the biggest twist  Next time I do a background for a character, he's just a normal, well-adjusted guy. Loving family home.
0:30:01: Leopold Magnus: His dream sequence is just literally him unconscious all night.
0:30:06: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, it's just like, yeah, you get a tight eight hours, you feel great.
0:30:06:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah, it's just like, yeah, you get a tight eight hours, you feel great. That would be great.
0:30:09: Leopold Magnus: That would be great.
0:30:16: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, carries his wife and kids around in his wallet. You know, he's got his little picture. If your life was good, you'd have no reason to put it in danger so often.
0:30:22: DM: If your life was good, you'd have no reason to put it in danger so often. It makes for a boring character.
0:30:27: Leopold Magnus: That's true. That's true. That's funny.
0:30:31: Leopold Magnus: So, Jonathan, we have all day to kind of do what we need or would like to do.
0:30:38: DM: You have two full days in theory.
0:30:41: DM: before you have to report and you know that you have to spend at least one of those days heading to the Storm District searching out a smithy known as Camp Hawk.
0:30:53: Leopold Magnus: I was just wondering, I know Captain Levi mentioned there was a library on premise and he kind of laughed at me, but I was kind of interested to locate the library and maybe look around a bit.
0:31:07: DM: Yeah.
0:31:08: DM: you go ahead and give me just a general you can be investigation check or if you're trying to ask people give me just a persuasion check let's let's let's get a baseline of all you do could have been better yeah i mean you've never really spent time up here which makes sense that you just like looking around and first of all the barracks is enormous you're talking like
0:31:24: DM: aircraft hangar sized space of just different people moving around hustling and bustling. Like to just make your way around this space is still pretty alien to you. You don't know the area.
0:31:45: DM: You go to talk with people but like very much rookie hazing and fearful of what they don't understand.
0:31:50: DM: Most people ignore you.
0:31:53: DM: and they'll spit on your like armored boot just like fucking machine and they'll keep walking kind of like nobody's real because you guys don't even have uniforms yet you're very much fresh blood and everybody looks at you and is like oh that's who they brought on kind of deal yeah but with an eight yeah you spend we'll say a couple hours looking around but like
0:32:14: DM: certain doors are locked and they don't open for you unless you have certain clearances and so maybe you just don't have access to the library or maybe you just can't get it. You're not totally sure.
0:32:28: Leopold Magnus: Okay, was Captain Levi still on premise?
0:32:31: DM: You never personally saw him. Zariel saw him in a meeting the day before, but he's not just like around.
0:32:39: Leopold Magnus: Got it. Okay. He was like in his office working on things. Not just kind of like at my desk. Yeah, he was doing something that moment when Jesse rolled a nat 20.
0:32:43: DM: Yeah, he was doing something that moment when Jesse rolled a nat 20.
0:32:47: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, so, you know, as one of these guys walks by and hawks a loogie on my leg or whatever, I just go, oh, oh, oh, good sir.
0:32:52: Leopold Magnus: I'm looking for the library. Have you, have you seen it by chance?
0:33:19: DM: Hey, Billy, this guy's looking for the, uh, library.
0:33:23: DM: You know where to tell him?
0:33:26: DM: And you see Billy, very much like the cool kid of whatever this little group that you've just chosen to pick out is like, library, huh?
0:33:36: DM: We got one of those.
0:33:38: DM: Two doors down on the left.
0:33:45: Leopold Magnus: I appreciate it. Second door on the left. And I take off with a little pep in my step and blast through that second door on the left.
0:33:55: DM: blast from the second door on the left.
0:34:02: DM: I can't have you breaking down every single structure in the world, but let's say you break the door open. Yeah.
0:34:07: DM: I'm going to go open the door, but, uh, from, yeah, there's a guy sitting on the loo and he had a paper in his hands.
0:34:07: Leopold Magnus: I'm going to go open the door, but, uh, from, yeah, there's a guy sitting on the loo and he had a paper in his hands.
0:34:11: DM: He goes, what the fuck? And then you feel like these people behind you attempting to lift you up to like, give you a swirly kind of deal, but you're so heavy. They're just sort of like picking up on the girdle of your like metal belt, like, Oh,
0:34:32: DM: I look down and I'm like, what are you two doing?
0:34:36: Leopold Magnus: Unhand me. I do not appreciate these cruel jokes.
0:34:38: Leopold Magnus: Get in the toilet.
0:34:43: Leopold Magnus: And I go off, maybe do another search of the library.
0:34:48: DM: Yeah, you just turn around and like bowl them over because they can't do anything to you. But yeah, no luck with the library on an eight.
0:34:48: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, you just turn around and like bowl them over because they can't do anything to you.
0:35:00: Leopold Magnus: That was it for me.
0:35:04: DM: Like I said, that's just a couple hours, so you still pretty much have your entire day.
0:35:09: Leopold Magnus: Oh, okay. Maybe when we circle back, I'll take another look.
0:35:15:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah, I figure I might get some breakfast and hang out and do some stretching while he's off doing that. When he comes back, I think I'll pitch going to the Smithy.
0:35:29:  Zariel Torgan: Some of y'all say, well, I'm not sure what they do to armor you up. Maybe they'd like put some skin on you. But maybe we should see this ham hock guy. I could definitely use something better than these rags.
0:35:46: Leopold Magnus: Why indeed, Zario. I agree. There must be something you could put on that's more protective than that plain penny clothes.
0:35:56:  Zariel Torgan: Well, maybe we should get our fancy friend over here to show us the way. I'm sure he's a little more familiar with the districts than the likes of us. I mean, I can barely find my way anywhere outside the Core. You think we should? I think it's our best bet.
0:36:19:  Zariel Torgan: Alright, well, you want me to talk to him or you want to talk to him?
0:36:22: Leopold Magnus: Oh, I don't know if I'm really that good of a talker, to be honest with you.
0:36:27: Leopold Magnus: I'm not having a great time with these ruckus people around here. Quite frankly, there were some very rude gentlemen I just came across.
0:36:35:  Zariel Torgan: Well, you gotta cut them some slack.
0:36:37:  Zariel Torgan: I mean, you're a bit different. I mean, you're a giant metal man, and they're, uh, not. So, you know, they're probably intimidated is all.
0:36:47: Leopold Magnus: Hmm, I do suppose.
0:36:51:  Zariel Torgan: Well, what do you say we go over there together? Here, we'll go talk to him. Is Kaladin still, is he in the vicinity?
0:37:04: Kaladen Shash: You haven't gone anywhere.
0:37:08:  Zariel Torgan: So yeah, I'll just try to unimposingly walk over and say, hey, Kaladin, was it?
0:37:15:  Zariel Torgan: My friend and I here are looking to  go to that ham hock and possibly get ourselves some better armor.
0:37:27:  Zariel Torgan: Would you care to join us? Maybe you could show us the way a little bit?
0:37:45:  Zariel Torgan: Well, all right. You sound much more confident and, uh, your voice sounds a lot better this time. So, um, I think, I think it'll be good.
0:38:05:  Zariel Torgan: Well, I haven't been talking that much. Uh, but yeah. Uh, uh, yeah.
0:38:12: Leopold Magnus: The name's Leopold Magnus.
0:38:18: Leopold Magnus: And I just extend out my arm and you just, it's like moves really fast, just.
0:38:25: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, reach out, shake his hand again.
0:38:28: Kaladen Shash: The metal hands extend like they're about ready to just like clamp down really hard.
0:38:35: Kaladen Shash: Hello.
0:38:38: Kaladen Shash: Leo, I remember you.
0:38:47: Kaladen Shash: and
0:38:58: Leopold Magnus: So the visors, it's probably a couple inches, but it's recessed. The light source is coming from something recessed inside the helm. You can't really actually see any eyes. It's just glowing violet-purple light pouring through this large slit in the visor.  And then it's a perfect tee for the mouthpiece.
0:39:22: Leopold Magnus: And where the mouthpiece is, it's a little bit faintly glowing, but it's not quite as bright.
0:39:35: Leopold Magnus: I'm a straight shooter. Just ask Zariel.
0:39:49: Leopold Magnus: Well, to be honest with you, I don't know. I haven't really had anything to eat since Sariel woke me up.
0:39:55: Leopold Magnus: I haven't really been hungry either now that you mention it.
0:40:00: Leopold Magnus: Ham hocks, did you say? I remember those. Those were so quite tasty.
0:40:09:  Zariel Torgan: of all the weird things that he says he remembers, because it's starting to concern me.
0:40:31:  Zariel Torgan: Yes, I think that would be quite well. And I'll just throw on my jacket.
0:40:38:  Zariel Torgan: Not sure what the weather's going to be like out there, and hit the road.
0:40:43: DM: Very nice.
0:40:45: DM: You guys set on your path.
0:40:46: DM: You're walking through the pretty busy streets.
0:40:50: DM: In general, anywhere around the core is pretty bustling city-wise.
0:40:55: DM: Most commerce travels through the core before it goes somewhere else.
0:41:03: DM: But as you're making your way, spirits are high, people are talking. Did you guys want to ask anybody about where the smithy is? Or are you just going to try to find it?
0:41:12: DM: See the city kind of deal?
0:41:15: Kaladen Shash: I think, I think we could head all the way to the Storm District and then maybe I would, could I roll to see if I have an understanding of what area of the Storm District you might be in, if there's like a centralized, like, ironworking, smithy, or if there's, it's scattered all over, but I can certainly ask someone.
0:41:33: DM: Yeah, give me, as you guys make your way, we'll just do the roll now, give me just a general history check.
0:41:40: DM: about what you know about this hammock figure. And then as you guys approach the Storm District, eventually everybody sort of clusters together.
0:41:46: DM: As you see, like, people form into large lines as they pass through, like, the security gates where everybody, like, states their purpose. How long they plan to be there. Are they a resident? Where are they from? That kind of very much just like American airport system kind of deal.
0:42:07: DM: As you get through, all you have to tell them is like, oh hey, we're part of the Legionnaire new recruits seeking out Hamhawk, and none of them give you a hard time about it.
0:42:11: DM: You don't get stopped and screened or anything.
0:42:21: Leopold Magnus: Uh, Jonathan, could I make a general history check, um, to kind of maybe remember things about the Storm District? Like, I guess I'm kind of specifically wondering, like, how it came about, like, were there great houses that lived here, you know, like, prominent figures, like, people throughout the years, um, the history of the Dome specific to this district.
0:42:43: DM: Yeah, you can go ahead and give me a history check as well. Uh, 20.
0:42:48:  Zariel Torgan: Dirty 20.
0:42:50: DM: 3 to 20.
0:42:52: DM: Of your fate memories that you do have, you know that you're not from the Storm District.
0:42:57: DM: You're from one of the other districts. You don't know which one you're from, you haven't quite sussed that out, but you know that the Storm District is known for pretty much constant overcast, gray skies, gloomy, it's pretty much raining all the time.
0:43:16: DM: The district is said to feed sort of the more storm aspect of natural magic. It's, you know, most of the followers in the city follow the goddess Aika, who's the goddess of, like, nature, wrath, and storms.
0:43:33: DM: So it's just, like, very much New York, Seattle type.
0:43:37: DM: Lots of business there, but nobody really likes it unless you're into that kind of deal. Like, it's a very specific crowd.
0:43:45: DM: So a lot of the clubs are there, too. Like, everything happens there, but nobody stays, really. And that's general knowledge.
0:43:56: DM: Would you say that people there are generally more unhappy relative to other districts?
0:43:57: Leopold Magnus: Yes. Okay.
0:44:08: DM: A higher concentration of what would essentially be people of Dwarven heritage.
0:44:08: Leopold Magnus: A higher concentration of what would essentially be people of Dwarven heritage.
0:44:14: DM: Gotcha.
0:44:15: DM: Just sort of... stinkers.
0:44:18:  Zariel Torgan: While I got it fresh in my mind, I just realized that I've been using a CR 1 wild shape, and I need to be using a CR 1 quarter wild shape. So for that first encounter, I had an over-buffed guy, so I changed it. So now instead of a dire wolf, it's a regular wolf.
0:44:44:  Zariel Torgan: But we're good now. Okay. And as far as Zariel's concerned, I'm just gonna follow Kaladin. I'm very much a fish out of water here.
0:44:53:  Zariel Torgan: So, I'm just gonna kinda play it cool.
0:44:56: Kaladen Shash: Yeah.
0:44:58: Kaladen Shash: So if I rolled a 13, is that going to be enough to have an understanding of where I might know where this guy's at? Or should I ask someone? You don't, with a 13, you don't know the figure themselves, but like logically you just work out Captain Levi of the Legionnaire recommended a certain smithy that works with the Legionnaire.
0:45:05: DM: So you're probably going to look for an official more government building and it's going to be probably closer to the core than farther away.
0:45:24: DM: And that's just like, you work that out as you're thinking, you're like, don't really know where this figure is, but I can ascertain that I probably don't want to go too far, and I'm going to look for a large, more modern-type building.
0:45:46: DM: Go ahead and give me, since you're leading, a survival check.
0:45:52:  Zariel Torgan: Can I give him a hand with that?
0:45:54:  Zariel Torgan: no it takes like 20 minutes again like you step out of the core like you get under out from underneath the cover of like remembering what is a huge tower right like
0:46:27: DM: You know, you're walking through, you're making your way, you follow the main streets, and as you're walking, you've got a lot of stone buildings, some of them have some metal sheeting, like for cosmetics, but you see one huge building of mostly metal, it's got a lot of metal piping, you see arcane mana funnels through it underneath the street.  And attached to it, you see a large, like, smokestack that you would normally see in a, like, a blacksmith shop. And you're like, probably want to go there.
0:47:08: Kaladen Shash: Just, can I walk right in? Is it like an open air sort of thing? Is it like a front door?
0:47:14: DM: You walk up and there are two, uh, just like Legionnaires posted at this building. And as you walk up, uh, just looking at your group, you see one of them sort of, he's got, uh, a spear that has like some wires at the top, the funnel into the blade.
0:47:22: DM: And he sort of holds it out over the door when he goes, and where do you think you're going?
0:47:34: DM: Um,
0:47:49: Kaladen Shash: What's the guy's name that we're coming? The smithy himself?
0:47:51: DM: You're looking for... Hamhawk.
0:47:53: DM: Is what the hammer told us. Hamhawk.
0:47:54: Kaladen Shash: Hamhawk.
0:48:02: DM: New recruits? Elite squad? You guys don't even have uniforms and you're calling yourselves elite?
0:48:08: DM: Then he makes eyes on Leopold and he's like, the only elite person here is this big fella.
0:48:16: DM: Totally misses that you're not a person. She sees a suit of armor and goes, yeah, that guy.
0:48:28: DM: Give me a persuasion check.
0:48:33:  Zariel Torgan: You can assist on this one if you want.
0:48:37:  Zariel Torgan: I'll just give advantage because I think my intimidation and persuasion are terrible.
0:48:46: Kaladen Shash: Yes or mine?
0:48:47: Kaladen Shash: There's no plus to it, just low scores.
0:48:54: DM: You see this guy like sucks air through his teeth and he goes
0:48:59: DM: yeah i don't i don't think i buy you see how many people you think come up to my door on a daily basis and pretend they're on business of the core a lot i take pride in my job and i'm in charge here good you can say if you're really part of legionnaire you should look up to me for just general advice the name's core and as before this guy can finish your
0:49:25: DM: nice try you in charge not a fucking chance and behind them you see like a six nine five hundred pounds closer to like ogre in appearance just a very large humanoid with like a big underbite in like
0:49:52: DM: sharpened canines and like the incisors on them just sort of stick up and poke out, bad tooth hygiene.
0:49:58: DM: Wearing a huge thick leather apron, mitts tucked into one hand because off of them, but like covered in just general soot.
0:50:09: DM: On their face you see a tiny little pair of like pince-nez glasses at the edge of their like upturned sort of like snout nose, like pig nose type.
0:50:20: DM: And on the top of their head, very clean blonde hair pulled up into a little pigtail.
0:50:37: DM: Gory wipes his ass for his job.
0:50:40: DM: The name's Hamhawk.
0:50:55: DM: Uh, follow me a bit in the back. I got some stuff for you.
0:51:02: DM: And they sort of lumber waddle down the hall, just every step, very heavy.
0:51:08: DM: And they have like almost elephant sized ankles, just like thick.
0:51:13: DM: if it was a person you'd be concerned for their health but like being D&D like this is very much a person with a lot of ogre in their blood moving down the hall you enter this huge elevated ceiling forge tools on every wall benches with various gears you see a whole section of like small clean glass beakers lightning contained in bottles on shelves
0:51:42: DM: books stacked on books tomes you've got like arcane etch guns that sort of dig in and etch magic into weapons to sort of speed up enchanting processes like a very established shop that any tinkerer would be like slack jawed looking at just like incredible all the tools you think anybody would need and that hemp goes oh
0:52:10: DM: Fuck, where did I put it? Oh, over here!
0:52:13: DM: The beginner stuff!
0:52:16: DM: And you see, like, general pauldrons, chest plates, greaves, shoulder pads, swords on the wall, all of it, like, base-cast?
0:52:24: DM: None of it's custom-designed yet?
0:52:28: DM: and Hema goes I'm just gonna guess uh Levi didn't explain shit right right anyway so how this works is you report to me you sort of give me an idea of what you want and I work on it and get it into the core they have some final things they got to install to work for them as an entity um there's like a vital monitoring system that tracks your general health
0:52:54: DM: so that like if your unit was in trouble they could dispatch some extra troops your way that kind of deal there's uh some healing specifications that i'm not very good at i'm not great at divine magic so uh they'll have to do those final touches but i get the i get the basic gear worked up for you pretty quick so uh just anybody want to spit ball some ideas at me i can i can work something up with
0:53:21: Leopold Magnus: I think if I saw her walking into the room, I'm gonna like tap Zarya on the shoulder and I'd be like, boy, did you hear that man, Corey?
0:53:41: Kaladen Shash: So just like above table, like right now,
0:53:46: Kaladen Shash: Jonathan, I'm limited in what I can truly wear, so I'm just gonna, am I just asking for robes for right now, and then we'll get to regularly check in with this guy? Is that what's gonna kind of occur? Okay.
0:53:56: Kaladen Shash: All right, I'm back.
0:53:57: Kaladen Shash: I'm not sure what happened.
0:53:57: DM: I'm not sure what happened.
0:54:01: DM: To be clear, Hamhawk is a very large, stout, and thick being, but appears to be female.
0:54:13: DM: uh you missed the general description of like a artificer slash tinkerer's workshop and hamhawk explains that uh how this works is you give them an idea of everything you sort of are looking for in the gear and then they sort of put together the rough pieces they build out the armor to specification meeting legionnaire standards but throwing in your
0:54:33: DM: twist you know if you're looking for mobility more space between the plating if you're looking for heavy gear more armor plates than movement and then that armor gets sent to the core and you get it on your first day after the core has done like certain modifications to it to make it like because hamhawk doesn't work with our divine magic so they couldn't do healing capabilities to it and stuff
0:55:05: Leopold Magnus: Jonathan, canonically, this is just sort of drawing board. Did you mention that there's some kind of, like, basically arcane cannons or firearms or are those not a thing in this world?
0:55:19: DM: There are, like, highly advanced crossbows, like, the most advanced crossbows anybody has seen in public eyes probably are what you saw that Captain Levi has where they're almost
0:55:25: DM: so sleek and aerodynamic and like minimalist design they would resemble a revolver but they still have like bolt arms and there's still technically uh like a pull string to it you don't know the mechanism of how it reloads and stuff because it's so like thin but there's not like outright guns in the world yet kind of deal okay like i said this is a world
0:56:00: DM: That's very much high fantasy, but it's like on the edge of hitting the arcane industrial revolution. Like it's not there yet, but it's very much like an inevitable way at this point.
0:56:13: Leopold Magnus: I see. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.
0:56:15: Leopold Magnus: I was just wondering if I could do like an investigation or maybe an arcana check around the workshop.
0:56:21: Leopold Magnus: Just kind of looking for... Are you being pansy or are you just looking?
0:56:25: Leopold Magnus: Uh, no, I'm just kind of looking around. Um, I, I think maybe just kind of lost in, in my search, not really even paying attention to hammock.
0:56:34: Leopold Magnus: Um, yeah, give me, uh, either investigation or perception with advantage.
0:56:41: DM: Okay.
0:56:44: DM: Was there anything else?
0:56:45: DM: Anybody else say something?
0:56:57: DM: Leopold, you could roll it with advantage.
0:57:00: Leopold Magnus: Oh, that was an investigation check. My perception is a plus zero, so... Yeah, you get to roll both with advantage.
0:57:07: Leopold Magnus: Oh, I see. Okay, got it.
0:57:10: Leopold Magnus: Oh, that's better. Excellent.
0:57:12: Leopold Magnus: I guess, specifically, I was looking for maybe, like, prototype things, or just... I feel like I could be drawn to some of these things, so just kind of interesting gizmos and gadgets that you wouldn't see day-to-day, I guess.
0:57:24: DM: yeah uh 21 is pretty good i'll give you some more uh you see like very much what you assume like you're walking around as ham hock is like talking to one of the other of the party members while they're describing their costume you're off doing your own thing uh but you see that there's like uh you go to a far table next to the arcane like etcher the one that imbues enchantments at a very small scale um
0:57:50: DM: on that table looks like to be a new prototype of a new bolt thrower where you don't see arms on it that would like hold the the tension to shoot the actual bolt instead you see a line of runes that run up the edge and it almost seems like it's charging where you see like a blue line go up 25 of the thing and then down a little bit
0:58:13: DM: and then up to like 26% and then down so like the runes slowly light up right to left down the barrel of it and then recede like it's just sort of being imbued with magic right now very much just like being worked on but you're like that is a cool weapon and then you're walking and you see like uh
0:58:35: DM: like ceramic shells that are and like next to it is a little arcane vial that has like a little thundering storm in them a little bit and it looks like pieces that fit together where you could pull a pin and throw it and as it hit the pin would break the bottle on impact and it would explode so like a very controlled handheld explosive and you see there are swords that have like gaps in the metal
0:59:05: DM: running up the length of the blade down like the fuller where like there's runes very carefully etched on the inside of the blade running up the lengths like in theory because you're pretty good with tinkering just inherently the runes would jump across and fill the middle of the blade with like an element you assume you know like energy sword-esque
0:59:28: DM: But that's just sort of, like, all you get as you're, like, looking at all this stuff. And then Hamhawk goes, hey, isn't he there, all eyes?
0:59:36: DM: I don't want you seeing all my toys before they're ready. Rejoin the group, please.
0:59:42: Leopold Magnus: Oh, oh, yes, of course. Hamhawk, yes, certainly. And I kind of pull out a little notebook.
0:59:47: Leopold Magnus: Well, I guess I don't have anything with me. I'm just a suit armor.
0:59:52: Leopold Magnus: I make an indelible memory in my head in regards to what I saw, which I feel like might be something I could do. I love to think that Leopold's just looking for pockets to pull stuff out of.
1:00:03:  Zariel Torgan: He's like, oh yeah. Leopold actually goes to grab for a note.
1:00:06: DM: Leopold actually goes to grab for a note. Oh, that's great.
1:00:27: DM: I don't imagine you're built for strength, or have I got that mixed up?
1:00:43: DM: Right, so I don't imagine you'd be requesting a set of full plate, right? So just...
1:00:50: DM: general class of armor if you're looking for a sword or a dagger if you want a staff a crossbow like what are you looking to start your job with yeah um i think you can see the robes i'm currently wearing are like some sort of like really fine leather
1:01:09: Kaladen Shash: And they're like a brown and they have like a very blue turquoise accent on them. I don't know. I don't think they're like ruinish lines. They're just sort of like pretty weaves and whatever's right?
1:01:29: DM: Yes, I like the blue. I see what you're doing there. Are you looking for
1:01:34: DM: Like a form-fitting leather or more of a flowing robe? What you're rocking right now is pretty even in between.
1:02:35: DM: A quarterstaff blunted on one end, and speared on the other.
1:02:37: DM: You looking like flared, blunt, like hammer one end, blade other, or just like club one end, spear other?
1:03:21: DM: If you're not loving it, I'll have you just wear it for a couple days and we can modify it as needed.
1:04:14:  Zariel Torgan: I think you have to have a body in order to have body dysmorphia, don't ya?
1:04:21:  Zariel Torgan: Quite possibly, I'm not sure.
1:04:21: Kaladen Shash: Quite possibly, I'm not sure.
1:04:23: Kaladen Shash: It's a carried over trait.
1:04:25:  Zariel Torgan: Oh, that's, yeah. It's psychological, so that makes sense. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1:04:28: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, it's hard. It's hard.
1:04:32:  Zariel Torgan: Let me think here.
1:04:38:  Zariel Torgan: So I'm not sure, mechanically, what you're shooting for. But I'll just say I'd like... Technically, you don't get to pick it.
1:04:43: DM: You get to pick aesthetic of it.
1:04:47:  Zariel Torgan: Oh, an aesthetic? Okay. Well, what I'll do is I'll pull out, um, by this time, the red flower bud that I had found while I was traversing the core. I had flattened in a book. I'll just pull that out of a little sack- satchel that I have. And I'd like to have a- I'd like to have this in sort of a...  emblazoned upon some sort of leather inlay perhaps on my chest or across my back just like a a deep red line across the black dark leather backdrop would be something that I would like so just you know I like the the petals they're pretty uh no I
1:05:36: DM: What kind of fire are you looking for? You said leathers, but leathers, clothing, robes, armor, what's your class?
1:05:46:  Zariel Torgan: Well, I usually use spells to hurt people rather than hitting them with stuff. So probably something light.
1:05:59:  Zariel Torgan: I think I'm proficient with light and medium armor.
1:06:06:  Zariel Torgan: And so whatever would fit, you know, if, uh, like a leather armor or something like that, I think is what I can fit at this point.
1:06:21: DM: Any hoods, capes, things like that. Do you want a weapon?
1:06:29:  Zariel Torgan: I think I'm alright. Well, I started off with maybe some stuff I shouldn't have had. I just grabbed like a staff and a scimitar.
1:06:38: DM: Yeah, this would be the chance to put that in-game. Like, this is where you'd be like, oh yeah, can I get a scimitar and a staff?
1:06:44:  Zariel Torgan: Gotcha, yeah, okay. Well then I'll just, yeah, I'll just let him know. Well, you know, I like having my options. Maybe something pointy and  Something I can, you know, clear the cobwebs with.
1:07:04: DM: And then do you let Hamhawk know, like, your type of magic?
1:07:08: DM: That your class is your druidic thing?
1:07:11: DM: Or do you just mention caster kind of deal?
1:07:17:  Zariel Torgan: Well, I'll let them know if when I'm telling them what I kind of do cast-wise, if they seem to perk up, then I'll elaborate a little more. Thanks.
1:07:31: DM: Oh, we don't get a lot of nature casters on this part.
1:07:44: DM: Well, I think I've got an idea. I've got some prototypes for some armor of your folk.
1:07:50:  Zariel Torgan: Oh.
1:07:52:  Zariel Torgan: Well, uh, I'm very interested.
1:08:05: Leopold Magnus: Oh, yes, well indeed, fine sir.
1:08:09: Leopold Magnus: Well, I'm not really used to the combat type of stuff, so I don't think I really need anything per se.
1:08:15: Leopold Magnus: I don't know, maybe something to hide behind, to be honest with you? You're looking for a shield, that's all?
1:08:26: Leopold Magnus: I think that maybe there's also one thing that I was quite interested in that you're working on over there, if you wouldn't mind sharing. I have quite a mind for those things. I could probably help you with them.
1:08:44: DM: No offense, I don't trust you at the moment, and I do work for some pretty high-powered beings that wouldn't want information necessarily out in public view.
1:09:09: Leopold Magnus: There was nothing there. Yes, I understand full well.
1:09:24: Leopold Magnus: Oh, OK. Yes, I might be of assistance to you. Maybe someday soon.
1:09:32: Leopold Magnus: You are looking for a shield.
1:09:43: Leopold Magnus: Um, well, um, no, I don't think so. Uh, you know, this is quite sturdy.
1:09:50: Leopold Magnus: And, uh, I just look to Zariel and kind of like, go ahead and show him, Zariel.
1:09:54: Leopold Magnus: Take a, take a swing at me.
1:10:02:  Zariel Torgan: I'll just, uh, grab the closest weapon off the wall and just swing it right at him.
1:10:09: Leopold Magnus: I'm not flexing, per se, but if I had a body, I would be flexing.
1:10:15: Leopold Magnus: 16.
1:10:17: Leopold Magnus: Uh, well, am I doing this with my shield or without the shield? Because I don't have one right now, right?
1:10:21: DM: You don't have a shield yet, but... Okay. Uh, your intention was to let him... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
1:10:22: Leopold Magnus: Uh, your intention was to let him... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
1:10:39: DM: you know is going to happen, your armor just sort of like, after six or so seconds, it's going ping, ping, ping, and it sort of outsets itself and mends back into place.
1:10:52: DM: So your frame doesn't take any damage.
1:10:57: Leopold Magnus: So I kind of knock on the plate of the armor and it makes this kind of hollow echoing noise. And I go, see, quite sturdy indeed, right?
1:11:13: DM: I would feel bad if you were the only one who didn't get anything at all.
1:11:19: DM: Uh, weapons for you.
1:11:52: Leopold Magnus: Okay, let's see what we can do.
1:11:58: DM: I'll leave it pretty bare bones and I'll provide a schematic if you're looking to be so inclined to modify at a later time.
1:12:07: Leopold Magnus: Oh, well, thank you. Yes, I'd love to tinker around with that.
1:12:23: DM: I gotta pull out the cast, pour the molds.
1:12:38: DM: So, I don't know. Make yourselves busy or make yourselves scarce. I don't care. I guess Jonathan would... Oh, go ahead.
1:12:43: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, go ahead. You're good, Rex. Go ahead.
1:12:47: Leopold Magnus: I was just from the perspective of my armor, I feel like it is not something I wear. It is like part of me. So from the for the shield, could we could it actually be that ham hock basically makes a mechanical shield and embeds it kind of in my arm to like one of my arms?
1:13:05: DM: I've got an idea. We'll see if you like, but I think it's something. Okay, cool. Yeah, right on.
1:13:11: DM: And do you want any of these to have your artificer infusions specific in them, or do you want to canonically put that on as your character yourself?
1:13:23: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, I think that maybe once I get the gear, I'll tinker with it in my downtime and see if I can improve it, because knowing Leopold, he'll want to kind of continuously build and tinker on things. He doesn't know if he would trust somebody else to work on his gear.
1:13:43: DM: Fair enough.
1:13:45: DM: Okay, you guys hang around for a little bit.
1:13:48: DM: Ham Hawks, for a very large, what you would imagine to be pretty clumsy figure, works with depth and fingers, pours the molds, heats the metal, works the bellows, like pulls down a huge hammer and starts like forging and shaping pieces, putting it into like
1:14:10: DM: an equivalent of like a hydraulic press that uses like arcane gravity spells to apply pressure and like hammers out fine details uh pretty cool work but like it's taking hours and you realize they're not going to be done anytime soon so at some point you guys have to leave um and then do you do anything before we hit the next day or do you want to just roll into initiation day
1:14:35: Kaladen Shash: Jonathan, do you, does Hamhawk have any, uh, like, does she have scrolls, does she have anything else, or is it all just metal work, weapons, whatever?
1:14:49: DM: There are a lot of tomes, but, like, as you're watching them work for a certain number of hours, you sort of, like, peruse through it, and it's all like,
1:14:58: DM: Information instruction manual type stuff how to inlay 30 in chance and things like that, but there's not just like roles of invisibility laying around kind of deal within the storm district or my own district or like back into The market district like was there would there be a place where we could try to acquire?
1:15:22: Kaladen Shash: Roll before leaving Do you have any money
1:15:29: Kaladen Shash: Um, I mean technically the character did have money before I started, but I don't know what I would have started with Like base starting rate is like five GF like five gold whatever your class thing is.
1:15:41: DM: Yeah, but it's not a lot just because the average During a D&D world if you work a full eight hour day makes one gold a day, right pretty low paying for what adventurers kind of do so it's not a
1:16:06: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, fair enough.
1:16:08:  Zariel Torgan: That's a good backstory though, Trust Fun Kid.
1:16:11: DM: That could be, I would love that if that was a front end.
1:16:14: Kaladen Shash: Brian, it was not. Yeah, I just have a lot of money.
1:16:16: DM: Yeah, I just have a lot of money.
1:16:17: Kaladen Shash: I'm going to say I'm just starting with 10 gold piece right now then.
1:16:18: DM: I'm going to say I'm just starting with 10 gold piece right now then.
1:16:21: DM: Okay, and then 10, you would just know this.
1:16:25: DM: Without going to your folks for money ten gold is not enough to buy a scroll, right?
1:16:32: Leopold Magnus: So Jonathan, oh good.
1:16:33:  Zariel Torgan: Oh good. I was just gonna say real quick I was looking at the wrong thing. I can wild shape up to CR one. I was looking at The earlier Druid version of it, but I took circle of the moon so I can do a CR one So I changed back to a dire wolf Okay
1:16:54: DM: Early steps figuring it out.
1:16:56: Leopold Magnus: I love it.
1:16:56: Leopold Magnus: Uh, I was just curious. So what have I gotten armor because I don't have any armor in my inventory, but I wouldn't it's from like a perspective of the game. Like I wouldn't have actually gotten armor. I was wondering if I could have like medium armor or is that too much at this point?
1:17:11: DM: Uh, question for as a war forest, I believe you have natural armor, which is pretty good.
1:17:19: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, that only, um,
1:17:27: Leopold Magnus: Constructed resilience. Integrated protection. I have a plus one bonus to my AC.
1:17:35: DM: Oh, yeah.
1:17:39: DM: I would say we could get you more armor and just say like you technically didn't change, but yeah, like whatever you're proficient in, we can give you like a medium armor.
1:17:54: DM: And you have some studded armor in your inventory if you want to equip it.
1:17:58: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, I think I might change it out for a medium armor. I think studded leather is medium though.
1:18:02: DM: I think studded leather is medium though.
1:18:04: Leopold Magnus: Is it?
1:18:04: DM: Yeah.
1:18:05: Leopold Magnus: Yeah. Oh, okay.
1:18:07: Leopold Magnus: This one, it says underneath. Light. Light armor. Light studded leather.
1:18:16: Leopold Magnus: Oh, that's fine. Is it? Maybe there's a version. Is there a version of a medium?
1:18:17:  Zariel Torgan: Is it? Maybe there's a version.
1:18:21:  Zariel Torgan: I'm not sure. Okay.
1:18:22:  Zariel Torgan: I think medium is like chain, isn't it?
1:18:25: DM: Chain, half plate.
1:18:27: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, I think it's all medium.
1:18:29: DM: But that's pretty high class stuff.
1:18:32: Leopold Magnus: Okay, so I've got this stuff. I think it would make sense to take like a half plate.
1:18:33: DM: I think it would make sense to take like a half plate.
1:18:38: Leopold Magnus: Half plate? Okay. Yeah.
1:18:40:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah, I feel like stealth with the giant metal robot is gonna be tough.
1:18:47: Leopold Magnus: Oh yeah, no, not stealthy at all.
1:18:49: DM: Probably.
1:18:52:  Zariel Torgan: We should put some wheels on you, power you down, just roll you through anything where we gotta be quiet.
1:18:58: Leopold Magnus: That is hilarious. It's like Weekend at Bernie's type of deal. That's good.
1:19:06: Kaladen Shash: I've got one or two sneaky ways we can try to get him through some stuff.
1:19:13: Kaladen Shash: I mean, we can't buy anything. And unless nobody's got a lot of back story, I'm fine going to initiate from there.
1:19:21: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, I'm good.
1:19:23: Leopold Magnus: I was going to grab a quick drink of water. I'll be right back.
1:19:27: DM: Yeah, we need to take a break. Anybody need potty inspiration of the inhalation kind? Anything like that? I've been getting inspired on and off all night.
1:19:34: Kaladen Shash: No problem.
1:19:48: DM: But I might pop out. I'm going to be unmuted because I've got my earpiece in, but I'm going to also do it with Rex.
1:19:55: Kaladen Shash: Jesse, I'm not super familiar with all the Druid school of magics.
1:20:02: Kaladen Shash: What is the Circle of the Moon? What does that tend to lean towards, or what's their backstory? You know, I'm not positive.
1:20:07:  Zariel Torgan: I know that I have, as a Druid,  circle of the moon i get better animal shaped stuff so instead of having uh i guess what would be his wild shape to enhance yeah he keeps his mental snap when he goes into them so he doesn't become like yeah it's like when the wild schmooth did that
1:20:36: DM: No, it's like a Circle of Moons specific that you keep all of your mental stats, not just some of them. So like, he can fully understand and comprehend sentences no matter what he is.
1:20:50:  Zariel Torgan: Well yeah, I think at a certain point I can even cast spells while in my wild shape form.
1:20:57:  Zariel Torgan: Also true.
1:20:58: Leopold Magnus: That's pretty badass.
1:21:00:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah, so I can tank as something with a ton of hit points, and still, you know, it's like polymorph, but I can do it twice a day for free, along with all my other spells. Really, it's just like a huge hit point, like, bank that I get to use.
1:21:18:  Zariel Torgan: Along with, you know, the utility of a druid, you know, druids are very, they're very Swiss army knife.
1:21:18: Kaladen Shash: Along with, you know, the utility of a druid, you know, druids are very, they're very Swiss army knife.
1:21:24: Kaladen Shash: No, it's gonna be good. You're gonna have a bazillion spells available to you, which will be nice. It'll be nice.
1:21:24:  Zariel Torgan: No, it's gonna be good.
1:21:28:  Zariel Torgan: It'll be nice.
1:21:30: Kaladen Shash: It is nice, yeah.
1:21:33: Kaladen Shash: And a lot of ability to change them very rapidly, which is really nice, too.
1:21:39: Kaladen Shash: Oh, yeah.
1:21:45: Leopold Magnus: So where are we headed now?
1:21:48:  Zariel Torgan: I think we just, uh, are skipping to the next day and we're going to start our initiation ritual thing.
1:21:55:  Zariel Torgan: Cool.
1:22:04: Kaladen Shash: Okay. Do what you need. That was a brilliant idea.
1:22:09: Leopold Magnus: Oh, I got it.
1:22:14: DM: When I loaded it was a little too fine and it clogged the bottom.
1:22:17: Kaladen Shash: Hey, real quick question. Were we planning on doing our last in-person? What weekend is that? I think it was the 20th, right?
1:22:26: Leopold Magnus: Next weekend?
1:22:26: Kaladen Shash: Next weekend? Yeah, I thought 19th, 20th, right? Because you have something going next weekend?
1:22:33:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah, I remember 19th, 20th, which is good for me because I've got the... No, we were originally planning on that.
1:22:46:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah. But we had to push it. Yeah.
1:22:54:  Zariel Torgan: I think so.
1:23:00:  Zariel Torgan: Awesome.
1:23:01: Kaladen Shash: I'm very excited.
1:23:03: Kaladen Shash: Very excited. It's going to be badass.
1:23:05: DM: Yeah, I was just reading the notes again and I just remembered that we got the spoons that have all those cool names, but I only wrote down the name and roughly what it does, so I don't even know what mine really is.
1:23:16: Kaladen Shash: We're just like superhuman basically.
1:23:17: DM: We're getting ready to be... It's like if I hit crit or some shit like that.
1:23:23: Kaladen Shash: I know, like I'm... I really, really hope I roll well.
1:23:25: Kaladen Shash: I want to regain like a 7, 8 or a 9 repeatedly. I'd be just so overpowered to be able to cast that so many times.
1:23:35:  Zariel Torgan: I tell you what, you guys are going to need it. We're just all going to go out and fucking blaze in glory.
1:23:42: Leopold Magnus: It would be really funny to TPK. I could pull a wish.
1:23:42:  Zariel Torgan: It would be really funny to TPK.
1:23:50: Kaladen Shash: No, because it's just a crit every time. It couldn't.
1:23:53: Kaladen Shash: It'd be so overpowered.
1:23:54: Kaladen Shash: I guess the odds are still in your favor, though. That's a good point. It's still only a 5% chance. That is so much.
1:24:15:  Zariel Torgan: yeah yeah we'll see it'll be interesting all righty all righty we ready i do blue just moving to the next day uh you guys wake up you have breakfast
1:24:38: DM: uh it's like eggs bacon uh you've got like bagels things like that juices just like general food to get everybody going uh being the new guys you see everybody clears off like this is the start of like the work week now think of it as like the tournament thing was on a friday and then you had saturday and sunday and now it's monday again uh so everybody's like working you see like
1:25:05: DM: You don't see Captain Levi, but you see some other people who are probably pretty higher ranking soldiers are like handing out mission scrolls and things to people, assignments. Like everybody gets suited up in their gear and stuff and like heads out.
1:25:21: DM: and then pretty soon it's like almost bare bones in the barracks and it's just kind of like you three awkwardly standing around and then you see uh like 80 pounds soaking wet like a 5'11 malnourished half orc looking individual sort of like fast brisk walk up to you guys and it takes forever because they start in like the full other side of the room but as they're walking up
1:25:51: DM: They were just muttering under their breaths.
1:25:54: DM: And then finally, this person gets right up to you. And they go, oh, fuck me.
1:25:59: DM: It's the new boys.
1:26:02: DM: How are you?
1:26:08: DM: All right.
1:26:19: DM: Sorry to hear that. Maybe the nice tour I'm bringing you today will fix your mood right up.
1:26:26: DM: Introductions are in order. My name is Donnie Farsight. You can call me Ratshit, though.
1:26:44: DM: Why?
1:26:47: DM: Thank you. Fucking Christ. You guys are real quiet. I know it's your first day, but show some fucking balls.
1:26:53: DM: Uh, you know, y'all get your own, uh, nicknames here too.
1:26:57: DM: We just part of the culture and the hazing.
1:27:01: DM: Uh, my first mission was just to check out the sewer system, looking for a missing kid.
1:27:07: DM: Boy, when I tell you, I got my fucking ass kicked by a very large rat.
1:27:13: DM: scariest fucking thing I've ever seen.
1:27:16: DM: I woke after the reinforcements arrived and it had taken off a couple of my toes.
1:27:21: DM: Nothing they couldn't fix with time, but the boys started calling me rat shit after that, because I fucking shit the bed and it was a rat.
1:27:33:  Zariel Torgan: Horny. Anyway, to the tour then.
1:27:33: DM: Anyway, to the tour then.
1:27:37: DM: Right, Don, here we go. First up, storeroom.
1:27:40: DM: uh you see back to that brisk walk like hands weirdly straight at their side as they like lean forward as they walk right right cheerio let's go uh leads you forward not really taking slow pace as an option uh you hit like the back room and on it are three laid out sets of gear the first one you see uh i had it pulled up and then i lost it so
1:28:15: DM: Gotcha. So the first one, the farthest to the left is a set of like, it is thin metal plating that elegantly lays over itself as like the breast piece and like outlines abs, but like only as like plating goes.
1:28:23: DM: The real piece to it is like where you normally would have shoulder pads. You have like a cloak stitched into the top
1:28:43: DM: pieces of like a cerulean blue that sort of wraps flowing down the back. So like when you wear it, you have a long cloak that sits on your back below the bottom, like a rib metal plates. Fabric is stitched in to like split down the middle so that you could see your legs, but like provides for great movement. But just a large piece of blue skirting material that goes around. So it's like a half
1:29:11: DM: half armor, half robe set, where the cloak drapes over one shoulder and is tucked behind on the back.
1:29:19: DM: Next to that is like a metal, but like a wrought twisted metal, almost like intentional hammer forge marks left in it, but like a wicked black staff.
1:29:32: DM: that ends sharpened into a razor point on when and polished at the blade section, but the whole piece just sort of forms into it. There's not a clean break between handle and spear point.
1:29:44: DM: On the other hand, is like a fist, not quite a fist like punching, but like a hand as if the hand was holding the top of the staff.
1:29:47: DM: So like the grip you would take on the top of a cane.  is the top of the other end of like really nicely detailed finger marks. You can see like the indentations of the skin of the knuckles and there's like really nicely filigreed like fake finger nails and prints kind of done on it.
1:30:04: DM: Really nice piece of work.
1:30:17: DM: And Ratchet looks at the name tag and goes, right, right, right. This one belongs to...
1:30:24: DM: Let's see, uh, Kaladin, uh, Shash.
1:30:28: DM: Shash?
1:30:29: DM: That's your last name.
1:30:33: DM: It's almost worse than Ratshit, I'm not gonna lie. This one's for you, Tridon, see if there's anything that you need. Changing room to the left, or if you're not shy, right here is fine.
1:30:54: DM: Right. So here's this for you. Uh, I'm going to be honest. This is a lovely piece. I haven't seen anything like this before. Uh, you must've made hammock pretty proud.
1:31:01: DM: Um, you see, it is like a shoulder piece. So it goes over the head and sits and it goes into like a partial breast piece that follows down like your sternum, but it's not made of metal. It's like a black,
1:31:18: DM: very hard wood that's been like etched and carved. And there's like little seams of fabric at certain points that allow for mobility in it.
1:31:28: DM: And then just like a beautiful red flower etched into the middle.  and then like the lower torso into like the draping maybe like half skirt cut into like an angle where like then you have like you're just uh leather pants below that there's like a belt of leaves sort of like it's all wood pieces and like this whatever this hard black wood is  but it's just like built together to be like functional armor with respect to the fact that druids can't like traditionally wield iron kind of deal. The sleeves that come down on both sides are like evenly spaced out, like stitched in black pieces of wood in between the red plates. So you've got like, not red plates, the red fabric. So you've got like this alternating fabric, dark wood combo.
1:32:21: DM: And what did you ask for? It was your... Oh, you had that scimitar.
1:32:26: DM: Also, interestingly enough, made of wood, you see like a full-length scimitar of like this deep black wood that's been sharpened to a point and running along the points you can see are like the basic arcane runes that like offer extra protection.
1:32:44: DM: So like using this weapon isn't gonna dull it.
1:32:51: DM: and then a same sort of staff of the material so your whole aesthetic unless you want to change it is like this black red uh like nature type warrior nice now i like it all uh grab it yeah all the way on the right you have two magnets and uh
1:33:19: DM: Ratchet looks at this and he goes I was a little confused on this one as well I maybe thought that the third party of your the third member of your party might be a fridge, but I'm looking for Leopold Magnus is who these are for.
1:33:36: Leopold Magnus: I step forward whirling and humming with large thundering steps and I go Leopold Magnus at your service.
1:33:40: Leopold Magnus: How may I help you today?
1:33:59: DM: I like your vibe. Uh, whatever the fuck these are, this note was also for you and that should hand you like a little hand scribbled note.
1:34:09: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go ahead and read it.
1:34:12: DM: Read it. It just says enjoy slash double H. Hmm.
1:34:18: Leopold Magnus: Okay. Thank you very much.
1:34:20: Leopold Magnus: I'm gonna take the magnets and I'm gonna do like a little you know Arcana check or investigation or something to figure out what what these are for?
1:34:25: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, they're both enchanted what will not both one is enchanted with a
1:34:36: DM: uh like protection like and you pick these magnets up and they're not just heavy but like the most intricate scrolling of arcane runes and you look at it and it's not one piece of magnet it's magnetized but it's like this metal that looks folded on itself and like sets into a specific position one of them's got protect uh protection energy and the other one's got like the runes for uh like like
1:35:06: DM: Evocation equivalent but like projectile magic like it's gonna shoot something Telekinesis, I guess would be the best one on that one.
1:35:15: Leopold Magnus: Oh Interesting. Okay
1:35:17: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, so I guess I kind of pick these up and investigate them, fiddling around with them in my hand and kind of putting two and two together. I hold the magnet kind of close to my arm and I guess I imagine it magnetizes to my arm or my shoulder area.
1:35:34: DM: It magnetizes to your mid forearm equivalent of your armor. And as it does, it feeds a blue aura that sort of goes into your arm
1:35:47: DM: before it fades. And you think like for a second, like how do I make this work? And then you think about it. And in an instant, the whole thing unfolds and you have a shield covering from like shoulder down to mid waist of a solid metal with blue runes etched into it and like a copper plating around the side.
1:36:08: DM: Because then the color of the magnet was like copper orange But when it unfolds the only part of it that is orange is the border and you have like a sleek gray like gunpowder metal Colored shield that just sort of covers if you were to stand sideways with it your entire torso Sick, and then you sort of relax your arm and the whole thing almost like a parachute like fabric and
1:36:34: DM: very gently folds into itself and compacts back into a magnet. So you have a deployable shield.
1:36:41: DM: The other one, you're holding it and it sort of like thrums and it magnetizes to the back of your hand.
1:36:51: DM: And when you think about it, and you sort of like can't figure it out for a second, you hold out your hand in front of you.
1:36:57: DM: And a couple different ways, this will be more of how you the character wanna, you the player wanna play your character, but it'll like deploy into a handheld crossbow that you can grip like a gun or a crossbow, like a hand crossbow, or if you sort of turn palm down, dorsum of the hand up, sort of top of the hand, it can be like a hand crossbow that sits on top of your hand.
1:37:25: DM: up to you i didn't want to steal that from you but you've got now to to your inventory you can put in a medium armor a normal shield or i know one of your tinkering things can give you a plus one so you can do that whatever that is and then you can add that crossbow okay so uh full a full crossbow not a light crossbow right hand crossbow hand crossbow jonathan i'm just adding
1:37:53: Kaladen Shash: robes that have any effect to like a level one mage robe or just I'm just at robes currently just at robes just because and anything otherwise yep um yeah so the other other thing I guess that I was going to say is yeah it would be uh more on the top of my arm like you were describing I think that I would tinker with it so that way it could recess into my
1:38:17: Leopold Magnus: like robotic arm to kind of like emerge when I was going to shoot it.
1:38:24: DM: Again, that's up to you.
1:38:26: DM: You can fully make that up, but back to Kaladin.
1:38:34: DM: Your staff, your quarterstaff is, it can act as your arcane focus, a
1:38:42: DM: bludgeoning damage weapon or you can be slashing damage so you can choose which damage type you're going to deal depending on how you want to swing the weapon oh that's fun you took that in account for both ends that's cool easy fix because it's just going to roll damage and you can say this was this one can be slashing yeah that's cool cool like that it was a good detail uh but anyway uh ratchet just looks at you
1:39:12: DM: Um, oh shit, sorry, uh, uh, give yourself 10, figure out the armors, adjust the fit, fix the straps.
1:39:15: DM: Uh, you'll notice that all of it carry the insignia of the Legionnaire on the centerpiece, except for you, sir.
1:39:25: DM: Uh, uh, what's your name?
1:39:29: DM: Uh, Zariella. Your insignia is on the shoulder pad instead. You have a nice flower in the center. Um,
1:39:38: DM: There's a couple things these armors do for you that I couldn't tell you until now, but standard core Legionnaire equipment requires a couple things.
1:39:44: DM: First and foremost, and this will be a little out of game, just knowledge for you guys, healing potions are less popular because of how tedious they are to use.
1:40:02: DM: the more common thing is like a like vaporized healing potion that like you inhale like a inhaler type bead where it just injects into your throat and then it does that or there's injections and those are the ways that healing potions are administered now or and you see that uh wretched goes on uh your chest piece right there right over the heart uh
1:40:28: DM: Standard military equipment says that you get one minor heal or short rest.
1:40:35: DM: You know, it resets when you're out of combat. You gotta fix some information on it, recharge it, but you get one of those on us each time you fight.
1:40:45: DM: Next up, each of your independent gear are affixed with short-range communication devices, so feel free to chat with each other. I will tell you from experience, the technology's not quite there yet.
1:41:01: DM: There's no means of whispering into these. If you need to send a message to your compatriots, it will project out of their armor and headpiece at full volume, so just food for thought.
1:41:15: DM: don't want you to get in a bind that way.
1:41:18: DM: Additionally, with those per core regulations, all of your armor has long range capability to communicate back to center hub as your armor monitors your vitals.
1:41:23: DM: If you get too hurt and you start to die, we'll send help for you.
1:41:46:  Zariel Torgan: look at mine i'm just kind of shifting the little pieces together tugging on the little bits of fabric i think this looks mattifying that's a pretty cool look uh and well uh officially then welcome to the stonewall legionnaires uh follow me again though rest time is over you all look fitted in your armor
1:42:09: DM: this way this way and he leads you down to like one of the briefing rooms that you hadn't been in before and there's like a neat folder sitting right on the table right there and he goes uh so standard operating procedure dictates that when you finish one mission you get a few days off R&R recovery and then you report for your mission when you're next ready uh just we always have something in the city going on
1:42:35: DM: If you stand out to the management, there are chances to get higher profile cases that come with significant bonuses to that.
1:42:44: DM: Now inside, just something all the boys do, this was started by the Lord Marshal himself actually when he was in the Legionnaire.
1:42:46: DM: You could forego most of your pay, donate it to the Legionnaire to keep things going and in place of a full paycheck,
1:42:58: DM: on a completion of a task, you get entered into the lottery and we draw the lottery daily and it's just a chance to get random magical weapons, armor, knick-knacks, just something fun that you never know what you're going to get. So it's just like, do you want to get paid and then spend it on the shit that all the regular people have or do you want to reinvest it into the lads and get something cooler?
1:43:31: DM: Uh, just something fun. I'll remind you when you get paid. Cause I also collect all the, all the completed missions come right directly to me.
1:43:40: DM: I'm sort of the bookkeeper, which is why I'm still here. Uh, but anyway, so out of character, uh, something where like you will get paid a certain amount of money to do a mission or an assignment.
1:43:49: DM: It'll be a hundred gold per completed mission each, or you take
1:44:01: DM: A quarter of that, you get paid 25 gold and you get a random magic item.
1:44:12: DM: That's fun.
1:44:12: Kaladen Shash: I like that.
1:44:16: DM: And so then he's like digging you along, pulling you down here and he goes, your first assignment comes from, and he looks down in his eyes right in the middle and he goes, fuck me, Captain Levi gave you to this personally.
1:44:28: DM: Quite the impression you made.
1:44:30: DM: hands you the folder who uh ratchet just hands it out straight towards the group who's gonna grab it um who's got the i think that's several of us have some intelligence she's got the most charisma in our group
1:44:48: Leopold Magnus: Not me. Yeah, not me. You're wasting this pressure, yeah.
1:44:49: Kaladen Shash: You're wasting this pressure, yeah.
1:44:52: Kaladen Shash: Mine's no advantage.
1:44:54: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, same. I guess, uh... Mine's negative.
1:44:58: Leopold Magnus: Great, so we've got a real good face going.
1:45:08: DM: You take it, and it says, uh, case 22391, assigned to...
1:45:16: DM: uh quotation marks rookies quotation marks uh and it says mission brief over 10 missing people outskirts of town next line reported monsters attacking one casualty next line unclear source organic growth material question mark next line find assess bring back proof
1:46:00: DM: So you are center of all of it.
1:46:04: Leopold Magnus: Okay.
1:46:06: Leopold Magnus: Oh, Kaladin, would you mind if I pour over those files? That looks quite interesting.
1:46:15: Leopold Magnus: Ah, thank you very much.
1:46:17: Kaladen Shash: I would just I would just begin walking I would just assume that as soon as we got the mission that everyone would be like Okay, that's the task What are you both coming
1:46:30: Leopold Magnus: I'm, I'm just like looking through these papers, kind of taking it all in, uh, kind of like a tiny piece of paper in my hand, just really close to my eyes. And I go, Oh yes.
1:46:40: Leopold Magnus: This seems like quite the task. I suppose you two gents are going to need some help from Leopold. Yes, we'd all go.
1:46:59: DM: Alrighty.
1:47:01: DM: you guys.
1:47:05: DM: The Domewall Legionnaire have special access tunnels, so you just head down the south wall that sort of splits the Amberfields and the Storm District together.
1:47:13: DM: And there's an exit door through one of them.
1:47:19: DM: As you approach the door, an arcane flash goes off on your armor piece and the door flashes green, letting you know that it's open.
1:47:29: DM: And you push your way out
1:47:31: DM: and you step into the rainy streets, um, Cowden, you throw up your, so like cerulean azure blue hood that sort of sits over like half your face, obscuring your eyes, but leaving like partial nose down to the chin exposed.
1:47:49: DM: Nice.
1:47:51: DM: I don't know if
1:47:54: DM: Uh, you other two want to have hoods or something, or how are you going to stay out of the rain? But as you make your way, uh, you do realize that the mission folder doesn't have much more information.
1:48:02: DM: So this is like first mission right off the gate.
1:48:05: DM: You're like, oh, well, shit.
1:48:08: DM: We know nothing.
1:48:10: Kaladen Shash: So we're just, we only know that there's 10 missing people and it's in the Eastern people.
1:48:15: DM: Some sort of creatures reported seem to be like.
1:48:24: DM: Organic growth like plant creatures of some kind and was there any information on time of day?
1:48:30: Kaladen Shash: When the fatality occurred or at least when the other people went missing It says like as you're reading the details of those It's just like last couple days reports come in all at the same time so like
1:48:48: DM: if they have a hard time differentiating exactly when it happens, because like the missing persons reports go out a couple of days after they're filed kind of deal.
1:48:51: DM: But it seems like it's been happening over like a couple of weeks at least.
1:49:02: Leopold Magnus: Is this in the storm district?
1:49:04: DM: Yeah, just sort of like southeastern portion of the storm district.
1:49:12:  Zariel Torgan: Oh, I think I just say, oh,  Well, I imagine we should probably go talk to some people, get some more information.
1:49:30:  Zariel Torgan: And I think neither Leopold nor I, we're not familiar with any of this at all, right? This is all like novel.
1:49:40: DM: Yeah. I mean, you know of them, but  None of you would really have been like, Oh yeah, I go to the Southeastern portion of the storm district.
1:49:40:  Zariel Torgan: I mean, you know of them, but
1:49:49: Leopold Magnus: Yeah. Okay.
1:49:51: Leopold Magnus: So, uh, is it, it's fairly windy and stormy and rainy, right?
1:49:55: DM: Not necessarily windy, but just always a little rainy. Okay.
1:49:58: DM: Patches of clear skies, but pretty uncommon.
1:49:59: Leopold Magnus: Patches of clear skies, but pretty uncommon.
1:50:02: Leopold Magnus: I mean, are gusts of wind happening intermittently?
1:50:07: Leopold Magnus: You won't set wind?
1:50:07: DM: No, nothing like crazy. Nothing crazy? Not like storming, storming.
1:50:09: Leopold Magnus: Nothing crazy? Not like storming, storming.
1:50:11: Leopold Magnus: Right, but like fluttering maybe?
1:50:14: DM: Yeah. Okay. Please tell me there's wind.
1:50:17: Leopold Magnus: So I suppose Leopold would just kind of be engrossed in the folders walking out ahead of you and I'm kind of cloaked with this brown robe that I pull up over my helm to shield me from the rain.
1:50:34: Leopold Magnus: And as you're walking behind me, the wind is fluttering my cape and you can see that there is an emblem on the back of my suit of armor.
1:50:45: Leopold Magnus: Can't quite make it out.
1:50:49:  Zariel Torgan: I'll clock that for later. Put it in my notebook.
1:51:01: DM: Yeah, you guys make your way down. Somebody go ahead, or multiple people, give me investigation checks.
1:51:05: DM: If you want to talk to, like, local population and civilians, give me persuasion checks.
1:51:14: DM: If you're just trying to notice things out of the ordinary, it can be a perception. Just sort of give me a check that would be reasonably justifiable.
1:51:23:  Zariel Torgan: I'll look around. I'll give you an investigation check.
1:51:28: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, I also would, would do that. So I can, uh, I can assist if that's helpful.
1:51:35: Kaladen Shash: Yes, I'll go with advantage. That might be helpful.
1:51:41: Leopold Magnus: I guess I was looking around for maybe, um, like a market area or, or some, somewhere where people might congregate and tell stories.
1:51:55: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, or have like missing person flyers, where there'd be like a common board where we might be able to go ask family members or something like that.
1:52:00: Kaladen Shash: Exactly, yeah.
1:52:03: DM: Common boards don't really exist anymore kind of here, but you do like, go to like a open market space and sort of be like, you know, Legionnaire on official business, have you heard of this kind of deal?
1:52:13: DM: Or if you're trying to play it casual, you can just be like, hey, have you heard anything about that? Just like, your angle's entirely up to you.
1:52:24: DM: But on a 22, you do find some people who are like, oh yeah, I heard so-and-so off of this street, his cousin went missing, or I heard that like a creature came up from the sewer and grabbed a guy straight off his bike.
1:52:43: DM: Or somebody else goes, yeah, I'm pretty sure it was that old lady.
1:52:47: DM: Oh, what's her name?
1:52:53: DM: You know, for the life of me, I can't remember, but I think she lives in the southeastern portion of town.
1:52:59: DM: Not a lot of specific leads, but enough stories corroborate where you're like, okay, everybody kind of knows there's something going on.
1:53:06: DM: There is an underlying air of fear, but nobody's really giving you any answers right away.
1:53:12: DM: A 22 is good though. So I will say it takes you a long time, but eventually you sort of narrow it down
1:53:21: DM: And you're like over here in the city, just like outskirts, outer buildings.
1:53:28: DM: And finally you find like a little like shorter gentleman balding on the top with a huge bushy beard, hitting like an arcane vape outside of a club.
1:53:41: DM: And he's just like, it's like late afternoon, early evening. You guys have sort of been on your feet all day. And he's just like, well,
1:53:50: DM: shit what's it called uh it's that one lady's shop uh her name is something salvage sylvia anyway uh this is where you want to go look for it and he pulls up his map and it sort of projects up from a bracelet just general outlay of the town and he sort of gives you a pinpointed
1:54:08: DM: spots and uh check on this street you'll you'll miss it it's got her name on the building okay i think i'll just uh say well well if it's uh something in the sewer we can't do it because we don't want to get a bad nickname like that one guy oh sorry oh the sewers weren't that bad
1:54:48:  Zariel Torgan: yeah i guess a fucking legend i see maybe i was uh a little too judgmental somebody should tell you uh don't judge a book by its cover you know i've heard that i've heard that lately and i have not taken it to heart that's my fault
1:55:16: Leopold Magnus: Well, Quine, sir, thank you very much for all this information.
1:55:29:  Zariel Torgan: So we got the street and the name of her place.
1:55:35:  Zariel Torgan: Yep. So you know, her name probably starts with like two S's.
1:55:35: DM: So you know, her name probably starts with like two S's.
1:55:40:  Zariel Torgan: So do we start canvassing? Do you guys think we should just like each take a street and a grid and start just walking it down? Or do you want to ask?
1:55:51: Leopold Magnus: I think that maybe we could ask around. I mean, her shop is fairly obvious, right? It has her name on it.
1:55:58: Leopold Magnus: We already know where it is on the map.
1:56:01:  Zariel Torgan: I'm sure it must be a sign.
1:56:04:  Zariel Torgan: Okay, I thought that's where we were on the map.
1:56:06:  Zariel Torgan: Okay. All right, then let's head down there This street and it's not her name in the building.
1:56:13:  Zariel Torgan: Gotcha. All right. Yeah. Yeah, I say we head down there Let's roll nice you guys make your way down it doesn't take you too long But eventually you come up to a
1:56:30: DM: Uh, like little wood shack. It's very cute.
1:56:35: DM: Uh, it's got like flowers hanging from like the banisters and the overhangs got like little bird houses and stuff and then painted on and really cute handwriting on the front sign says Selena Sal.
1:56:56:  Zariel Torgan: Nice.
1:57:02: DM: Looking through the window, just sort of peeking in, it's a, and as I said earlier, I didn't bring it up for no reason, it's a potion shop.
1:57:19:  Zariel Torgan: Does it seem to be open and bustling, or does it seem to be more closed up and not very well traveled?
1:57:28:  Zariel Torgan: There's not a lot of people going in. There's a close sign outside, but you turn the door handle and it's unlocked.
1:57:31: DM: There's a close sign outside, but you turn the door handle and it's unlocked. There's dust covering the windows, but you see light from the inside. You're getting a lot of mixed messages.
1:57:44: Leopold Magnus: Um, so I kind of walk up to one of the shelves that's covered in dust in an attempt to read one of the potion names. I blow a large jet of compressed air across the shelf. Stop you there before you get too cool with it.
1:57:55: DM: Stop you there before you get too cool with it. You guys haven't entered the shop yet. You went inside?
1:57:57: Leopold Magnus: You guys haven't entered the shop yet.
1:57:59: DM: Yeah, yeah. I was gonna say, I didn't think we... Oh, you hadn't gone inside?
1:57:59: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, yeah. I was gonna say, I didn't think we... Oh, you hadn't gone inside?
1:58:01: Leopold Magnus: Oh, okay. I thought we were inside the shop. We just could see into it right now.
1:58:02:  Zariel Torgan: Oh, okay.
1:58:02: Kaladen Shash: I thought we were inside the shop.
1:58:06: Leopold Magnus: I see, I see.
1:58:07:  Zariel Torgan: Can I crack the door and just peek inside and see what I can see?
1:58:13: DM: Yeah, just...
1:58:14: DM: and then you get a doorbell above your head goes off and you look inside and shelved to shell wall to wall just clutter potions just cups of water buckets full of random knickknacks like dirt piled up to one floor you see a cat run out in front of you to the other side underneath the table a really
1:58:43: DM: weirdly high counter to begin with and then you hear just hello is anybody there and you see just like a bob of hair bouncing up and down as this little figure walks up behind the counter and she pops up over the top and you see this incredibly old looking women woman who looks lost she's got enormous goggles of glasses that make her eyes incredibly tiny
1:59:07: DM: Her hair is a mess, like she tried to style it a week ago. Half of it's like up in a bun, the other half is just loose and wild.
1:59:21: DM: She's got like flowers in it.
1:59:23: DM: She wears a long, boxy, like a muumuu type dress that has like patchwork flowers sewn on it. And she's got like flip-flop sandals, and just like various bottles and stuff tied to her hip.
1:59:39: DM: She goes, is there anybody there?
2:00:02: Kaladen Shash: My name is Calvin.
2:00:07: Kaladen Shash: Nice to meet you all.
2:00:55: Kaladen Shash: Dude, whenever the guy gave us info about go see this person, was it just that she was near the events?
2:01:02: DM: Somebody mentioned that like she had gone missing or something like misinformation, but like This is the right part of town and you've heard an old woman brought up twice, but this lady seems off her fucking rocker Right.
2:01:14:  Zariel Torgan: I make a check to see if I believe that she's as Inept as she's acting.
2:01:19:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah. What do you think?
2:01:21: Leopold Magnus: Yeah. What do you think?
2:01:23:  Zariel Torgan: I think at this time I'm gonna blow all that dust throughout the shelves to And then yeah
2:01:31: DM: and like potions fall over and things nothing breaks but like bottles roll down he's like rushing to grab them and she just goes hello i'm little kid i'm gonna ask you please don't touch the things if you can't afford to buy it my grandma once told me that if you can't afford to buy things you shouldn't touch them
2:01:51: Leopold Magnus: Oh, dear. Sorry, ma'am. I do apologize. It was my clumsiness that knocked these things over. I am Leopold Magnus, and I very much... Her glasses and her eyes get just a little bit smaller when she does she goes.
2:02:00: DM: Hmm.
2:02:17: Leopold Magnus: Oh, oh, oh, oh.
2:02:18: Leopold Magnus: Well, you know, I spend most of my days in the study. I don't really talk to girls, you know.
2:02:24: Leopold Magnus: So I can't really say I would know how. No, that's fair.
2:02:28: DM: Let me introduce you to another single friend of mine.
2:02:31: DM: She's around here somewhere and like just without even prompting, she turns around and starts walking back down the hall.
2:02:38: DM: You made an insight check of 13 and there's one of 18.
2:02:43: DM: Uh, Zariel, you think she might be fucking with you. Kaladin, you realize she is just weird as hell. Yeah.
2:03:16: DM: And you see her muttering off in a closet, and she comes out, and she walks up to the counter, and she puts a hermit crab on the counter.
2:03:27: DM: And the hermit crab looks at you, Leopold, and goes, what?
2:03:27: Kaladen Shash: And the hermit crab looks at you, Leopold, and goes, what?
2:03:36: Leopold Magnus: You cut out. What did it say?
2:03:38: Leopold Magnus: What did it say? I don't know.
2:03:43: Leopold Magnus: I was just on the really high end.
2:03:45: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, so I'm- Mike wasn't picking it up. I'm kind of juggling, I'm juggling those potions, like, really trying not to drop them, but, like, my mechanical gears keep, like, bouncing them around.
2:03:57: Leopold Magnus: And I go, oh! And I'm kind of stumbling.
2:04:02: Leopold Magnus: And I catch the potion finally.
2:04:11: Leopold Magnus: And in the commotion, my cape kind of gets ripped off, and you can see the emblem a little better.
2:04:18: Leopold Magnus: But the potions, I sit down and go, hi, Marcel.
2:04:20: Leopold Magnus: I look down, and I'm looking at the small hermit crab, and I say, well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. What was it, Marcel?
2:04:37: Leopold Magnus: It's ma'am, thank you.
2:04:39: Leopold Magnus: Okay. Yes, ma'am, Marcelle.
2:04:44: DM: Marcelle, you talk way too much. Let the guy get a nice word in.
2:05:19: DM: It's probably better that they're not here right now.
2:05:29: DM: And then the other day I had some kids that sort of walked through my shop and they weren't being very responsive to me, but I told them to get out of my shop.
2:05:43: Kaladen Shash: Would we know the names of the 10 missing people with our mission brief?
2:05:58: DM: Yeah, once she just goes on another talking tangent about Marcel and Soda totally fully dissociates, you can have a full conversation if you'd like.
2:06:09:  Zariel Torgan: I think she might be turning these people into things. I think she might be the bad guy.
2:06:19:  Zariel Torgan: That crab talked.
2:06:21:  Zariel Torgan: I've never seen that happen before.
2:06:23: Leopold Magnus: I'm just talking to Marcel in a very engrossed conversation.
2:06:29: Leopold Magnus: I think we might be hitting it off.
2:06:36: Leopold Magnus: So Marcel, what do you get up to on the weekends?
2:06:51: Leopold Magnus: Yes, indeed.
2:06:56: Leopold Magnus: Um, well, ever since I got put into this beast of a body, I haven't really been thinking like myself anymore, but it is quite operational.
2:07:07: DM: Like me and my late husband were married for four years before he left me and took my money, but I got the business.
2:07:26: DM: Do you have some way of testing this hypothesis?
2:07:38:  Zariel Torgan: We could see who the crab is supposed to be.
2:07:42:  Zariel Torgan: But it might behoove us to maybe check around some of the back areas here.
2:07:52:  Zariel Torgan: Do a little bit of reconnaissance.
2:07:56: Kaladen Shash: Certainly.
2:08:00: Kaladen Shash: Can we keep using, is she like totally distracted still with her conversation with Leo and the crab?
2:08:08: Kaladen Shash: Right now she's just staring straight forward, but you can't tell where she's looking because her eyes are too small to really like, to tell direction.
2:08:15: DM: Okay.
2:08:21: DM: Large, slow blinks. She's very content.
2:08:25: DM: It's nice being company.
2:08:51: Leopold Magnus: I think I think I'm very thankful for you introducing me to Marcel to be honest quite the And I'm kind of showing off to Marcel and I kind of like flexing a little bit I'm just kind of showing off my armor.
2:09:05: Leopold Magnus: I'm like I
2:09:16: Leopold Magnus: You know, like I've found, I've found a little bit of confidence that maybe Leopold never had before. And he's kind of like showing off a little bit, but in a very clumsy way.
2:09:27: Leopold Magnus: Watch that crab cake.
2:09:29: Leopold Magnus: And so you kind of flip around and his cape is.
2:09:39: Leopold Magnus: But when, and he's doing his muscle show, you flip around and the cape is kind of twisted around his helm. So it's, it's fully exposing his back plate.
2:09:46: Leopold Magnus: And on the back of the armor is a large iron gauntlet crushing a human skull. The gauntlet is adorned with sharp spikes and gears, and there's just bone dust and teeth shattered beneath it. And on the top of  the, it looks like a 70s biker jacket. And on the top of that emblem is just the name emblazoned bone grinder.
2:10:19: Leopold Magnus: And I'm just like carelessly flexing and kind of showing off to Marcel.
2:10:26: Leopold Magnus: It's unsettling.
2:10:30:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah.
2:10:33:  Zariel Torgan: I'll just circle back to that in a second.
2:10:37:  Zariel Torgan: I thought you were going to say, like, made in China or something. That would be excellent.
2:10:47: Kaladen Shash: Selena, where do your employees live? Where were they walking to or from?
2:10:52: Kaladen Shash: How long have they been missing?
2:11:55: Kaladen Shash: Yeah.
2:11:58: Kaladen Shash: I just turn around.
2:12:00: Kaladen Shash: I don't know what to do.
2:12:03:  Zariel Torgan: I'm just gonna pull him to the side like, well, I think my, she's the bad guy thing might be mistaken. I think this might be a colossal waste of time. We might need to go try somewhere else.
2:12:33: DM: What do you have? How much are they?
2:12:35: DM: We don't have money. I've got some nice aromatics for if you're on a date.
2:12:54: DM: I've got some random ones if you want to talk to specifically a cat for an hour.
2:13:01: DM: What else do I got?
2:13:02: DM: If you want to float off the ground for 13 seconds, I haven't got the duration of that one right yet.
2:13:06: DM: 13 seconds?
2:13:12: Kaladen Shash: Two rounds? Yep. No, we're fine.
2:13:13: DM: Yep. No, we're fine.
2:13:40: Leopold Magnus: I haven't really noticed what what they're doing and I feel like I
2:13:47: Leopold Magnus: Maybe when I see them step out, I kind of go, oh my, I do have to go, excuse me.
2:13:53: Leopold Magnus: But there's one thing.
2:14:11: Leopold Magnus: Oh, okay. Very interesting. Yes, indeed. If you don't mind.
2:14:17: DM: Okay, what's this price saying? She holds the bottle up to her glasses until the glass touches the glass.
2:14:23: DM: She's okay, that'll be 15 gold.
2:14:37: Leopold Magnus: Well, this is the shell friend of yours, of course.
2:14:47: Leopold Magnus: Yes, of course. You've insisted she is. And I will take her out for a date. I'm starting to realize that the shell maybe is a little bit of not my type.
2:14:57: Leopold Magnus: After a little bit more conversation, you know, she's like really too into me and I'm trying to get out of it. But I'm willing to, I'm willing to appease this lady and take the shell on a date because I don't have any money and I want the potion.
2:15:12: DM: Pick it up. Here's your receipt. And she gives you a receipt that says you paid already. A little paper, hands you the potion.
2:15:19: DM: Okay, stop. Just sit now with the rhino powder.
2:15:27: Leopold Magnus: Well, thank you very much. It's been a very nice pleasure chatting to both of you. And I will see you for our date later, Marcel. Okay.
2:15:41: Leopold Magnus: I'm gonna try and back out of the shop without knocking anything over.
2:15:47: DM: You guys step out and it's night time, you've been in there a long time.
2:15:47: Leopold Magnus: You guys step out and it's night time, you've been in there a long time.
2:15:51: Kaladen Shash: Shit.
2:15:56: Kaladen Shash: Um, can, from this area of the hut, or up to the wall of the dome, do we see any unusual, like you said, it's an organic beast, you said, or monster?
2:16:09: Kaladen Shash: that seems to be plant-based?
2:16:13: DM: Uh, from what you got, that was the report, but you don't see, like, anything in particular.
2:16:16: DM: I mean, there's, like, little roadside parks with trees here and there, like, it's... it's not uncommon.
2:16:23: DM: Okay.
2:16:34:  Zariel Torgan: Do we see any access points to the sewer, like any manhole covers or any drainage ditch things?
2:16:42: DM: Weirdly enough, not in this portion of the city. The farther you go out, the least modernized it is. So like, running sewer and arcane magic flow is sort of rare to have on the outer parts.
2:17:00:  Zariel Torgan: Gotcha, where does the rainwater from the storms divert to is there just ditches? Until they finally do me up with the silver system.
2:17:04: DM: Until they finally do me up with the silver system.
2:17:09:  Zariel Torgan: Gotcha. Okay So, can we investigate are we out like kind of in an alley You're just in a road it's getting dark people are rushing to and from but it's less popular in general and
2:17:27: DM: There's like, you can hear club music off in the distance of like something really loud.
2:17:31: DM: And then like, but nothing else is happening at this moment in time.
2:17:42: Leopold Magnus: Okay. Um, and was there anything around this old lady shop? It's just kind of a standard.
2:17:50: Leopold Magnus: row our houses.
2:17:50: DM: You guys haven't checked yet, but feel free to, if you want to look around. Yeah. I'll just kind of look in the, in the general area.
2:17:54: Leopold Magnus: I'll just kind of look in the, in the general area. I guess I'm kind of scanning the buildings and maybe looking for signs of a disturbance, like maybe some bricks that are damaged.
2:18:06: Leopold Magnus: I don't know, maybe some pavers that are upturned or shattered, something that maybe could have been from an impact or, or you know, like a heavy creature running maybe.
2:18:16:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah, I'll join him in that. I want to look for signs of struggle or something like that.
2:18:24: DM: Leo sounded more like you were looking for something perceptively. You're just scanning.
2:18:29: DM: Azariel, are you also just trying to observe or are you looking for something specific?
2:18:34:  Zariel Torgan: I'm just trying to observe. I don't know a specific enough of an area to do a specific little look in a specific spot.
2:18:43: DM: Two perception checks or one with advantage?
2:18:48: Leopold Magnus: What's your perception? My perception is zero. I was hoping to do an investigation of some kind, but if that's perception then you're probably best to roll it.
2:18:48:  Zariel Torgan: What's your perception?
2:18:57: Leopold Magnus: Perception is walking into a room and what you take in right away.
2:18:58: DM: Perception is walking into a room and what you take in right away. Investigation is if you like look at the books on the wall.
2:19:05: Leopold Magnus: Got it. Okay. Something more specific.
2:19:06: DM: Give me a specific thing. You did mention some specific things at the end, but you kept using the words like I want to scan or.
2:19:14: DM: Okay.
2:19:16: Leopold Magnus: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I guess I'm looking specifically for signs of a heavy creature or fighting and damaging brick on the building or something.
2:19:26: DM: Give me an investigation then.
2:19:31: DM: Not great.
2:19:36: DM: 13. 13 and 10. You don't really find anything in the area matching sort of what you're looking for.
2:19:48: DM: You're not entirely sure.
2:19:51:  Zariel Torgan: Are there any people out on the street or if while it's dark or is it pretty well vacated?
2:19:57: DM: At this time I'm gonna say it's pretty well vacated just because there's not Unless you go find somebody with a good check.
2:20:02: DM: I'm not just gonna Be like, oh, yeah, here's your deus ex machina Okay I mean, we're the approximate district of the city that These disappearances were reported, right?
2:20:18: DM: Yes, you do know you're in the right area. Got it How are the way to go?
2:20:23: Kaladen Shash: Go ahead
2:20:25: Kaladen Shash: Let's see, what other shops are next to Selena's doll's person shop?
2:20:31: Kaladen Shash: There's some broken down stuff.
2:20:33: DM: You see like a clothing store, abandoned building, somebody's house, little like furniture store rugs, things like that, textiles, somebody else's house.
2:20:42: DM: Down at the very end of the street, you do see like a line of people waiting.  to get into what looks to be like a bar of some kind.
2:20:57: DM: Sort of just getting ID'd before they step in.
2:21:06:  Zariel Torgan: Maybe we could go talk to them.
2:21:15: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, I was gonna say the bouncer or just people in line that may have been out in about the last few nights.
2:21:15:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah, I was gonna say the bouncer or just people in line that may have been out in about the last few nights.
2:21:22: Leopold Magnus: As you guys start making your way down the street, I'm going to have Leopold give me a luck check.
2:21:22: DM: As you guys start making your way down the street, I'm going to have Leopold give me a luck check.
2:21:35: DM: And then Kaladin, give me a perception check for just you. Hold on.
2:21:50: DM: Oh, mine didn't update. Hold on, let me reload.
2:21:55: DM: 15. Uh, don't see anything. Just walking towards the bar.
2:22:01: Kaladen Shash: Oh, no shadow. No shadows again following me. I don't know.
2:22:06: Kaladen Shash: It's a little darker today.
2:22:10: Leopold Magnus: Uh, Leopold, what did you get?
2:22:16: Leopold Magnus: I was gonna do one more thing before you guys talk to the people online though.
2:22:22: Leopold Magnus: or I guess concurrent with when you're doing that. I was going to come wander off and just peer through the windows of that abandoned building and see if there's any evidence of like maybe people being in there recently.
2:22:39: Leopold Magnus: 11.
2:22:40: Leopold Magnus: Doesn't seem like it.
2:22:42: DM: Dusty window, dark inside, don't see any movement. Seems pretty abandoned.
2:22:50: DM: Okay, right on.
2:22:57:  Zariel Torgan: Are you going to make your way over here? Oh, go ahead.
2:23:00:  Zariel Torgan: Sorry.
2:23:02: DM: No, that that's you guys make it there. Do you want to do something as you get there?
2:23:08:  Zariel Torgan: I guess I would just try to make us look a little, you know, uh, professional as presentable as we can. I'm probably not going to be the guy that speaks, but I just want to put myself together a little bit. Okay.
2:23:21: Kaladen Shash: Yeah. Is this like, are we talking like velvet rope action right now?
2:23:23: Kaladen Shash: Or is it like a little bit more,
2:23:26: Kaladen Shash: Open, can we like walk right up to the, can we walk right up to the bouncer?
2:23:29: DM: Everybody give me a quick perception check as you're walking up to see what kind of bar you're getting into.
2:23:39: Kaladen Shash: Ugh, almost good.
2:23:40: Kaladen Shash: We're still on that 15. I'm giving you guys chances, you know.
2:23:41: DM: We're still on that 15.
2:23:42: DM: I know, you really are. You really, really are.
2:23:44: Kaladen Shash: I know, you really are. You really, really are.
2:23:47: DM: Get them out, you know.
2:23:49: DM: That's the point.
2:23:52: DM: Before anything, you hear the music.
2:23:57: DM: it's like pretty intense fast pace like norse influence like scandinavian equivalent like like house like it's crazy it's like chanting but with like musical background uh like you can hear it sounds like a fiddle attached to like an arcane amp to give it like more of an electric sound and this is all from the outside
2:24:28: DM: as you're like standing in line you notice everybody around you is wearing like a large amount of leather and they've got like metal piercings all over their lips like grill fangs so they're just like glued onto their front teeth alternative hair face makeup that's like intentionally put on to run down their face like this is like an underground bar
2:25:00:  Zariel Torgan: Correct.
2:25:01: Leopold Magnus: Interesting.
2:25:06: Leopold Magnus: Wait, what's going on here? This is quite the establishment, isn't it, Zariel?
2:25:13:  Zariel Torgan: Yes, I think we might need to blend in. So, uh, act real cool-like.
2:25:20: Leopold Magnus: Okay, indeed I will act cool.
2:25:24: Leopold Magnus: How does one act cool, Zariel?
2:25:28:  Zariel Torgan: Just watch me.
2:25:31:  Zariel Torgan: and I'm gonna hop in line and just kind of try to casually talk to whoever's in front. I'm not sure who the next person in line is.
2:25:45:  Zariel Torgan: Are they- You see like a three and a half foot tall, pretty stout, like dwarven heritage type deal, like thick, full red hair, but they've got like,
2:25:50: DM: vampire fangs on they're like made of plastic so they turn like stuff you wouldn't mind to get into yeah something like that i was uh wondering if i could pick your brain a little about some uh missing people yeah people that have been uh missing recently i don't take too kindly to that kind of behavior
2:26:26:  Zariel Torgan: What can you tell me?
2:26:32:  Zariel Torgan: Uh, yeah, but I'll take it later. Uh... Right now, could you tell me about what you got going on? Come find me, sweetheart.
2:26:42:  Zariel Torgan: Huh?
2:26:47:  Zariel Torgan: Oh.
2:26:48:  Zariel Torgan: Uh... Definitely.
2:26:49:  Zariel Torgan: Uh, yeah.  With that, perhaps you know a little more about the details of these disappearances?
2:27:02:  Zariel Torgan: I mean, I don't know as much as some people, but I know some things.
2:27:17:  Zariel Torgan: What's he indicating towards?
2:27:20: DM: Back the way you came, towards that shop.
2:27:23:  Zariel Torgan: Is it the steps to steps to the shop?
2:27:26: DM: You can't tell from here. Oh, okay.
2:27:28:  Zariel Torgan: Alright. Is there multiple buildings with steps? That way.
2:27:30: DM: That way.
2:27:32: DM: Yeah, all of them are sort of like on raised decks and stuff.
2:27:35:  Zariel Torgan: Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Don't want them to flood.
2:27:36: DM: Don't want them to flood.
2:27:38:  Zariel Torgan: Mm-hmm.
2:27:40:  Zariel Torgan: Okay.
2:27:46:  Zariel Torgan: Well, maybe you'd be able to tell my friend here  a little bit more and I indicate towards Kaladin because he's obviously more hip than I am.
2:28:02: DM: Shuck, beautiful, can I help you?
2:28:58: DM: Go ahead and give me an insight check as he speaks.
2:29:16: DM: 13 as he's speaking you can tell he's sort of cutting off information that like a 13 is fine on a normal person that like maybe his boss told him like hey don't scare people away like it's cool to mention that it's a somewhat dangerous area but if they found out for example that somebody was kidnapped down the street that might scare business away
2:29:44: DM: So he's talking, and he goes, yeah, it's a pretty intense neighborhood.
2:29:49: DM: Can I ask why you're asking?
2:30:02: Leopold Magnus: And I just lean in and go, Leopold Magnus, at your service. And I shoot my mechanical arm out.
2:30:12: Kaladen Shash: As he's reaching across, I would pull out whatever our identification is that we have now as new recruits or whatever.
2:30:22: Kaladen Shash: Or point to an emblem.
2:30:22: DM: Or point to an emblem.
2:30:24: DM: Raises his voice considerably, but he goes, oh, the guards are here.
2:30:29: DM: Yeah, guys, I don't have too much more information if I'm being completely honest, but yeah, about a week ago,
2:30:42: DM: So you guys asked for about a single creature. I don't know who you got your information of.
2:30:48: DM: What I saw was like, they look like dogs almost, like little quadrupedal creatures of some kind, but they always, I saw them a couple of times, but sometimes they're just like running up an alley or something.
2:31:19: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, do they know anyone of the missing people?
2:31:23: DM: No, it just always seems to be like some unhoused folk here and there.
2:31:30: DM: Orphan goes missing because they're begging too long on the street. Nobody abhors.
2:31:39:  Zariel Torgan: I'm gonna attempt to pull Kaladin to the side momentarily.
2:31:47:  Zariel Torgan: Maybe we should- The guard starts inquiring to Leopold just casually about his armor and what the fuck he is.
2:31:53: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, I'm gonna try to look cool, quote-unquote.
2:31:59: Leopold Magnus: You feel a hand caress your butt grieve.
2:32:03: DM: And that little dwarf with the fangs goes,
2:32:08: DM: You like a dumb or a sub or what?
2:32:12: Leopold Magnus: Well, um, uh, I'm not quite sure what you mean, but, um, well, I do say, um... You're going to be awoken and he pulls you into the bar with him.
2:32:13: DM: Well, um, uh, I'm not quite sure what you mean, but, um, well, I do say, um... You're going to be awoken and he pulls you into the bar with him.
2:32:20: DM: We're gonna fucking party.
2:32:26: Leopold Magnus: A party? Well, Azariel did say act cool, and, um, I suppose acting cool does mean partying, so, um, okay, let's go then.
2:32:38: DM: We'll get to you in a second, as you guys are having a conversation.
2:32:43:  Zariel Torgan: I'm just gonna say to Kaladin, perhaps we should dress ourselves up as the person destitute.
2:32:51:  Zariel Torgan: Perhaps it's some sort of bait. I think we might be able to lead this thing to us.
2:33:04:  Zariel Torgan: I don't know. Maybe we should ask Leopold.
2:33:13: DM: For somebody who's 6'11", you lose them a lot.
2:33:16: DM: But Leopold, this is not like, uh, intentionally pull you into a sidetrack to get you in nature. You get pulled into this rave, essentially. There's, like, people with, like, wolf furs and stuff, and, like, arcane glow sticks.
2:33:28: DM: There's flashing lights on the ceiling of, like, lenses switching back and forth over fortresses and stuff. People are taking, like, neon shots and drinks. There's, like,  partial orgies happening in the court like this is a lot and you're like what the fuck oh my this is something else what did you call this event again it's a good time here and he puts like something in your palm and then he does like a weird squid motion as he backstep moon walks into a dance crowd and you don't see him again i kind of inspect whatever he handed to me it's like a little
2:34:10: DM: small film that you can sort of see through it's got a little like animal colored on the front of it hmm interesting um and i'm just lost in a sea of people yeah there's people like grinding on you girls talking to you but the music's so loud that they can't really hear what they're saying there's like
2:34:33: DM: You think I'm a hot, you know, just anything kind of deal. And eventually you get like tugged on the back where your torn cloak is as your like teammates pull you back out.
2:34:44: Leopold Magnus: Okay. Yeah. So in the midst of, of all of that, my cloak has, has been lost. Um, and so you're just seeing a towering six 11 suit of armor with horns and the, uh, the bone crusher emblem on the back of the, uh, the shoulders there.
2:35:02:  Zariel Torgan: I we definitely need to get him some like bumper stickers.
2:35:07:  Zariel Torgan: Like, you know, I break for this, you know, just stick them on there.
2:35:12: Kaladen Shash: We've got the comms in our, our armor, right? I'd be like, what are you pulled?
2:35:16: Kaladen Shash: What are you doing? Uh, he's back out there with you now.
2:35:22: Leopold Magnus: Oh yeah. Yeah. We grabbed him.
2:35:22: Leopold Magnus: All right.
2:35:26: Leopold Magnus: Oh dear, Zariel. Acting cool is not quite my thing. That was a little bit too much for me, to be honest.
2:35:38:  Zariel Torgan: I'll, uh, fill him in on the plan.
2:35:41:  Zariel Torgan: Who would you, uh, will?
2:35:44:  Zariel Torgan: Who would like to be our bait?
2:35:48:  Zariel Torgan: I don't suppose it'd be you, Leo. You're a bit intimidating for whatever this creature is.
2:35:55: Leopold Magnus: Intimidating? I suppose if you do say. Yes, I'd rather not be the bait. What are your guys' passive perceptions?
2:36:03: Kaladen Shash: I was gonna say, that might be a good way to look at that. Fifteen.
2:36:06:  Zariel Torgan: I was gonna say, you should be... Ten.
2:36:13: DM: Fifteen, ten. Tell it what's your passive. Fourteen.
2:36:14: Kaladen Shash: Tell it what's your passive. Fourteen.
2:36:16: Kaladen Shash: Fourteen, so plus two.
2:36:19: DM: uh you guys are having this conversation and you hear like scuffling tiny bit pretty far off and then you hear a hey he's got me oh help and some guys just start screaming and then you look and you see it almost too late but you see just like dark figures the very end sort of near the wall and they're like
2:36:47: DM: grabbing a dude by his heels and his feet like pulling losing grip grabbing pulling again and sure shit enough they're like dragging him up the stairs of the potion shop fireball but you guys at this point are like 300 feet away well so you started on a dead sprint but mechanically you guys understand that out of character what this means is that
2:37:17: DM: timeline was missed you're not going to have a great time following them but you do at least have a location because they rolled an 18, natural 20, 15, and a 9 on stealth checks so one of them made enough noise to be noticed.
2:37:38: DM: Four what you do see to be confirmed like small quadrupedal type creatures dragging somebody into this building.
2:37:48:  Zariel Torgan: It's a swarm of rats. Every D&D campaign starts fighting a swarm of rats.
2:37:56: Leopold Magnus: All right.
2:37:56:  Zariel Torgan: I kind of look at them.
2:37:57: Leopold Magnus: I kind of look at them. Did you folks see that?
2:38:00:  Zariel Torgan: Did you folks see that? Full movement. I'm just going.
2:38:05: Kaladen Shash: Yep.
2:38:07: Leopold Magnus: I'm trying to keep up.
2:38:09: Kaladen Shash: Are we all 30, 35? Yeah. 30. Yep.
2:38:15: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, we're just good. Just all keep up with each other.
2:38:19: Kaladen Shash: 60 feet around, so we need five rounds. You said it's 300 feet off.
2:38:25: Kaladen Shash: So we're 30 seconds behind them. I'm just testifying that, so to say, like, you guys are gonna get to the building, and I'm just letting you know, out of game, you're not gonna see these creatures, because they will have enough time to have gotten away, but you do have a direction.
2:38:26: DM: I'm just testifying that, so to say, like, you guys are gonna get to the building, and I'm just letting you know, out of game, you're not gonna see these creatures, because they will have enough time to have gotten away, but you do have a direction.
2:38:40: Kaladen Shash: Yep.
2:38:42: Kaladen Shash: Yep.
2:38:43: Kaladen Shash: But we saw them going up the stairs to try to essentially go into the shop.
2:38:48: DM: Yes, you know where they're going because one of them failed the stealth check. You just because you failed the initial check while in the building initially, you or you didn't look in the right spot.
2:39:00: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, race. I raised a very difficult character in front of you.
2:39:00: DM: I raised a very difficult character in front of you. You guys didn't get sort of the early jump to this.
2:39:08: Kaladen Shash: Kick the door down.
2:39:08: DM: Kick the door down.
2:39:09: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, just race right into this job.
2:39:11: DM: Sprinting down the street, your feet pounding on the cobbled stone, the rain sort of slapping as you hit. You up this stairs, dum-da-dum, kick the door down. Looking around panicked, you see disturbed bottles. There's like a trail of water pulling into the back. And as you're like in this panic state, you do hear, very casually,
2:39:36: DM: I'll be down in a moment, don't worry, I've got a few needs, it's a little late though, don't you think to be buying some potions?"
2:39:44: DM: But then you guys are like, what the fuck, and you keep looking. Let me know where you're looking, what you're looking for, and give me some checks to correspond.
2:39:57:  Zariel Torgan: I want to follow the wet  thing that appears like the guy got dragged in front of the rain. I want to see where that goes, and I want to look that way and try to follow it.
2:40:11: Kaladen Shash: I'm going to walk up. I want to follow where the lady's voice is coming from.
2:40:12:  Zariel Torgan: I want to follow where the lady's voice is coming from.
2:40:16: DM: You guys are both heading the same direction initially.
2:40:19: DM: The water drag mark goes down the hall to the left, and when you hit there, you realize it's a storeroom.
2:40:25: DM: You follow the sound of Selena down the hall to the right up the stairs to like a living
2:40:33: Leopold Magnus: I'll go with Kaladin.
2:40:37: Leopold Magnus: I'll let Zaryl, I'll let him know that I think Kaladin might need some backup here.
2:40:48: Leopold Magnus: I'll say, Kaladin, I think you'll need some backup.
2:40:51: Leopold Magnus: Let me tell you, my experience with Marcel, like, oh my goodness.
2:40:57: Leopold Magnus: I'll help you out. Leopold's becoming a talker too.
2:40:57: DM: Leopold's becoming a talker too.
2:41:02: DM: Zariel, first you're in the storeroom. The watermarks do sort of peter out. There's like a lot of things knocked over, you can't totally tell, but in this back room is where they lead, but it is currently quiet.
2:41:19:  Zariel Torgan: So we're to assume that they dragged the guy back here. Can I do a perception check to see if there's like any like latches or levers or handles or seams that are just like  Okay, I want to see if there's some hidden thing that I'm not noticing. Uh, 15. Okay, wall 15.
2:41:38: DM: Uh, you don't find any handles or anything like that, but you do find towards the back left wall, there seems to be like a path cleared out, uh, which you can assume is like where a figure was dragged, like through the clutter.
2:41:53: DM: to Kaladin and Leopold, you're rushing up the stairs, feet stomping, and then like meeting you halfway down with like an old-fashioned oil lamp, big glasses not on her face yet, little old Selina just going, don't you touch me now, my old age has earned me a couple extra steps going down the stairs, you know.
2:42:19: Kaladen Shash: So she's not doing anything unusual. That's a bummer.
2:42:21: DM: No, she starts like looking around for her glass. Where did I put those glasses? I can't see without my glasses.
2:42:36: Kaladen Shash: Is there any other rooms beyond just like the storefront and now this upstairs area that we went to?
2:42:44: DM: As far as you can tell, it just looks like living quarters, storefront, stockroom.
2:42:49: Kaladen Shash: And Jesse didn't see, did Jesse roll?
2:42:52: DM: Well, Zariel rolled pretty well.
2:42:53: DM: He has noticed a path at this point, but you guys wouldn't know that yet.
2:42:58: DM: Back to Zariel.
2:43:00: DM: Can I get on, can I get on the mic and just communicate that nothing unusual is going on up here?
2:43:01: Kaladen Shash: Can I get on, can I get on the mic and just communicate that nothing unusual is going on up here?
2:43:08: DM: Absolutely. Being, like Ratchet fully informed you, you speak into the arcane rune on your like left shoulder.
2:43:17: DM: And at normal volume, not lowered or raised or anything, just is the sound of Kaladin being just like all clear.
2:43:29:  Zariel Torgan: Alright, I'm seeing the path and seeing the drag marks. I'm going to Wild Shape into my Dire Wolf form and I'm gonna move as fast as I can towards the
2:43:38:  Zariel Torgan: um thing and and while i'm doing that can i say something before you shift do you want to describe the distance uh well sure yeah i guess if it's i assumed it was a small room but if i see you're gonna hit the wall yeah okay what do i what do i see through there uh it leads to like a toppled over shelf and if you like really investigate it uh
2:44:17: DM: Are you using, like, senses, sight, what are you basing it off of?
2:44:22:  Zariel Torgan: Um, well if it's just a dead end and I can't, like, it's not perception, then I'd probably have to use investigation. Um, which isn't great, but... You want it to, well, shape into a dire wolf.
2:44:33: DM: Yeah. Is that, were there heightened senses?
2:44:33:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah.
2:44:37:  Zariel Torgan: Oh.
2:44:38:  Zariel Torgan: Um, let me check. Or is that just to turn into a wolf for a fight?
2:44:40: DM: Or is that just to turn into a wolf for a fight? What was the logic?
2:44:43:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah, I thought that I was going to be right on top of this thing and I didn't want to get caught off guard.
2:44:50: DM: You transform.
2:44:53: DM: Luckily, you don't get jumped. Unfortunately, there's nothing there, but you do get a whiff of decay.
2:45:04: DM: Like fertilizer. Okay, I do have advantage on any perception with some base checks.
2:45:14:  Zariel Torgan: Go for it.
2:45:15:  Zariel Torgan: Okay.
2:45:25: DM: Finally rolling high enough to get this. It was... I was struggling there guys. Uh, there is... Takes you a little bit to find it because it's like mostly covered up.
2:45:33: DM: But you find like floorboards that are just put back into place.
2:45:41: DM: And there's just a black hole that leads at an angle into the ground.
2:45:48: DM: Cannot tell how deep it is. It is pitch black. So even if you have a version of dark vision or something, it's gray for a while, but then also just fades into nothing.
2:46:00: Leopold Magnus: All right.
2:46:03: Leopold Magnus: So this is a tunnel underground tunnel, just a tunnel that's pretty steep, and it's only about like
2:46:10: DM: a foot and a half to two feet in total diameter all the way around okay um i'm gonna look at them and i'm gonna nod my nose towards the tunnel and i'm gonna um start to slowly walk and watch to see if they follow me yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna go right up to the hole see if
2:46:40: DM: Okay, clarifying for imagery, did a dire wolf put its paw up to its nose and then point at a hole or is it still human form you?
2:46:48:  Zariel Torgan: No, I'm a dire wolf. I'm holding to it. Okay, you guys see a large wolf point to its nose, raise its brows and point at the hole and sneak up on the hole.
2:46:50: DM: Okay, you guys see a large wolf point to its nose, raise its brows and point at the hole and sneak up on the hole.
2:47:01: Leopold Magnus: Is the hole, what, how large was it again?
2:47:04: Leopold Magnus: Like in dimensions? Like two and a half feet in diameter, so like
2:47:10: DM: wider than most people are shoulder to shoulder, but not so big that like, I mean, you absolutely wouldn't fit in it kind of deal.
2:47:20: Leopold Magnus: I'm not, I'm not going to fit through this hole basically.
2:47:23: DM: No.
2:47:24: Leopold Magnus: I see.
2:47:26: DM: Not unless something happens.
2:47:34: Kaladen Shash: Um,  If we peer in, we already know it's so deep we can only see the 60 feet of dark vision.
2:47:41: DM: Yeah, about 60 feet and then you can't see anything else. If you guys have ways of putting light down there, go for it.
2:47:45: Kaladen Shash: If you guys have ways of putting light down there, go for it.
2:47:51: Kaladen Shash: Would I be able to hear anything or see signs of maybe what kind of creatures have been entering or exiting just by sort of seeing claw marks or other sort of marks?
2:48:05: DM: Uh, you do a thorough check. I'm not going to make you roll for it just because the roles on perception haven't been so lucky to you guys.
2:48:10: DM: But, um, you, interestingly enough, with like a pretty thorough search, you see, uh, like what, what looked like human fingerprint, like finger drag marks, like they were calling at the ground not to get pulled away, but there's no other marks.
2:48:34: Kaladen Shash: Okay.
2:48:35: Kaladen Shash: Any sort of unusual smells, just earthy tunnel? Where you get a stronger sense of decay?
2:48:40: Kaladen Shash: A smell of like, you know, normal decaying plants and stuff, fertilizer type smells.
2:48:40: DM: A smell of like, you know, normal decaying plants and stuff, fertilizer type smells.
2:48:42: DM: A strong sense of like waste material.
2:48:50: DM: Not shit, but like when you turn up like a pile of grass trimmings kind of deal.
2:49:00: Leopold Magnus: Jonathan,
2:49:03: Leopold Magnus: If I set a spell that has an effect on the ground, would that trigger if friendlies walked over it? Is that something you can... What is it?
2:49:14: Leopold Magnus: A snare?
2:49:17: DM: You choose the terms of a snare, so you could, in theory, decide who does and doesn't trigger it.
2:49:23: Leopold Magnus: Okay, so I'm going to cast a snare on the base of the tunnel, kind of near its entrance, but maybe a little bit in after Zario enters the tunnel.
2:49:43: DM: Zario, are you entering the tunnel?
2:49:47:  Zariel Torgan: Well, I envisioned that we could all fit, but if we can't all fit, then there's no way for us to be able to fit. We probably just have to wait for it to come out.
2:49:57:  Zariel Torgan: So each of you individually would fit.
2:49:57: DM: It is wide enough for a person to shimmy and not so steep that you would straight fall, but it would be steep.
2:50:07: DM: The only one who would have issues is Leopold unless you can fit something else. I don't believe that as a dire wolf you would fit. Dire wolves are huge.
2:50:16:  Zariel Torgan: Gotcha.
2:50:18:  Zariel Torgan: Well, I guess I could revert back to my form. I've still got another use before a long rest.
2:50:26:  Zariel Torgan: Whale, what do you guys think?
2:50:27: Kaladen Shash: Do you think we should... Does it... Does anyone have any kind of, like, light spells?
2:50:28: Kaladen Shash: I don't have any light spells, like little fairy lights or... I don't have any of that.
2:50:36: Leopold Magnus: I have grease, and I could, uh... I could potentially just shoot a ton of grease down there. We could light it on fire.
2:50:44: Kaladen Shash: Just see how far it goes. I'm fine with that. We'll do a little experiment.
2:50:48: Kaladen Shash: Maybe light. Yeah, go ahead.
2:50:49: Leopold Magnus: Let's make a flaming rock.
2:50:50: Kaladen Shash: Let's make a flaming rock. Make a flaming rock. Cover a rock in grease, we'll light it, and then you can just pitch it down the hole. We'll just see what happens.
2:50:58: Leopold Magnus: Okay, yeah.
2:50:59: Leopold Magnus: That's a good idea.
2:51:00: Leopold Magnus: So I'll cast that snare, and then I will use grease as well.
2:51:10: Leopold Magnus: Wow.
2:51:11: Leopold Magnus: That's not a cantrip.
2:51:13: Leopold Magnus: If I use that, then I won't be able to do any other spells.
2:51:17: Leopold Magnus: None of you have light or anything as a cantrip?
2:51:21: Leopold Magnus: No. I don't even know if that's a cantrip I have available to me.
2:51:27:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah, I don't have light as an option either.
2:51:32: Leopold Magnus: Oh, I do, but I don't have it prepared right now, which is a mistake.
2:51:41: Kaladen Shash: Okay, I haven't don't have some I have like a torture like a Kindle box. Yeah, you guys have basic starter packs up to you've got torches Yeah, I'm just I'm gonna light something and just throw it down the hole.
2:51:49: Kaladen Shash: I want to get a deal for depth Cool, it drops bounces off one wall bounces off the other and about it like 80 feet down you see it hits the ground and sort of lights you can tell because of the way the light reflects like a
2:52:08: DM: A tunnel that's not so open, but not small. Like, if you guys got to the bottom, you could probably stand two people wide, kind of deal.
2:52:17: Kaladen Shash: And do we see any movement?
2:52:19: Leopold Magnus: No.
2:52:21: Leopold Magnus: Does the tunnel seem to end there, or does it continue on? Like, does it branch off?
2:52:25: Leopold Magnus: Hard to say.
2:52:26: DM: Hard to say.
2:52:27: DM: the light seems brighter on the back end of where the torch dropped and it doesn't reflect as hard back on one end. So logically you'd be like, that's where it leads to because there's no wall for the light to bounce off of anyway.
2:52:39: DM: Got it. Yeah.
2:52:45:  Zariel Torgan: So do we want to try to get down there to that opening?
2:52:46:  Zariel Torgan: Is that something we want to try?
2:52:49: DM: Yeah. Leopold, did you, in your mind, can you take yourself apart?
2:52:52: DM: Are your limbs detachable to any extent?
2:52:57: DM: I, yeah, I, I think that, uh, that seems reasonable that you could detach an arm and reattach it.
2:52:59: Leopold Magnus: It's like basically, uh, there are other famous automatons in D and D who can replace limbs and stuff for other ones.
2:53:10: DM: I don't see why you couldn't. Yeah. Right. And I think getting down to the bottom in full form and artificers specifically can modify it or add like robotic arms.
2:53:13: Leopold Magnus: Yeah. Right. And I think getting down to the bottom in full form and artificers specifically can modify it or add like robotic arms.
2:53:16: Leopold Magnus: So yeah, all, um,
2:53:25: Leopold Magnus: I guess I will take both my arms off.
2:53:33: DM: You guys, as it stands now, I'll get down the tunnel if you'd like.
2:53:40: Kaladen Shash: Yeah.
2:53:42: Kaladen Shash: Just slide right into the water, slide. Feet first, jump right up into the wall.
2:53:47: DM: We'll get a little into this. We won't get too far.
2:53:55: DM: But as you guys, you shimmy slowly down one at a time.
2:54:01: DM: Two of you carry down Leopold's arms like strapped to your back so that he can sort of like just slowly scrape the soft dirt.
2:54:09: DM: So it doesn't make a loud noise, but down to the bottom.
2:54:18: DM: And when you get there, you are in a what is at first dark tunnel, but
2:54:24: DM: Like, it's pretty dark other than the firelight, and then you've got where the firelight ends, 10 more feet of darkness or so, and then you see, like, bioluminescence on the walls.
2:54:37: DM: A light blue sort of emanates off of certain plants, and there's like a little fog that sort of sits a couple inches off the ground that also has, like, a light quality to it of light blue.
2:54:51: DM: The whole thing is, like, ambiently lit.  very beautiful but you can tell where your firelight hits it doesn't reflect that would we know at this distance that we've traveled how far we are away from the edge of the dome underground uh you wouldn't
2:55:14: DM: but if you like did some like logical turnarounds in your head you this tunnel seems to lead back towards the center of the city gotcha not out directionally okay well then i uh say will what do you guys think yeah real sneaky like try to follow whatever trail we've seen here
2:55:51: Leopold Magnus: Leo pulls, attaching his arms and just making a lot of noise doing it. You can kind of hear them go... Everybody give me a stealth check with disadvantage.
2:56:16:  Zariel Torgan: That is a natural one for a total of three.
2:56:28: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, I rolled a 21 and then a 20.
2:56:38:  Zariel Torgan: That's actually decent for us. 20.
2:56:42:  Zariel Torgan: You have a natural one.
2:56:45: DM: Yeah, I know. A 14.
2:56:46: DM: Um, unfortunately, a nat one, uh, let's do group average. Actually, we'll do, we'll do that.
2:57:06: DM: Uh, not great.
2:57:09: DM: You don't know the effects of it, but you can tell collectively you're not being terribly bad.
2:57:16: DM: not as loud as you were self-conscious of initially and like Zariel's quick to like loudly shh to Leopold without thinking about how loud that was in turn but you guys sort of get your volume under control after that.
2:57:43:  Zariel Torgan: Do we hear anything?
2:57:48:  Zariel Torgan: Give me a perception check.
2:57:58: DM: You hear some scuttling.
2:58:00: DM: Nothing so loud and consistent that you can tangibly pinpoint it to something, but you hear movement distantly in the halls.
2:58:13: Kaladen Shash: Can we move towards that noise?
2:59:02:  Zariel Torgan: Can I see anything down with this or is my torch precluding my vision?
2:59:10: DM: Are you bringing the torch with you?
2:59:14:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah, I don't have dark vision, so I'd have to.
2:59:18: DM: Again, without the torch, there does seem to be the ambient light.
2:59:22:  Zariel Torgan: Oh, I forgot about that.
2:59:24: DM: But if you want the torch because it's like this gives me better lighting for my character, like keep the torch.
2:59:24: DM: I was just verifying for my own knowledge that you're taking.
2:59:41:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah, I'll hang on to it. OK.
2:59:45:  Zariel Torgan: Well, what do you guys think? Looks like this one might meet up with that one over there down below.
2:59:56: Kaladen Shash: Yes, let's, we can go straight ahead.
2:59:57: Kaladen Shash: We just need, can we tell, can I do another perception check from here?
3:00:00: Kaladen Shash: Does it sound like there's noise in one direction, straight or right?
3:00:09: DM: With the combined Zaryl asking if it can look right and you listening for right,
3:00:15: DM: instantly you see peeling itself off of the wall this tiny little it it pops up the wall bipedally and then it like crouches where like all four of its limbs it or it's like walking tools this little tiny creature shrills really loud at you it's got like a bulbous
3:00:42: DM: mushroom cap head that leads into like a mycelium body uh warped into like what used to be humanoid in shape like childish in size but it doesn't look human it's just basic anatomical layout humanoid but it's like a mushroom and like the trills on where its mouth would be just like vibrate back and forth enough that it like audibly like
3:01:11: DM: kisses at you and go ahead the three of you will roll initiative nice jesus you guys that's good good you know you can say that it will
3:01:44: DM: up first then, let's have Kaladin go. For my current position, kind of between them and the baddie right in front of me, I'm going to go ahead and just cast Firebolt, which will be a hit on DC.
3:02:01: Kaladen Shash: Not going to hit at an 8, that's just baloney.
3:02:09: Kaladen Shash: does misfire fires long hits the wall.
3:02:09: DM: And you see like the natural like with the better lighting on the wall, the whole wall seems to be coded in like a fungal network of like thread like little like appendages of different mushrooms and fungus and it's for a second but it's moist enough that it like extinguishes on its own.
3:02:22: DM: But yes, an eight does miss anything else you can do?
3:02:39: Kaladen Shash: No, I think I'm just going to move to the side over here.
3:02:43: Kaladen Shash: Just kind of like, well, if I stay against the wall back here, will I not come within melee of this thing?
3:02:52: DM: I believe I mapped out the movement to the players.
3:02:56: DM: You're like a full 10 feet away, so you can avoid its space.
3:03:00: Kaladen Shash: OK.
3:03:00: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, I'm just going to tuck in sort of on this end of the hall, so he's got to start shooting.
3:03:07: DM: All right, next up, Leopold.
3:03:10: Leopold Magnus: Okay, so when that fireball bounced around the room, were we able to kind of see anything down this tunnel? Any other creatures or?
3:03:20: DM: We'll reveal a little bit more. It does reveal a little bit for a second, but you don't see anything down there.
3:03:28: Leopold Magnus: So I'll imbue three stones with magic. They'll kind of rotate above my head, kind of swirling around my body. And I will launch one of the stones at this mycelium with incredible speed.
3:03:46: Leopold Magnus: Hold ahead.
3:03:50: Leopold Magnus: Oh, God. Natural one.
3:03:53: Leopold Magnus: That does miss.
3:03:55: Kaladen Shash: We're flying.
3:03:58: Leopold Magnus: And that is my action and bonus action.
3:04:14:  Zariel Torgan: All right, I'm going to rotate around the opposite side, hopefully to get flanking.
3:04:21:  Zariel Torgan: And then I'm going to use my thorn whip with advantage.
3:04:30:  Zariel Torgan: It's gonna be a 15 to hit. 15 hits.
3:04:32:  Zariel Torgan: That's gonna be 3 piercing damage from my Thorn Whip as I reach into the ground and I pull out a vine and just start whipping this thing with it.
3:04:47: DM: That 3 damage instantly looks very hurt.
3:05:16: DM: Gotcha, gotcha.
3:05:17: DM: On its turn, because the Myconid has taken damage, any other Myconids within 240 feet per distress force can sense its pain. You don't know the repercussions of that, but that's just sort of the flavor of the screen.
3:05:33: DM: It will, because the only person that's actually done damage, turn around and take a swipe at Zariel.
3:05:40: DM: I pre-rolled all the damage for my monster, so I'm just gonna do the roll to hit.
3:06:02: DM: Does a Stefan hit?
3:06:05: DM: It does not.
3:06:07: DM: It tries to punch you.
3:06:08: DM: You see it's got
3:06:11: DM: Dubby like end of limbs where like it doesn't really have fingers or paws. It's just like ends in like Dock of the mushroom, which is why you guys didn't see tracks But it just tries to beat the shit out of you and it misses back up to the top we've got Kaladin Yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and sort of do the same thing again.
3:06:29: Kaladen Shash: I'm gonna Point my quarterstaff spear towards it and another firebolt
3:06:40: Kaladen Shash: There we go, 22 to hit.
3:06:42: Kaladen Shash: Nice. Hit.
3:06:47: Kaladen Shash: Oh, what a lame damage.
3:06:50: Kaladen Shash: Two fire damage.
3:06:55: DM: Two fire damage. It looks like you took out half of its remaining life force.
3:07:06: Kaladen Shash: Once you get something else, let's play it bold.
3:07:11: Kaladen Shash: No, that's it, you already pulled him.
3:07:13: Leopold Magnus: Kill it.
3:07:20: Leopold Magnus: So I'm gonna launch one of my last magic stones using a bonus action.
3:07:27: Leopold Magnus: Okay.
3:07:27: Leopold Magnus: Roll to hit. And roll to hit. Come on.
3:07:33: Leopold Magnus: Nice. Looks like that, it hit. 18 hit. So I'm gonna fling one of those stones
3:07:41: Leopold Magnus: Oh, max damage.
3:07:46: DM: The stone hits into like its little cap of its head and just ignites and it lets out this high-pitched squeal as it like shrivels up and like burns to a crisp and then just like twitches and then stops moving.
3:08:04: DM: and the little mushroom creature has been killed.
3:08:09: Leopold Magnus: Oh no, dear God, I think I accidentally killed the thing.
3:08:12: DM: Give me a perception check.
3:08:20: Kaladen Shash: Yeah.
3:08:27:  Zariel Torgan: Dirty 20. That's not bad, 18.
3:08:36: DM: 30, 20, 18 are great. You do hear noise from the tunnel that you came from, the tunnel down here, and the tunnel to the left, your left.
3:08:46: DM: Of course.
3:08:50: Leopold Magnus: Like inside the tunnel or up like above it?
3:08:52: DM: You hear like soft, what steps like
3:08:57: DM: if you if a creature were made of memory foam and it was sprinting like you can hear the impacts but it's like dull thuds as it's absorbed into its steps uh you just hear a lot of like commotion in various tunnels uh you notice the creature didn't make loud noises it doesn't seem to have vocal cords so you're not hearing like screaming from down the halls okay it's not working
3:09:27: Leopold Magnus: So I basically dispatch this creature with my bonus action. Would I still have an action?
3:09:34: Leopold Magnus: Yes, you're still in initiative.
3:09:36: Leopold Magnus: Okay, so standing right here between these two tunnels, as my action I will cast Grease. And I'd like, is it possible to kind of spray five, because it says ten feet in area, five feet in one tunnel and five feet in another? Just kind of split it? Sure.
3:09:54: Leopold Magnus: And that would sufficiently block that tunnel off so that there's grease covering the ground on both tunnels, correct?
3:09:59: DM: Yes, both tunnels are difficult terrain.
3:10:04: Leopold Magnus: Yep.
3:10:09: Leopold Magnus: This one and this one here. So that eliminates two of the three angles of attack, or at least it'll slow them down.
3:10:15: Leopold Magnus: And then after kind of being in shock from dispatching this poor mycelium, and I was really beat up by that, I'm going to kind of step back and I'll say to the team,
3:10:34: Leopold Magnus: I don't think what's coming is really going to be that friendly. We better get ready. And I'll start spraying grease from both of my arms. Yeah, just kind of Inspector Gadget, little pipe pops out and just start spraying down both tunnels.
3:10:51: Leopold Magnus: And I'll say, group up, men.
3:10:57:  Zariel Torgan: I'll turn off the, he does that when he's scared.
3:11:02: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, I was gonna say, I'm not sure if that's... All right, I'll ready my action, I guess, to write a thorn whip.
3:11:21: DM: Next up, something happens.
3:11:27: DM: Do any of you have darkvision?
3:11:29: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, I have 60 feet darkvision.
3:11:33: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, I should be able to see a good chunk of this hallway.
3:11:39: DM: You actually don't see anything yet.
3:11:45: Kaladen Shash: Okay.
3:12:01:  Zariel Torgan: Uh, I might preemptively do my second Wild Shape.
3:12:10:  Zariel Torgan: Transfer into my Dire Wolf form.
3:12:16:  Zariel Torgan: Okay. Just being ready.
3:12:18: DM: Everybody give me a Perception check in the close quarters as he shifts.
3:12:30:  Zariel Torgan: 30-20.
3:12:35:  Zariel Torgan: Oh.
3:12:37:  Zariel Torgan: 16.
3:12:40:  Zariel Torgan: Oh, gotcha.
3:12:43: DM: Uh, nothing.
3:12:46: DM: Uh, you turn into your direwolf.
3:12:48: DM: Is that a bonus action or action?
3:12:53:  Zariel Torgan: Uh, it's a bonus action. My action, I'm just holding an attack for something that I see. Okay.
3:12:57: DM: Do you want to move at all or are you going to stay there?
3:13:01: DM: I like my spot.
3:13:01:  Zariel Torgan: I think they're all converging on us.
3:13:06: DM: Next up, something happens.
3:13:10: DM: Back up to the top, Kaladin, your turn.
3:13:13: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, can I see... Can I cast a Fireball down this hallway?
3:13:24: Kaladen Shash: The one I'm looking down over here.
3:13:27: DM: Yeah, you cast one.
3:13:30: DM: for some reasons. There we go.
3:13:32: DM: Lights up like this much more.
3:13:44: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, I think that'd be it.
3:13:48: Kaladen Shash: The alert.
3:13:50: Kaladen Shash: Something out there.
3:13:57: DM: Leopold.
3:13:58: DM: Still nothing visually, but that's because I didn't realize these fuckers had such slow movement.
3:14:08: Leopold Magnus: Um, I'm just gonna cast magic stone again, so that way I can refresh the three.
3:14:19: Leopold Magnus: And, um, I guess I don't know why that did that.
3:14:24: Leopold Magnus: Um,  And I'll hold a, can I hold a bonus action or can you only hold an action?
3:14:33: DM: Okay.
3:14:37: Leopold Magnus: Yeah. I already did. I already did an action. So, um, I just have a bonus action with my bonus action.
3:14:38: DM: Yeah.
3:14:44: Leopold Magnus: I will ready a torch.
3:14:55: Leopold Magnus: and light that up and hold it next to my face.
3:15:02: Leopold Magnus: And that's my turn.
3:15:05: DM: Alrighty, next up, running out of the darkness, another like quadrupedal fungus monster sprinting out with its 10 feet of movement, 20 foot dash, it gets to right where it is right there.
3:15:25: DM: Next up, turning this corner behind you guys, you hear much more lumbering.
3:15:33: DM: You see a like five and a half foot tall Mike and it's sort of like warrior.
3:15:37: DM: It's it still has remnants of clothing on it.
3:15:43: DM: Its face is like just an ugly mesh spider webbing of like my ceiling where like eyehole indentations are that big go into a big flare at the top.
3:16:01: DM: I'll pull a Jesse.
3:16:05: DM: One of these. Nice.
3:16:11: DM: It comes lumbering down the hall, and that's about as far as it gets with its full movement.
3:16:18: DM: Next up, also barely making it out of the darkness and into your dark vision, you see another little guy
3:16:27: DM: Sort of just flopping on the floor as it comes running in.
3:16:33:  Zariel Torgan: So I held my action on the last one. Yes.
3:16:36: DM: Yes.
3:16:37:  Zariel Torgan: Could I have hit this guy when he came out? I've got a 30-foot reach on my thorn whip.
3:16:43:  Zariel Torgan: Who is this guy?
3:16:45:  Zariel Torgan: Uh, the first guy that appeared, the red one on the right.
3:16:53:  Zariel Torgan: Uh, sorry, the yellow one on the right, this one.
3:16:57:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah.
3:16:58: DM: Same one.
3:16:59: DM: Uh, yeah, you can.
3:17:00:  Zariel Torgan: Perfect.
3:17:09: DM: Nice.
3:17:18: Kaladen Shash: One damage. Do you get to hold?
3:17:28:  Zariel Torgan: Yes, 10 feet closer to me.
3:17:39: DM: Perfect. Anything else? Again, they look like this.
3:17:49: DM: But also, all three of them of the different types are in this photo. So this tall one right here is the one that's on your left.
3:17:57: DM: The one on the very forefront bottom that's on all fours, that's the little ones.
3:18:05: DM: Almost like dog-like.
3:18:13:  Zariel Torgan: Um, so that was just my held action for my last turn. Is it my actual turn now?
3:18:19:  Zariel Torgan: Nope. Okay. How much of this is difficult terrain?
3:18:23: DM: Uh, they haven't hit it yet, but I think it was a 5 foot square down each hallway.
3:18:29: Leopold Magnus: Yep, because I split it 50-50. Alright, I'll do another, uh, I'll do another Thorn Whip.
3:18:36:  Zariel Torgan: Natural 20.
3:18:38:  Zariel Torgan: But it's not your turn yet.
3:18:40:  Zariel Torgan: Oh! Sorry, I thought I went after- Well, save that nat 20.
3:18:45: DM: No, there's this one over here.
3:18:49: DM: That just makes it into Kaladin's view.
3:18:58: DM: Now it's your turn. Natural 20. You're doing it on the little guy?
3:19:02: DM: Yeah. Okay.
3:19:03: DM: Go ahead and roll that damage.
3:19:11: DM: Uh, so 14?
3:19:14:  Zariel Torgan: Um... No.
3:19:16:  Zariel Torgan: Oh, did it roll it for damage?
3:19:18:  Zariel Torgan: Yeah, it recognized it as a crit.
3:19:21: DM: Yeah, okay. So, seven damage... Uh, it's still more than enough.
3:19:25: DM: How do you want to finish this?
3:19:29:  Zariel Torgan: I want to grab a root in the ground and yank on it and then do like one of those chain things where you try to whip the chain and have it go through the ground and then pop up out next to this creature and then slice it in half.
3:19:46: DM: uh the roots sort of like whip up through the ground like you're pulling up a long like barb like blackberry root that's very and it whips up and just cuts from like the bottom through the top of its head in that order and then it just like splits in part and you can see the whole like network of its body nice after you this guy moves up 20 feet
3:20:24: DM: Just now entering it, but he ran out of movement before it did anything to him.
3:20:30: DM: He truly only has 20 feet. I'm going to take aim at the guy down the hallway that I'm looking into.
3:20:34: Kaladen Shash: And I'm going to cast Chromatic Orb.
3:20:52: Kaladen Shash: 24 to hit.
3:21:18: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, I think I'll just hold my ground.
3:21:22: DM: Okay.
3:21:24: DM: Leopold, you are up. You've got a big guy behind you, a little guy in front of you, and then it seems like Kaladin is fighting one more in the distance.
3:21:34: Leopold Magnus: Um, yeah, so I'll, uh, once I see Zaryl take one of the little guys down, I say, Zaryl, excellent job!
3:21:42: Leopold Magnus: I'll focus on the big one down here.
3:21:44: Leopold Magnus: And I will use my action to try to make an attack with my crossbow, my hand crossbow.
3:22:02: DM: 11. 11 does not hit.
3:22:06: DM: Rather, it does hit it. The bolt shoots out and into its body, but it just doesn't seem to hit, like,
3:22:14: DM: uh a vital spot it just sort of like goes into like the fungal material the meat of the fungus and it just doesn't seem to affect it too much got it and then uh with my bonus action i will use magic stone awesome good action economy for fuck's sake it was a 16 and rolled to a three oh no that's not hit
3:22:47: DM: this tall fungus infuriated with its arm motions but again not really making a whole lot of sound hits your difficult terrain and then can only make it about half the way more distance to you before it runs up any amount of movement next up this one over here can it even do anything to you
3:23:25: DM: It can't get close enough to do anything important, so it's just gonna do its full movement.
3:23:32: DM: Zario, your turn.
3:23:36:  Zariel Torgan: Alright.
3:23:38:  Zariel Torgan: Let's see.
3:23:40:  Zariel Torgan: I'm gonna... How far away is that one?
3:23:43:  Zariel Torgan: Is that 10 feet?
3:23:50: DM: You gotta be more specific.
3:23:53:  Zariel Torgan: Just the one right in front of me.
3:23:56: DM: Uh, ten feet, yeah.
3:23:59: DM: Just outside of, uh, Greece.
3:24:03:  Zariel Torgan: And if I wanted to be able to physically attack it, I'd have to get in Greece? If you wanted to get in Greece, yeah. Okay. Alright, I'll stay away from the Greece. I'll do, uh... ...another Thorn Whip.
3:24:16:  Zariel Torgan: Do it, do it, do it.
3:24:18:  Zariel Torgan: That is not gonna hit. But it's a seven.
3:24:27:  Zariel Torgan: Alright, I'm gonna use my movement to just back up between these two guys here.
3:24:33:  Zariel Torgan: And then that's my turn.
3:24:36: DM: Okay.
3:24:37: DM: Next up is... this little guy right here.
3:24:42: DM: He's got 20 feet of a dash, so he's gonna use 5 feet, hit into it. So he's got 15 feet left, which turns to 7.
3:24:51: DM: So he can only make it to...  Leopold with a dash. They can't attack.
3:24:58: DM: Next up, Kaladin.
3:25:01: Leopold Magnus: I'm going to take... Go ahead.
3:25:04: Leopold Magnus: I'm just curious if that would kill a cross into the difficult terrain, would it have to make a deck save?
3:25:10: Leopold Magnus: It doesn't.
3:25:12: Leopold Magnus: I think if it...
3:25:16: Leopold Magnus: says, uh, each creature standing in its area must succeed at dex saving throw or fall prone. Creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed at dex saving throw or fall prone.
3:25:32: DM: Uh, the big guy on... Did he make it into the thing?
3:25:42: DM: My computer keeps losing connection, so things aren't totally syncing up.
3:25:49: DM: I don't think the Sovereign has made it all the way into the grease, right?
3:25:54: DM: You still back here?
3:25:55: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, because it was five feet, so.
3:26:01: DM: This little guy, though, let's make it. You said what kind of deck's name? 14. False prone.
3:26:25: DM: But it is still back to Kaladin though.
3:26:30: Kaladen Shash: I'm going to go ahead and just take aim again. I'm going to cast another chromatic orb at the baddie down the hallway from me.
3:26:38: Kaladen Shash: 16 to hit.
3:26:43: Kaladen Shash: 16 hits.
3:26:50: Kaladen Shash: Okay, well another 11 fire damage.
3:26:54: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, finish him.
3:27:00: Kaladen Shash: We took him down. Yeah, dead.
3:27:06: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, and then I'm gonna use.
3:27:09: Kaladen Shash: I'm gonna use a little bit of movement to.
3:27:18: Kaladen Shash: I'm gonna stay on my ground, it doesn't seem like that guy moves. Okay.
3:27:27: DM: Staying where you are, Leopold.
3:27:30: DM: You're sort of almost up in face-to-face with this, like, very large mushroom creature.
3:27:32: DM: Hasn't quite made it to you yet. You've got a little, like, dog-like mushroom that just tripped at your feet.
3:27:43: DM: Uh, and those seem to be the only two left.
3:27:48: Leopold Magnus: Yep, so I'll back up a little bit from the front line here. And retreat behind Kaladin and Zyrael and I'll say, boy those things are getting a little too close for comfort to be honest.
3:28:09: Leopold Magnus: And I will again attack the big guy with my hand crossbow.
3:28:19: Leopold Magnus: But I guess one point of clarification. So I've got these infusions that I can use. Maybe I'm not at the prerequisite level, but one of them is a repeating shot that a simple or martial weapon with ammunition property
3:28:40: Leopold Magnus: A magic weapon grants a plus one bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
3:28:46: Leopold Magnus: Is that something I can just choose to do? Like, how do I do that for a weapon? Is it something I have to prepare?
3:28:52: DM: Your infusions work a very specific way. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch up to two objects, imbuing them with one of your artificer infusions.
3:29:03: DM: It infinitely attunes you to it if you want to, but you have to have established what you wanted.
3:29:10: DM: before going into it.
3:29:12: Leopold Magnus: Okay. Right. Well, and we've just gotten our, our outfit. Um, we haven't taken a long distance then. So, um, yeah, so I'll just, uh, roll the, roll the hit with my crossbow.
3:29:24: Leopold Magnus: Yep.
3:29:25: Leopold Magnus: Oh, it's typically with repeating shot doesn't have a level requirement.
3:29:28: DM: So if you wanted to do that, when you had a chance, you could do it at this level.
3:29:34: Leopold Magnus: How do I do that within the, um, the tool D and D beyond?
3:29:40: DM: That's a great question. I've never played an Artificer, so I don't know, but I can figure it out if you want me to.
3:29:46: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, we'll figure it out later. Or I can play around with it too.
3:29:49: Leopold Magnus: But at 18 to hit the big guy? 18 hits.
3:29:56: Leopold Magnus: Or with my hand crossbow.
3:30:00: Leopold Magnus: It just shoots out of my arm and I kind of point it directly at the large mushroom and I say,
3:30:09: Leopold Magnus: Well, you better take one of these. And I launch it off, kind of recoiling a little bit as it fires.
3:30:19: DM: Nice. This one seems to hold more purchase.
3:30:23: DM: The crossbow sinks into a thick part of the mushroom stick, and you see the shoulder jolts back. It didn't just pass through without hitting nothing.
3:30:36: Leopold Magnus: Okay, and then with my bonus action, I will launch one of my two remaining magic stones.
3:30:46: Leopold Magnus: All right, roll to hit.
3:30:49: Leopold Magnus: 13 to hit.
3:30:52: Leopold Magnus: 13 just hits.
3:30:55: Leopold Magnus: Okay.
3:30:57: Leopold Magnus: Meets it, beats it. So I will launch a magic stone off and attempt to smack it between the eyes.
3:31:15: DM: Okay.
3:31:17: DM: Hurts it, doesn't kill it. Anything else you want to do?
3:31:21: Leopold Magnus: Nope, that's it for me.
3:31:26: DM: It is now the big guy's turn. Being that they are all in a shared network, being like fungus obviously, it knows that the other one took a spill on this stuff.
3:31:37: DM: I rolled for it.
3:31:39: DM: Oh, it only got a 10. Maybe it doesn't, no.
3:31:42: DM: We'll do a pure luck check on the table to see if it jumps over or if it trips in this stuff.
3:31:53: DM: A 12, it's gonna attempt to jump it.
3:31:56: DM: It's got 30 feet of movement, which is more than enough.
3:32:01: DM: It is gonna land directly in front of you, Zario.
3:32:05: DM: Not in you.
3:32:10: DM: And I'll make it do a deck save as it lands at the tail end of the grease. Uh, 18 on the die, does it pretty handedly. It is going to...
3:32:25: DM: It can do hallucination spores. It can eject spores that one creature can see in front of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 con save.
3:32:36: DM: So Zara, go ahead and give me a con save.
3:32:47: DM: 15, you're good. It is gonna roll to hit you then. It just, once it sees that that fails, it just like goes to punch you directly in the face with its big-ass club hands.
3:32:57:  Zariel Torgan: Alright, my AC is 14 with wolf stats.
3:33:02: DM: It did 18. 15 plus 3. Ooh, ouch.
3:33:06: DM: And like I said, I pre-rolled the damage. You take 10 points of bludgeoning damage.
3:33:12: DM: And you take seven points of poison damage.
3:33:19: DM: Heavy hit.
3:33:22: DM: Next up, it is your turn, Zariel.
3:33:26:  Zariel Torgan: Alright. Is there room enough for me to be able to skirt around him so that I can be flanking with Kaladin?
3:33:36: DM: No, not this guy. Plus, you'd have to go into the grease.
3:34:14: DM: I'll just stay where I am.
3:34:16: DM: This little tiny guy right here gets up. If he starts his turn in the grease, he has to make another save, correct?
3:34:25: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, exactly. If he enters it, starts his turn, ends his turn, et cetera. 15.
3:34:32: Leopold Magnus: That saves the save was 14. OK.
3:34:39: DM: He can't get flanking either because there's a wolf who's too big, so he's just going to make an attack at you.
3:35:01: DM: Yeah.
3:35:06: Kaladen Shash: Um, both these individuals are getting pretty close to me.
3:35:14: DM: Yeah. Everybody's sort of punching it on you.
3:35:17: Kaladen Shash: I'm going to pass burning hands, which will be a deck save and I'll sculpt it to avoid Zario.
3:35:28: DM: Alrighty.
3:35:29: DM: You can hit both of them. Go ahead and roll to hit. Or is it a deck safe or burning hands?
3:35:30: Kaladen Shash: You can hit both of them.
3:35:33: Kaladen Shash: The deck save. So it'll be taking damage.
3:35:36: Kaladen Shash: You're getting half faith damage. It's eight fire damage.
3:35:44: Leopold Magnus: That one down there taking everything extra for being covered in grease.
3:35:49: DM: You tell me you've got the spell up. Does it say anything about increased fire damage at all?
3:35:56: DM: They both roll a 10.
3:35:59: Kaladen Shash: They both fail. OK.
3:36:05: Leopold Magnus: It says nothing about getting set on fire.
3:36:09: DM: OK.
3:36:11: DM: So they take eight damage.
3:36:15: DM: Uh, the little guy right here, fully burnt to a crisp.
3:36:23: DM: Uh, and then this guy doesn't seem to like it, but he's not going down yet.
3:36:32: Kaladen Shash: Yeah. The rest of my turn. Cause I'm still outside of his melee range. There's enough of a bubble between us.
3:36:40: Kaladen Shash: It's now. Okay. I'm going to go ahead and back up.
3:36:44: DM: Okay.
3:36:47: DM: You say you've got Direwolf, Zariel sort of buffering between the two of you.
3:36:51: DM: Yeah.
3:37:00: Kaladen Shash: That's it, that's my turn.
3:37:06: Leopold Magnus: Okay, um... I will target the sole remaining enemy.
3:37:13: Leopold Magnus: And I will...
3:37:29: Leopold Magnus: I will walk up to this creature and I'll say, Zarya, look out!
3:37:36: Leopold Magnus: And I'll kind of try to steamroll this big guy and push him backwards. I'm going to shove him.
3:37:53: Leopold Magnus: Oh, for fuck's sake.
3:37:56: Kaladen Shash: Ow. We're on fire with these rolls.
3:38:02: DM: He didn't do great, but he got better than you with the sticks. You go to shove up, and it's a thick, thick stack of just mushroom mats.
3:38:12: DM: Doesn't go very far.
3:38:15: DM: You have a bonus action if you still need to use one.
3:38:19: Leopold Magnus: Yep, and then with my last magic stone. I'll use a bonus action You kind of fling one of the stones up towards him as I step back just a few One roll to hit 16 16 16 hit 60 inch with this stuff Nice nice looking very hurt
3:38:49: DM: Next up is this guy, however.
3:38:52: DM: You are, I'm gonna say you're the most immediate threat.
3:38:57: DM: So go ahead and, I think he's got more than me.
3:39:01: DM: Give me a constitution saving throw.
3:39:09: DM: Yes, you. 15.
3:39:16: DM: 15, you're fine. Seeing again that this doesn't work, he's gonna just try to punch you in the face.
3:39:22: DM: Moving into your son, that one.
3:39:26: DM: Pushing up into both you, uh, misses.
3:39:36: DM: Direwolf, Zariel, you are up.
3:39:39:  Zariel Torgan: Alright, I just read on this that I get pack tactics. If, uh,
3:39:46:  Zariel Torgan: I'm gonna roll this one now. Advantage, 21 to hit.
3:39:58:  Zariel Torgan: And that's gonna be... 6 piercing damage.
3:40:01:  Zariel Torgan: Guys... Every bit of damage helps.
3:40:08: DM: Just looking more and more hurt.
3:40:15: DM: Excellent, I'm going to cast Firebolt.
3:40:17: Kaladen Shash: I'm going to lean my quarterstaff spear forward and the side that's got the blunt fist on one end is where the Firebolt will emanate from.
3:40:28: Kaladen Shash: It'll be a 16 to hit.
3:40:31: Kaladen Shash: Nice, it crawls out of the fingers and then shoots.
3:40:32: DM: 16 hits.
3:40:38: Kaladen Shash: Not much of a hit.
3:40:40: Kaladen Shash: 2 fire damage.
3:40:51: Leopold Magnus: Quite the round.
3:40:57: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, so with the remaining effort that I have, I am going to... I guess I get disadvantage for shooting a ranged weapon so close, right, with my crossbow?
3:41:13: Leopold Magnus: That's correct.  I will cast again, Magic Stone as my action.
3:41:20: Leopold Magnus: And then having refreshed the three stones around me, I'll launch another at this creature.
3:41:32: Leopold Magnus: Go ahead.
3:41:41: DM: 9 damage. Hey, finally some more damage.
3:41:44: DM: Uh, getting close to Death's door. It's walking up those steps. It's getting ready to knock.
3:41:53: DM: Anything else you're gonna do on your turn?
3:41:56: Leopold Magnus: Um... No, that's... that's it.
3:42:01: DM: Okay, next up is this Myconid Sovereign as it's called. It is going to try to do the spores on... We'll just do Zariel again. We're going to keep back and forth and alternate it. Give me a DC 12 con save.
3:42:23: DM: Oh, it had used its pacifying spores.
3:42:28: DM: It ejects spores that one creature can see within 5 feet, yada yada DC 12, or be stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turn, ending the condition on itself on a success.
3:42:43: DM: So you are stunned. It is now going to punch you with advantage.
3:42:49: DM: Oof.
3:43:01: DM: Yeah.
3:43:03: DM: You take 18 points of bludgeoning damage and 18 points of poison damage.
3:43:13: DM: Wow.
3:43:16: DM: Well, that's crit, so that doubled both of the d- sets of d4s that I had rolled. It was 9 and 9 before the crit.
3:43:24: Kaladen Shash: Yeah.
3:43:25: Kaladen Shash: the one shot he got off he got off yeah uh direwolf i believe goes down and then you go back into your normal health correct yeah i'm down to 12 regular health you see this monster
3:43:40: DM: punches the wolf in the head so hard that the wolf like flattens onto the ground and the form disperses and laying not mechanically face down but down on the ground again is Zariel taking a huge hit.
3:43:59: DM: Zariel it is your turn though.
3:44:02: DM: You are stunned. Go ahead at the end of your turn make a con save.
3:44:02: Leopold Magnus: You are stunned.
3:44:04: DM: I'm gonna say does that not affect only the Direwolf?
3:44:11: DM: No, it affects his person.
3:44:22: Kaladen Shash: Uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna launch another Firebolt through the fist end of the quarterstaff.
3:44:29: Kaladen Shash: Oh, I don't know if that's gonna hit. Thirteen to hit.
3:44:34: Kaladen Shash: Thirteen, me to beat it.
3:44:38: Kaladen Shash: Uh, and then damage is right here.  little better five okay okay hurt hurt hurt hurt but not dead leopold swinging for the kill come on uh... yes so with the uh... with the kill i'm gonna go in and uh... i'm going to
3:45:08: Leopold Magnus: Do a unarmed strike. I'm gonna swing at him with great speed and effort to make connection Fuck's sake Does your third one how many is that worth one?
3:45:22: Kaladen Shash: Oh my god for the night.
3:45:30: Kaladen Shash: Wow, just get him out of the campaign early. That's all right. That's all right.
3:45:33: DM: Can't hit anything.
3:45:35: DM: Change your online dice.
3:45:37: DM: Basic black is not working for you. So that didn't hit.
3:45:40: Leopold Magnus: Unless you're going to move.
3:45:41: DM: Unless you're going to move.
3:45:45: Leopold Magnus: Yes, you do.
3:45:47: Leopold Magnus: So I'll use my second magic stone and unleash it.
3:45:56: Leopold Magnus: Get him. 14, I think, does hit. Come on, 14 hit.
3:45:57: DM: Come on, 14 hit.
3:46:02: DM: Come on.
3:46:04: DM: Five damage.
3:46:07: DM: Hurt, but not dead.
3:46:09: DM: Oh my God.
3:46:10: DM: You see the magic stone embeds in its right shoulder and the arm explodes off. It's got one arm. It's limping on the other leg. It seems weary, but it's still holding onto the fight determined to keep you guys out from getting any further on its turn.
3:46:28: DM: After you deliver that near fatal blow, it's gonna hit you with some stunning spores. Give me a con saving throw. 15 passes, it's gonna hit you regardless.
3:46:55: DM: Seven to hit it misses.
3:47:00: DM: Sariel, your turn again. You are stunned, but go ahead at the end of your turn and make a save.
3:47:06: DM: 22, you're up.
3:47:08: DM: Nice.
3:47:10: DM: Kaladin, your turn to finish it off.
3:47:11: DM: Come on, man.
3:47:18: Kaladen Shash: And four more fire damage.
3:47:23: DM: Finish the Mykonid Sombra.
3:47:29: Kaladen Shash: Same thing, I think I had a little quarter-staffed quarrel. And right as I sort of hit the hero pose, the fireball emanated from the staff.
3:47:40: DM: Take your stance, brace your legs, your robe flutters a little bit, shoots out and hits into it.
3:47:47: DM: It burns from the inside, not totally disintegrating, but the core of it, up through its head, seems to burn away and incinerate, leaving a hollow tube. It is dead.
3:48:06: Leopold Magnus: I think everyone okay.
3:48:11: Leopold Magnus: Kind of like stand up, dust myself off. Oh dear, dear.
3:48:14: Leopold Magnus: This was, this was not on my list of to do's today.
3:48:17: Leopold Magnus: That's great.
3:48:25: Kaladen Shash: Thanks for, thanks for letting us get into a little something.
3:48:34: Kaladen Shash: Oh yeah, I'm just happy you let us play that first little round of the tunnel fight.
3:48:39: DM: That was a tough roll all around, guys. I can't control that. That's just unfortunate.
3:48:46: Leopold Magnus: I was on a roll for natural ones.
3:48:50: DM: Yeah, I think I got it right. Let me confirm it before we get off. I was going to say, I skimmed through. I saw at least one or two.
3:48:50: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, I think I got it right.
3:48:53: Leopold Magnus: I was going to say, I skimmed through.
3:48:59: DM: Zariel nat 20 nat 1. I had a nat 1 and a nat 20.
3:49:04: DM: I don't know that Kaladin got any nat 1s or nat 20s. I was aiming right in the middle, no nats, no crits, no fails.
3:49:12: DM: Leopold got a kill, Zariel got a kill, or two kills, and then Kaladin got three kills.
3:49:18: DM: Nice.
3:49:19: Kaladen Shash: Got a couple of big hits early. Yeah.
3:49:23: Leopold Magnus: Yeah, that Chromatic Warp did a lot of damage.
3:49:27: Kaladen Shash: First one did, that one hit really well. It was an eight, a seven. If it could have even been like a five or another seven, it would have been a real home run.
3:49:35: DM: How was that spell economy for your team?
3:49:40: Kaladen Shash: How was the what? Spell economy.
3:49:42: DM: What do you guys got left?
3:49:44: Kaladen Shash: Oh, I'm spent. I've burned all three spell slots. I only had two. I did two chromatic orbs, did two chromatic orbs, and then did burning hands.
3:49:47: DM: I only had two.
3:49:56: Kaladen Shash: So, but I've got the cantrips at will, ready to play. And then short rest, I'm hoping we can do a short rest. I'll recover one spell slot while we're in here.
3:50:12: DM: We will see if you finish it and we pick up next week then, since we're not doing in-person until the week after.
3:50:17: DM: We don't have to like skip a day.
3:50:24: Kaladen Shash: Yeah, next week.
3:50:26: Kaladen Shash: That's right Are Jonathan Rex are you guys around I

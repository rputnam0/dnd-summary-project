Cletus Cobbington 00:00:00 Now I'm on... Okay, I went perfect. That was fake lag. Sorry. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:00 Well, if Leopold ever starts cutting in and out, then you can just attribute it to his voice transmitter.
Cyrus Schwert 00:00:01 Bueno, bueno. Craig deserved to interrupt you. That was awesome.
Dungeon Master 00:00:03 Sorry to interrupt you. Great thoughts. That was pretty good. It's true.
Kaladen Shash 00:00:06 Yeah. It's great.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:29 little faulty i'll have to tune it up later yep oh you recommended that one and i didn't watch it but i gotta write it down because i that sounded pretty badass
Cletus Cobbington 00:00:30 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:00:33 Rex, real quick before we actually get started. Have you seen the anime solo leveling? Well, the thing is, I don't know, Trace, if you've seen it. I don't think anybody else here would have. But...
Cletus Cobbington 00:00:57 First 10 episodes are boring, but then the last two are fucking good. The first season, please. That's my opinion. I haven't watched it yet.
Cyrus Schwert 00:00:58 No.
Dungeon Master 00:01:02 season 2 is fire so far the main character is like very strong but that's like separate but his character now is basically Leopold he stores the souls of things he's beaten and he puts it into his army so if you watch it there's going to be like I think a lot of really good influence because like I said I'm really loving it right now
Leopold Magnus 00:01:22 That's fucking badass. That's sick. Yeah, that's badass. That's cool. I mean, that's a dope idea. That's why I was like, I'm going to have fun with that. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:01:40 He's like a rogue necromancer. No.
Dungeon Master 00:01:45 Except that he started off this whole thing over-leveling strength. So anytime his other stuff sort of fails, he just kind of beats the shit out of whatever he's fighting. No, it's just in the anime. It is high fantasy. It's about these people who go into these gates that open up and beat them, essentially. It's just on Crunchyroll. I think season one might be on that. I don't know.
Kaladen Shash 00:01:54 Is it on anything? Is it just crunchy rolled at its own? That's what I thought. Okay. They've been hearing good things about it.
Cyrus Schwert 00:01:54 It's a D&D show? Got it.
Dungeon Master 00:02:15 Anyway, the main character ends up doing a secret challenge, and then he unlocks the player status. And so while everybody else is basically an NPC, he gets to level up. And so he's bypassing everybody that he's around. But nobody knows it because they can't process it.
Leopold Magnus 00:02:16 That's what I'm going to ask.
Cletus Cobbington 00:02:31 He was the absolute bottom-ranked crawler that he could be. And now he's basically like a god. Or at least able to develop a god. It's like that, except he's the only one.
Leopold Magnus 00:02:45 I really like that concept with, um, uh, what was that one where they were like in a video game, a sword art online. Yeah. I really liked that concept. And I was like, that's fucking badass. That sounds really cool. Hmm. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:02:46 Very good. So that's what, like, it... Yeah. Oh, no. You haven't watched season two, Trace, but I think his dad is there, and I think he's cut the same thing. Well, it's your fucking fault. Now you got something to look forward to.
Cyrus Schwert 00:02:50 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:02:52 Sword Art Online? Yeah, that was a great one.
Cletus Cobbington 00:03:07 Okay, spoiler, what the fuck? Well, I just basically watched it, so...
Leopold Magnus 00:03:15 It's cool. I wrote it down so I'll remember to watch it.
Dungeon Master 00:03:16 Anyway, welcome to session 29, everybody. Sort of zoning in before anybody can say anything else. Last session, you guys delved a little bit deeper into the Chiari Run Forest. You navigated through sort of the really dense and nearly suffocating web-choked paths under a recommendation from Leopold on your bay connection, and you sort of found like a visual magical tether
Kaladen Shash 00:03:34 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:03:46 guiding you through the forest as it sort of hung in the air. You did unfortunately walk into the result of your encounter check from the previous session and you found that you had walked into a giant spider web nest trap. And as the spiders delved and lunged at you and started sort of this gauntlet trial, Leopold
Kaladen Shash 00:04:06 All right.
Dungeon Master 00:04:14 unleashed a torrent of fire and you incinerated um every nearby threatening spider before you guys started running again um you began getting chased by this large arachnid that resembled more of a rock when it was unmoving its carapace is very um textured and jagged and it's got the shape of a stone um you had wolf spiders and eventually phase spider sort of
Dungeon Master 00:04:40 going in and out as they all chased you and you guys kept sprinting and killing and challenging and teleporting and as you made our way through you exploded over the water way below it was
Dungeon Master 00:04:56 Cyrus who's the first one to get through followed by everybody else and you guys as you fell into the sort of mouth of the river at the bottom you had a chance to sort of take in the beauty and horror that is Moonhaven as you were just free falling the wind sort of whipping by your ears but you saw the large cracked dome that sort of hung just like some sort of
Cyrus Schwert 00:05:03 Let's go.
Cletus Cobbington 00:05:11 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:05:24 disenchanted arcane glass covering the top, a huge gap in it where vines have crawled up and crawled into it. An unnatural stream of water sort of pulled into the city, submerging almost all of the city save a small portion on the back end. You rested at the base of the dome after you landed in the water and sort of made your way through the forest in just a couple hours.
Dungeon Master 00:05:53 You constructed a feeding mechanism to feed Zariel's wolf pups because you realized that you couldn't let them have air every once in a while if you were going to be underwater. So with the help of Cletus, you crafted a stone kennel and feeder with the intention of coming back before they sort of ran out of space and food or feces and stuff. It's not permanent, right?
Dungeon Master 00:06:22 and we ended it with after you guys had rested you all woke up Kaladin was given the roasted almond Cyrus is a giant crab Kaladin did alter self to give himself gills Leopold and Zariel are automaton so they don't have to change because they don't need to breathe and Cletus swan dived into the water at sort of the base of the dome and turned into a giant octopus
Cyrus Schwert 00:06:37 let's fucking go so cool
Cletus Cobbington 00:06:39 Yes.
Dungeon Master 00:06:52 So we left off with you guys entering into this dark void of water space. You see shadows sort of at the very bottom, but distorted and dancing with the moving like kelp and like underwater grasses and
Dungeon Master 00:07:07 algae that sort of just float and hang you see distant light sources very uh drowned out and like unclear in you when you look ahead the sunlight beating through the water in front of you sort of obscures any sort of immediate sight so you sort of lose any other detail in the distance at this point but as you guys are in this open water space um your mission is clear right you know
Dungeon Master 00:07:36 You need to assess the source of whatever is drawing the water in, stop it if possible, and reactivate the teleportation circle for an easier ride home with the caveat that Kaladin's somewhat distant, nightmarish-looking uncle warned him to return to the city through ways you've traveled before, sort of hinting at you should not go through the teleportation. So you've got some sort of decision or...
Dungeon Master 00:08:05 engineering to do to sort of accommodate that. But at Odears, you have freedom to go anywhere you'd like. I will warn you, you don't know where you are in the city because you don't have a city map. There wasn't anything anybody picked up for that. So if you want to... If anybody wants to try to figure out where you are or wants to see if you can get a pretty high, I would say...
Dungeon Master 00:08:35 really like maybe dc25 history check or something to see if you know what the districts or division of moon haven was to kind of assess for where you were but what would you guys like to do first you
Kaladen Shash 00:08:49 When we were first falling, did we notice anything like the spoke pattern? Part of the city is not submerged, but could we see the spoke? Could we see a wall pattern similar to what we have?
Cletus Cobbington 00:08:54 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:09:06 All you see, one, is that it was very lush and green above the water line. The water fills most of the dome, and it's like backlogged on one end, so the water's higher at the entrance than it is towards the back of the dome. And it is still a mega city-sized dome, so it's a huge expanse of water. But you do see...
Dungeon Master 00:09:26 It's not a wall. It is distinctly different, but there is like a portion of land. You can't tell from how far you are, like what is exact shape because it's not bird view or anything like that. But there is a portion above water that seems like, I will say, just like a passing fall. You notice that it looks old, like that portion of the city was always raised above the rest.
Leopold Magnus 00:09:55 Jonathan, I'll make that history check to see if I can remember anything about the city. Nice. Plus 2, all right. That's tragic. It was a nat 20, but rolled to an 8. But not bad with the plus 2. 19. You said 25, though, didn't you?
Dungeon Master 00:10:02 Okay. Go ahead and give me a history check. You can give him a plus two. Oh. DC 25, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:10:05 Can I assist him? Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 00:10:28 He thought really hard, but he, alas.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:28 One thing. One thing that I was interested in doing so the water seems to be kind of whirlpooling down into a low spot. Is that? Like is it clear where that low spot is or is it kind of obscured?
Dungeon Master 00:10:48 From where you would be entering, so if you're looking at the map, you guys are sort of in that more dense tree area going into the water that goes. It's a huge wall of water, right? So you can go above the trees and stuff. But you don't feel like there is a down pull. There's not like you don't feel a force pulling you down.
Dungeon Master 00:11:07 there is, it's pretty still where you guys are. And if anything, you feel like you see all of the kelp and the algae in like the water fauna sort of like swaying back and forth, but it's towards you and then away from you. So there is a pole, you know, it's not backwards because the water isn't going out. So there's a general pole further into the city, but like almost level, if not above you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:11:08 was
Leopold Magnus 00:11:37 Okay. Folks, should we follow the kelp? And I'll just point out that it's kind of pointing towards a certain direction.
Cletus Cobbington 00:11:53 I dash away towards the kelp forest. I blow a lot of bubbles. Well, I can't talk. Just bubbles. All you hear is bubbles in your mind. I'm taking this role.
Dungeon Master 00:12:00 As a giant octopus. As you get closer... For no reason. You guys do have your telepathic link. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:12 No, we have a, we have the mind connection. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:12:24 I just want to say what a gift it is to myself to be a giant crab at the start of the session. That's pretty sick. I'm fucking click clacking.
Cletus Cobbington 00:12:25 I also haven't warmed up my voice yet, so. That is a gift.
Dungeon Master 00:12:31 It still needs to warm up. Is that a general map? Yes.
Kaladen Shash 00:12:44 Jonathan, you mentioned that I could feel almost like a heartbeat of the city, right? Do we seem to be moving towards that, or how often does that emanate?
Dungeon Master 00:13:03 It's a great question, actually. You do feel the same general pull that Leopold just suggested, sort of deeper into what you would consider the heart of the city. And it's not super frequent. We'll say like every 10 minutes or so, and you'll notice that it was less frequent when you were further away. So there does seem to be some sort of
Cletus Cobbington 00:13:19 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:13:26 Yes, let us continue this way. Feels right.
Dungeon Master 00:13:34 acceleration of it. It's very subtle.
Cyrus Schwert 00:13:48 Cyrus' crab walks on, like, bipedally looking like a person with, like, black arms by his side. Like he's a person shaped, but just a crab. No, not at all. My... Mm-hmm.
Kaladen Shash 00:13:59 no no no claws up to the skies dragon
Leopold Magnus 00:14:00 It's like a bipedal crab.
Cletus Cobbington 00:14:02 Your eyes are looking.
Dungeon Master 00:14:10 Cyrus, so you're at the bottom. You're at sea level. Go ahead and give me a perception check. There you go.
Cyrus Schwert 00:14:25 Sorry. I had to find crab stats. This is my norm. 19 plus something.
Dungeon Master 00:14:41 If there is a giant crab on the map, you can use that one. And then it's . 19 plus. Open monster stat block. Your perception is a minus 1. It's wisdom. So 18.
Cletus Cobbington 00:14:41 So, yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:14:56 If I'm a crab, then 0.1. What is a perception based? Oh, it's a wisdom. OK, got it. 18 is not bad for a crab. I can barely see.
Dungeon Master 00:15:12 It's really good, actually. You... You see that, like, as you're moving forward, you're, like, going into the... Like, all of the foliage and everything. And you find that you see that, like, you're actually working on worked... You're walking, scuttling, really, on worked stone at certain points. You've, like, stumbled into a main thorough way. And you see...
Cyrus Schwert 00:15:37 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:15:39 Like the remnants of old buildings, very crumbled where you are. Like at this point, it's very destroyed. But you do see that there is a sign that is like,
Dungeon Master 00:15:52 slightly bent as if it was pushed away from some sort of explosion of some kind. And it's covered in algae and hanging vines that kind of float and drift in the current. But it's definitely a sign. And you can tell there is some sort of script on it.
Cletus Cobbington 00:15:57 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:16:12 Okay. Can I walk up to it and try to crab wipe off some gunk and stuff? Are you going to read it? I actually might. Yeah. I can sure imagine so. We'll just say yes and then I'll correct you if I'm wrong when I find it.
Dungeon Master 00:16:22 Yeah, you wipe it off. Do you speak Elven as your normal character? You're a half-elf, right? It would make sense. Okay. You see...
Kaladen Shash 00:16:32 Probably does.
Dungeon Master 00:16:45 it's not Elven. It's in, um, like when it's written out, it's not very nice. It's written in Sylvan. So like the, I consider it like the cursive of the Elven language. Like it is the same language, but you have to really try hard to read out what it actually says. It's the same base words and everything, but you see that the sign reads out Mithilorn district.
Cyrus Schwert 00:17:13 Interesting. I relay that to the party as a crab through click-clack Morse code. OK, I say it in my normal voice.
Dungeon Master 00:17:14 And you would know that mithilorn roughly translates to like silverwood, which is just a type of tree. You guys hear a bunch of clicking in your head. The crowd looks a little sullen for some reason.
Cletus Cobbington 00:17:23 I will let some bubbles back.
Kaladen Shash 00:17:32 You can speak.
Cyrus Schwert 00:17:42 I'm somber. I say, there's a tree city over here. There's a sign. Is this the tree city? It's the place we are. It's showing us.
Dungeon Master 00:17:51 No, it is just like you can tell it was some sort of
Cletus Cobbington 00:17:57 Must be the wrong place. This is clearly an ocean city.
Kaladen Shash 00:18:06 So this district is the sign indicate anything else about the district? Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:18:16 brushed metal like almost coppery goldy but super faded at this point very dull um it's just a sign that spells out that district
Cyrus Schwert 00:18:29 Okay. So that's just a fact. I don't believe that's a clue.
Kaladen Shash 00:18:40 Now that we've seen the sign, do we see any other evidence of old stone buildings or maybe what sort of was in this district?
Dungeon Master 00:18:51 Yeah, you did. Cyrus spotted some buildings here as he walked up, so he can direct your attention to those. You guys are very much at the bottom of this dome level. You see there are some crumbled buildings. Most of them are very destroyed, but give me a perception check to look for ones that are still standing somewhat.
Cyrus Schwert 00:19:02 I feel like our end goal should be to go to the castle in the air, right? I think it will.
Kaladen Shash 00:19:29 Well, I mean, I think, yeah, we'll see if anyone's left there, if they survive there. But we want to find where the water is, how it's being drawn in. Here's mine.
Cyrus Schwert 00:19:39 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:19:45 Dirty 20. You see there are some buildings farther down, a couple hundred feet or so down this streetway. But you also see with a Dirty 20 that the building that is still upright, there's something a little bit off about it. There's some sort of glinting white silver
Dungeon Master 00:20:14 reflection as you walk up and you swear that after a certain point in the building it almost looks like there's a change in color to the water or something strange it's hard to tell from a distance but as you're like peeking and walking around you can tell that in the first building that you see that's not completely rubble there is something weird about it
Kaladen Shash 00:20:38 Does anyone else see this? Can other people see what they see? Something strange in the water? Yes.
Cletus Cobbington 00:20:42 I'm pretty in tune with nature.
Leopold Magnus 00:20:47 I guess, would that be a kind of magic origin? Is there a way I can make an arcana check? Oh, in nature. OK. Does anybody have, I guess, Cletus? Oh, Cletus, you're pretty in tune with nature.
Dungeon Master 00:20:54 It's actually going to be a nature check. 19.
Cletus Cobbington 00:21:12 Yeah, I'll take a gander. 19.
Dungeon Master 00:21:22 You have seen something like this before, actually. In, uh, you had, like, a shallow little sort of pond on your farm on one of the corners of the building. It was real nice. And at one point, you remember seeing that, like, it was a weird little bubble trapped underneath the water. And it was trapped in, like, spider web. You'd see, like, there was some sort of spider web. Maybe you have
Kaladen Shash 00:21:47 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:21:52 underneath the water and trapped the air, and that's how it moved around. And this is, as you guys get closer, as you instantly recognize it, this is like a giant version of that. The sort of reflecting silvery sort of shine was like lifting off of the spider silk, as it's like very tightly woven around air that's trapped in this building.
Kaladen Shash 00:22:19 Everybody keep your guard up.
Cletus Cobbington 00:22:21 Yeah, I don't like that one bit actually. Yeah, they're mega water spiders, basically what I have deduced. You know, that farm, they're real teeny, but not as big.
Cyrus Schwert 00:22:26 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:22:36 I guess should we try to be a little stealthy?
Kaladen Shash 00:22:58 Let us move forward and draw into this area in the center.
Cletus Cobbington 00:23:00 I mean, I'm a big ol' octopus, and Cyrus is a big ol' crab. We blend in as ocean folk, but... Alright, let's go.
Cyrus Schwert 00:23:00 I mean, we're in a city now. I'm a city crab.
Leopold Magnus 00:23:08 Yeah, that's true. I'm rolling it off. After you, Kaladin!
Dungeon Master 00:23:31 Sorry, which way are you guys heading? As you guys sort of move past
Kaladen Shash 00:23:41 I think just more towards what we're being drawn to for perceiving that as just like a spider's den or something, a nest of sorts.
Dungeon Master 00:23:57 you see there are like in this area at least a couple other like upright buildings but you it starts to make sense that they everything probably got destroyed at different paces but like the webbing and air bubble is also is like acting almost as like a cushion against the current so these buildings that have stuff in them sort of tied around the whole support is like
Dungeon Master 00:24:22 They're the ones that are staying upright as the water is just constantly being dragged in. It didn't have anybody in it. It was just destroyed in this area. As you move forward, you see evidence of large, long, dead tree trunks. The top of the tree is broken off and long gone, but these huge...
Dungeon Master 00:24:44 I mean, very large in like full diameter and circumference, tree bases and trunks and stumps scattered as you kind of move in. And in fact, you like brush up against one, take the algae and you see that the wood is like very light in color, white silverish before it was like petrified. And it makes a little bit more sense as you guys keep moving forward.
Dungeon Master 00:25:11 you do find that you hit a wall at some point. It's like you have to go upwards to clear it. The current theory is vague.
Kaladen Shash 00:25:23 Did we sort of follow the current to that point as well? I feel like we were sort of just
Dungeon Master 00:25:30 Where you guys are, it's not a hard pull, and you're not following it on a straight line. You have a general sense of where to go, and you're mostly following the easiest path through this abandoned, demolished city. So you're just sort of going through the clear spaces with the exact current.
Kaladen Shash 00:25:50 Does this wall look like the walls in our domes that divide the districts?
Dungeon Master 00:25:57 Uh, no, they, um, the it's, it's definitely worked stone, but to what extent you can't super tell it's carved into something, but is like very elven in design, smooth edges, any sort of, um, undulation in the wall is like very gradual and rounded and very elegant looking. Um, but as you look up, it doesn't,
Cletus Cobbington 00:26:03 Bye.
Cyrus Schwert 00:26:15 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:26:25 It doesn't seem like a wall, I'll say. There's no breaks in it. You don't see an obvious walkway. You guys have the ability to swim, so if you went upwards, you guys would start to see that it, in fact, is like a tier. You're at a bottom rung, and then you go up, and then it just levels out after a certain height, and you see new evidence of city, more buildings intact, but this area is also still fully underwater.
Cyrus Schwert 00:26:52 Like a pyramid up to one corner. Generally speaking.
Dungeon Master 00:26:56 So almost like a fountain, like a pyramid slash fountain where it's just like large sprawling base and then up a level stair sort of step as it gets to the very top. It's being pulled up, yes.
Leopold Magnus 00:27:11 And the water is running uphill. Interesting. So it's being pulled up these giant steps. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:27:24 generally do we see yeah no do we see now any remaining buildings do we see evidence of like other still standing or metal signs do we catch a different district name
Cyrus Schwert 00:27:26 Because his scent is like kind of vague with the current. It's not like just like rushing.
Dungeon Master 00:27:47 Yeah, you look around and you see that, you see like broken structure and you make out with enough time just looking at it. There is like once a large spiraling sort of staircase that connected the low area to the high area and like almost ramped like two. And you see like the bare minimum at the very top and the bottom had just collapsed. And as you sort of swamble, say like leftwards,
Dungeon Master 00:28:13 into the water this huge void space that you're just sort of staying at the bottom of you do see eventually see a sign and i know you speak this so i don't need to like have you roll for it but it says still fane district and you know that sylphane roughly translates from like elven to comet as sycamore which is just a different tree
Leopold Magnus 00:28:46 Jonathan is there any intact structures that are high up like a viewpoint or elevated position? Like you were mentioned that there was some buildings that were still kind of structurally sound that might might be elevated kind of above everything above the water even. Something that you could climb.
Dungeon Master 00:28:52 What do you mean? Where you are, no. Like, to put it into perspective, right, you know that New New Arbor would take like a full day of a brisk walk to get from one end to the other.
Kaladen Shash 00:29:06 Yes.
Dungeon Master 00:29:17 Like that's how big it was. This dome looked the exact same. You entered from the southwest aspect and you had seen when you were falling like bare pieces of buildings and stuff that were outside of the water at the far end of the dome. So you are still like a pretty long ways away from anything that could be tall enough to be out. You're sort of at the very lowest portion.
Dungeon Master 00:29:39 And the city, you're finding, is very much laid out. Like, if you were looking at a marble, let's say, it would have, like, almost a stair design of something in the center, where, like, it is a large, rounded stair, up stair, and it sort of converges to a back corner-ish, if marbles could have corners. Like, everything sort of goes up and back. And so it makes sense that you would see buildings sort of out at that point, like, still in the water area.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:39 Okay, got it.
Kaladen Shash 00:29:40 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:30:07 But you're very far down in the city and at the back corner, almost like it was designed to be that way, mechanically speaking. I was going to make a map about it, but I'm out of time.
Kaladen Shash 00:30:19 cool you
Leopold Magnus 00:30:21 Yeah, got it. That's helpful. Thank you. So would we know any lore about this particular, like there was some amount of information we would have been given, right? Like,
Cletus Cobbington 00:30:39 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:30:41 Yeah. As you're sort of going through this area, anybody who wants to can give me another sort of history check. 27. It just sort of clicks.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:58 I'll do one. There it is.
Kaladen Shash 00:31:00 Sounds good. Excellent, my friend.
Dungeon Master 00:31:11 You didn't remember it at first for 23.2. But as you've read these two street signs now, you'd access a deep memory that you forgot you had. Something that constantly happened is part of your character, so it's very much on theme.
Cyrus Schwert 00:31:11 Yeah, it is.
Cletus Cobbington 00:31:14 Hello.
Dungeon Master 00:31:29 But you know that Moonhaven being very fey in influence, a heavy concentration of elves went there because of the type of magic that came out from the magic wellspring. It just was very fey in nature.
Dungeon Master 00:31:44 so the whole city is very elven um everything is built nature themed you know you had buildings built on trees and stuff and it was very cascading ramps and railings uh everything is very wood and like the stone on the ground is really the only portion that's not like wood-based um
Cletus Cobbington 00:31:53 And.
Dungeon Master 00:32:09 And there are six distinct districts of Moonhaven. And you know them to be, after you just remember it, Mythelorn, Silphane, Valewith, Alarian, Larendel, and Calathiel. And all of those have different tree meanings. You know, obviously, Mythelorn is Silverwood now.
Dungeon Master 00:32:37 uh veil with is willow sylphane sycamore which is where you've just entered into alerion is uh known as an lr tree um which is just like a the very classic elf tree design if you think lord of the rings like the trees in the main city that they go into at one point not rivendell but the very like
Cyrus Schwert 00:32:45 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:33:02 tall cascading ones where the canopy sort of branches out and it almost looks like a spade in design. That's what like the LR tree is equivalent to. Larendel is the Elven word for tulip tree. And Calathiel, C-A-L-A-T-H-I-E-L. Give me a religion check to see if you know what that one means.
Kaladen Shash 00:33:09 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:33:31 Uh, yeah, 20.
Dungeon Master 00:33:37 20 uh it is like a holy term for elves um you know the fey don't really believe they don't acknowledge but they don't put their faith in like divine celestial beings everything is very nature-based but this roughly translates to like tree of light which would be like the holy tree of the religion
Leopold Magnus 00:34:00 In that district. Right. OK, interesting. Yeah, all.
Dungeon Master 00:34:03 Yeah, so that's basically like, you know how New New Arbor is laid out. There is the like the cleric district, the Don district. This is like the equivalent of that. This is their sort of holy designation of the city. And that is what you remember.
Cletus Cobbington 00:34:05 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:34:27 Turn to Kaladin and I'll say, Kaladin, how's that mask? Is there any wild magic around? No, I'm not sure what you're talking about. Must be something to do with that mask.
Dungeon Master 00:34:33 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:34:36 Can anyone else feel the pulse of the city? It happens every now and then. Yes, I don't see anything, but I certainly feel something.
Cyrus Schwert 00:35:03 Psycho, it's leading us to it like a like a wafting fresh hot almond pie in the window. So we're like floating like Tom and Jerry.
Leopold Magnus 00:35:04 Well, I think it's best you lead the way.
Cletus Cobbington 00:35:10 Let the inspiration of the roasted almond guide us. Hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:35:16 slowly making our way it is water floating along yeah can we can we
Cyrus Schwert 00:35:35 I'm bipedally floating along like Tom.
Dungeon Master 00:35:39 Oh.
Cletus Cobbington 00:35:42 You know how octopuses can camouflage and morph their bodies? I'm perfectly morphed into Jerry right now. With a really wonky, swole-ass bulldog.
Kaladen Shash 00:35:50 But do I continue to feel the pull of where we're moving towards? Jonathan, like you said, this is like a big step.
Kaladen Shash 00:36:11 Is it like hundreds of yards to the next one? Can we see through the water enough to see like the next tier? Or is it where we just kind of moving forward?
Dungeon Master 00:36:12 Like I hinted at before, the space in between is so large and the loss of light that traveling through water is so great at this point. The depth you are at that you don't see...
Cletus Cobbington 00:36:20 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:36:40 far enough away to see like the wall of anything like as you're moving forward things are coming into your view from just like the shadowy darkness of water it's almost like you guys are looking forward but it would be the equivalent of like looking down in the ocean like you just lose the light at some point and so you all you really see in your immediate view at all times is sort of the light trickling in and illuminating things as you move forward
Kaladen Shash 00:36:58 Okay. Cool. Yes, let us continue this way. Graveyard.
Cyrus Schwert 00:37:07 is there stuff like swimming around like there's little fish going around and stuff like this is an ecosystem that's alive or are we just walking through a fucking ghost town okay
Dungeon Master 00:37:20 You see little bits of evidence of little fish schools or an eel of very normal size gathered around the base of things at the remaining buildings. Because again, in this district, as you're moving around, there is a heavier concentration of broken trees, but the buildings are more intact now.
Cletus Cobbington 00:37:42 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:37:46 for some reason you're not sure what happened right um so you see there's like a lot of nature has reclaimed these buildings but you could go check them out if you guys wanted to and in them you see the fish concentrations moving through and the denser areas of all the grasses and everything looking up or around it is dead it's like um please like a ghost town it is
Cyrus Schwert 00:37:48 Right.
Dungeon Master 00:38:13 what do they call it in the ocean? Just the dead space in between. Yeah. Like a dead zone. Essentially. You just don't see any, anything yet necessarily. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:38:16 Dead Zone. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:38:17 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:38:26 it feels like like if the fish are only inside and they don't want to come out there must be something hunting them out right there's got to be something bigger why wouldn't they just all be swimming around why would they be huddling maybe we should swim lean in stealth or something as we go but just go along
Kaladen Shash 00:38:56 Little closer to the buildings, perhaps. You're a giant crab. Yeah, can we see what they would have been... I mean, are they standing enough to maybe understand, like, are there signs outside saying what they used to do, sell, make, what this district might have been?
Leopold Magnus 00:39:03 Well, yeah, it seems prudent to me
Dungeon Master 00:39:08 as you guys move forward, do you want to check out? Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:39:25 Yeah, as you move through this district, you put it together. There's one, a lack of signs and stuff. You see a couple, and the ones that you do see are very suburban park signs. They're low to the ground in front of an empty space where grass is way overgrown in the mixture of water and stuff. And it's very obviously a common space, a park space.
Dungeon Master 00:39:54 and the houses that are there uh well i gave it away the buildings that are around our houses you see rooms divided up there's like a hearth that is long since just filled and empty and like not even really at this point evidence of ash just the space where the hearth would be and you can you
Dungeon Master 00:40:14 can sort of gather that you're moving through like a residential district of the city large trees open parks nice homes common spaces um there's trinkets here and there like you see just like boots trapped under a log floating up but like can't get out things like that as you move through
Kaladen Shash 00:40:20 Okay. Little bit.
Cletus Cobbington 00:40:39 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:40:42 This is a little creepy. I think we just keep on trucking if we're not seeing anything exciting. I mean, we got as much of a history check that we possibly could have. Unless we see something.
Kaladen Shash 00:41:00 I agree. Yeah, can we continue this?
Leopold Magnus 00:41:07 Well, I think Kaladin probably has a good sense of where we should go.
Cyrus Schwert 00:41:15 I mean, I don't care. Let's just cook it. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:41:19 As you guys pass through the district, you notice a couple changes. One, Kaladin, at some point, because you guys do have to go up, so you're sort of following the ground to avoid danger, but as you hit the next rise of this nice-looking wall, you see carvings of elven figures and poses just into the wall, scenes depicted. It gets very nice, and you can tell you move into a wall, and it's almost like ivory. It's so white and glistening in the water.
Dungeon Master 00:41:49 um and you keep moving up and then you hit the next level and the the sensation you catch like the pulse you get a good one right as you sort of pressed up and it's very much just parallel with the ground of where you are it's like you move forward not up now and you can feel and notice like caledon you would be i think the only one who would really notice it is like your hair
Kaladen Shash 00:42:01 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:42:14 is is sort of flowing forward and almost into your eyes as the water has a noticeable draw from where you guys are and looking around you do see when you look up it's not just the light that is like cascading through a full thing of water you almost see what you would describe as like ripples and the water is like very much like shining and glistening in instead of just being present you are much closer to the surface you hit sort of this other area
Kaladen Shash 00:42:48 Okay, can we see a sign in this area?
Leopold Magnus 00:42:48 John in the studio.
Dungeon Master 00:42:55 Yeah, you guys see that this district, as you find the sign at some point, long search along the riser, and you find the staircase eventually, is Larendell. This is the tulip tree district. And Calvin, you understand that the tulip tree is very commonly associated with artisanship.
Dungeon Master 00:43:22 trade and art and culture and as you guys see these different areas like this this strikes you more of like a um mercantile district trade happened here the art happened here so you see like a little um stadium outside like just built in benches down to the bottom um
Dungeon Master 00:43:48 And then the feel we feel for Drew is his history is not nearly as stick-in-the-hole as Jeroen's is. I would say you guys have been doing the same thing for a couple of hours in a month or so. I mean, I'm saying maybe towards the end of this past year. Jeroen's story is fine. As you can foretell, it works out.
Dungeon Master 00:44:17 And you feel that your whole is kind of that way.
Kaladen Shash 00:44:43 towards the tree of life and history. Excellent. Let us continue this way.
Dungeon Master 00:44:47 Yes. But the current is pulling up. So you guys' trajectory would be changing. And the current is now sort of pulling up. The source of the water is getting much more noticeable.
Leopold Magnus 00:44:47 Can I keep my eyes open?
Kaladen Shash 00:45:05 I've explained all of the water. They're certainly going to go that way, but my mask and senses are drawing this way. What do I do?
Cyrus Schwert 00:45:22 But I just want to make sure you don't get stuck at the bottom of the pool in the drain. That's dangerous. My parents always told me not to get stuck in the drain. That's all. And I'm scared.
Leopold Magnus 00:45:32 Well, maybe we should pay instincts first. That seems like a rational fear. Was that a real problem for you growing up as a young type? Indeed.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:41 Let the side mission. Yes. Can we start working against the current a little bit?
Cyrus Schwert 00:45:52 I think it was a bigger anxiety than it was an actual danger, probably. We keep following the intuition.
Leopold Magnus 00:46:04 No, John, I was going to say like. What was I?
Kaladen Shash 00:46:12 go towards what we feel.
Dungeon Master 00:46:13 Yeah, and you even hear Azariel kind of clip up at this point. He goes, yeah, well, I reckon we can do both things eventually, but let's just pick this one first. And you guys move forward. And it's just what you find, like, a very pleasant, like, walk, essentially. Like, you're on a very street path, and it's
Dungeon Master 00:46:43 um you know parky and you see like sculptures long broken and fallen of elven figures very beautifully sculpted and then you see tombstones at some point and you're like in a a burial site um and then you keep moving forward and then you find a large like 15 foot tall wooden
Kaladen Shash 00:47:09 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:47:10 door that has like two elven figures with their hands outstretched like carved into it and you see above this you actually see the words um telathiel so this seems like an entrance of some kind and you're just walking up the entrance the walkway
Cyrus Schwert 00:47:36 Oh, I see. Hi.
Cletus Cobbington 00:47:37 Send it. I got plus three as a giant octopus.
Kaladen Shash 00:47:38 Cindy, yeah. Can you move forward? That is not my best action.
Dungeon Master 00:47:41 Who wants to give me like a strength check to move these large doors underwater?
Leopold Magnus 00:47:52 Who's the most beefy of us all? Oh, I'm fairly sturdy. Oh, much stronger than me. You have one really tiny arm.
Cyrus Schwert 00:48:05 I only have a plus one as a crab. My crusher claw isn't very big. I haven't been working out. I'm more of a city crab. Yeah. Wow, what a loser. Let's all fight him.
Kaladen Shash 00:48:12 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:48:17 I think he's a dex character, though. His strength is plus zero. You're all pretty comfortable. Cletus, go ahead and give me that roll, and you add plus two to it from Leopold's health. Natural twenty. Twenty-three plus two, twenty-five.
Cletus Cobbington 00:48:28 Octopus it is. I got six extra arms.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:30 I'll assist.
Cyrus Schwert 00:48:36 That's one buff octopus.
Dungeon Master 00:48:47 Hell of a check. You, um... You're like... All of your arms, all six of them, are pressing on the door, and you're using your little, like, aqua jets that octopuses have. You're pushing water through to push yourself forward a little bit more. Leopold's at the bottom, pressing the door, and you guys hear that, like, dull underwater thud of, like, the... As you see bubbles disrupt from... You guys are expelling, and you see something from behind the door.
Kaladen Shash 00:48:54 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:49:17 It was just disrupted. I shouldn't have said bubbles. There's like... Bubbles wouldn't make sense. Disrupted as the door opens and Cletus, you can even get in first because an octopus can fit through anything that its beak can. So you switch and you go like as soon as the door is cracked, you go into the other side and you see before anybody else this is a
Dungeon Master 00:49:39 tall but it gets less tall it goes from being like 15 feet to like 12 and then to 10 feet tall of this tunnel with this artwork that is just descending and spiraling into the ground so it gets very dark um and as you pull the door open everybody sort of catches this a second later um
Cletus Cobbington 00:49:47 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:49:58 The water's colder out of the light. You don't see any light sources immediately in it, but it just goes into a dark tunnel. And Kaladin, you feel at this point like another pulse kind of pings you from the darkness somewhere deep in there. Yes.
Kaladen Shash 00:50:16 Deep inside the tunnel.
Leopold Magnus 00:50:20 I go to help Cletus in his squid form, and the whole door just falls open before I can even touch it. And I kind of dust myself off after I tripped a bit, and I go, well, I think I loosened it for you.
Cletus Cobbington 00:50:33 I have two swole tentacles, and the other ones are still defined. But I got a pump in my main shoulders. I do a quick, what are those competitions called? It's just like the muscular man competition.
Dungeon Master 00:50:34 You got a pump going, actually. You did so much work there. They're nicely toned. Mr. Olympia.
Cyrus Schwert 00:50:39 Bubbles. That's obvious. You're doing posing.
Kaladen Shash 00:50:52 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:51:03 The Arnold Classic. You're Sam Sulik, you know?
Cletus Cobbington 00:51:04 I'm super dark bronze right now. Yeah. Hell yeah. You know how old bikers and muscle men would have the octopus tattoo? I just have a tattoo of a really strong, swole dude on my shoulder right now.
Cyrus Schwert 00:51:14 Perfect. Yes. I think so. Oh.
Leopold Magnus 00:51:18 Well,
Dungeon Master 00:51:29 Oh, canon. Point of order. Travis, you are under polymorph, correct? Polymorph only lasts an hour, right? Pretty sure. So maybe it's less. Polymorph.
Kaladen Shash 00:51:37 Oh, Jonathan, you know what? Alter self is the same.
Cletus Cobbington 00:51:44 i believe so oh it's stopped right now
Cyrus Schwert 00:51:44 I'm going to die.
Dungeon Master 00:51:59 I got it right here. Duration. One hour. So I will say it's been three plus hours at this point. Do you guys have the spell economy to keep this up? Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 00:52:14 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:52:18 Oh, Jesus.
Kaladen Shash 00:52:18 I would have, so I think I would have burned the spell to the first time and then taken that potion at some point. Underwater and just, I'll just, and I'll just drag, I'll just, I'll be dragged along. Is the potion only an hour as well?
Dungeon Master 00:52:30 So burn it for one hour, and then you get water breathing, which I think is one hour. Let me look. For one hour.
Cyrus Schwert 00:52:52 We don't really have many other options. All right. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:52:56 We don't, we only got two of those. I think everyone got two. I just have two in my inventory, but that would make sense. Yep. So it's still a four.
Cletus Cobbington 00:52:57 No.
Leopold Magnus 00:53:01 I think I gave you guys mine. That's right.
Dungeon Master 00:53:04 Yeah. But you guys had burned... You had burned at least, I think, two in the Mind Flayer dungeon or accident. You had the... You've used the two. I will say, maybe this is a panic moment. You do have the option to go ahead of you deeper into this. You do see there is water...
Dungeon Master 00:53:30 A surface of the water somewhere above you. And you've seen it the whole time, although it's getting much less dense. It's way more sparse as you move closer to the center of the city from the opening and the outside. But you do see those little air bubbles surrounded by spider webbing. Very occasionally in certain buildings at this point, not all of them.
Cyrus Schwert 00:53:42 Hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 00:53:57 And those are like huge, like filling up the room, right?
Dungeon Master 00:54:01 Yeah. Well, some of them you've seen because this is, again, over the span of hours and you were going through huge gaps and you're finding more pieces of city. Sometimes you guys swear you see what look like tunnelways connecting certain buildings that are above water. And then there's like not once you and you can make the assumption that the next one's underground. But there's like just trapped air that makes this intricate network of air walkways in this underwater city.
Leopold Magnus 00:54:34 So how long did you have on the potion? Only two hours? Well, certainly let's go.
Cyrus Schwert 00:54:38 They are walkways.
Cletus Cobbington 00:54:41 You know, why don't we pop in one of these buildings and seems to be air in there. We can at least get some air. We got to fight a bit. We can, you know, see what happens. See if big mama spiders home. And if not, we can pop in, borrow some air.
Kaladen Shash 00:54:48 Investigate that. Might be able to move. Take a break. Let us explore.
Dungeon Master 00:55:13 You guys move into one of the buildings. We'll just say somebody give me an encounter check real quick to see if this is a good building or not. I want that. B20.
Kaladen Shash 00:55:24 Who's got the hot hand? Everybody's rolling. Boop, man. Somebody do it. Somebody did it. Somebody get it. Give us four.
Leopold Magnus 00:55:26 Yeah. Average.
Cyrus Schwert 00:55:33 I can do it. You said a D4 or D20? I'm sorry. Okay, perfect. Don't give me a one. Okay. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:55:41 D20.
Dungeon Master 00:55:50 lot and and um it just seems like um you see like some spots untouched like very old soaked just like paper that is just underwater and you feel like you know actually that if you touched it it would just disintegrate but like some sort of parchment shop of like
Dungeon Master 00:56:12 long overtaken counter some sort of shelf behind that shows stuff and like through the doorway into the ground you see a like it's hard to describe like a tunnel way that is just completely surrounded with spider web and there's an air bubble in it look in trapped in beneath it you almost cut at the weird spot but then you're like oh shit if I cut this anywhere but the bottom the air will escape
Cyrus Schwert 00:56:35 It's.
Cletus Cobbington 00:56:39 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:56:42 So you go to the bottom of it, you make like a slit and you open it up. And when you open the difference in pressure does like start to let water in. But when you put your head in, it is a,
Dungeon Master 00:56:55 um what you would expect to have been dark space but you see like bioluminescent uh like funguses and mushrooms fleeing to like the air and the spider web lighting up the tunnel in certain spots as it goes down and forward you can tell like into another building um water's rushing in this is an empty space you don't see any dangers right away at least but um it is breathable air
Kaladen Shash 00:57:10 Fascinating. Great.
Cyrus Schwert 00:57:26 So I turn back into Cyrus probably, right? Are we like on certain kind of timer for that?
Dungeon Master 00:57:27 Well, what happened is you would have had the full hour and then he could have cast it one more time.
Dungeon Master 00:57:54 Because he doesn't need to use it. He's just a robot. This could come from Zariel. And then so you get two out of it. I don't think he's got more than that. But then you would use the potion for the third one. He's got... He's got two third levels. So he could have done one and then a second one. So yeah, you are...
Cyrus Schwert 00:57:57 Got it. Okay. So I'm still a crab in theory. Gotcha.
Dungeon Master 00:58:23 You are still a crab, but if you stay in the water, we'll have to use the other potion, or you can leave it for Paladin. Or you can go in the tunnel and not need it. And you'll change back to Cyrus' attack.
Kaladen Shash 00:58:35 Yes. Yes, we're getting close. Let us do this.
Cyrus Schwert 00:58:39 I think we should go in that tunnel. I think we should ride the roller coaster of spiders. The spiderweb air tunnel. Great. This is perfect.
Cletus Cobbington 00:58:46 I have one more hour as octopus me. Also, while I'm in actual air, I have to hold my breath. Trade of a giant octopus. Hold breath while out of water. Octopus can hold its breath for an hour. I'm just getting lightheaded.
Leopold Magnus 00:58:47 Indeed. I'm going.
Dungeon Master 00:59:00 You lose your hard form. Yeah, go for it.
Kaladen Shash 00:59:04 It's true, this is true. And just turn into a pile of mush.
Cyrus Schwert 00:59:16 it's the same problem
Cletus Cobbington 00:59:20 I'm back to a noodle boy. Is it like the avatar plants?
Leopold Magnus 00:59:24 Jonathan, can I make a nature check for this bioluminescence stuff in the tunnel? Ooh. 23.
Dungeon Master 00:59:36 It gives that for sure. 23 is really good. It is nothing crazy, but you can, looking at it, 23 is good. I'll give you something extra. This is a species of, obviously, bioluminescent plant and fungus. Traditionally only found, you've read about this in a botany book, in the Feywild. This is an exotic species.
Kaladen Shash 00:59:40 Bye.
Cletus Cobbington 00:59:56 Bonus question on that. So their faith.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:03 Imported plants, I suppose.
Cyrus Schwert 01:00:20 Let's see.
Cletus Cobbington 01:00:25 are these like aquatic plants or are these plants okay but they're still like chilling and glowing they're just underwater now okay ah right right
Dungeon Master 01:00:29 No. Mm-hmm. Pretty much only exist because they're in this airspace. Yeah, and you get really close. You do also find that if you touch the inside of the webbing, it is a little sticky. There's spots where you can see
Leopold Magnus 01:00:42 Like a spider web tunnel.
Cletus Cobbington 01:00:55 All right.
Dungeon Master 01:00:56 spiders that put, like, their little red things in to make it catch right there. And you really close to see where the certain plants and fungus light up. And you see their roots are, like, intricately spread through the thick webbing of the spider cell. The tubes absorb water when they want it, and they've got the oxygen to convert in the tunnel space. And there are, you know, fungus in certain species of plants. They probably don't need, like, actual sunlight.
Cyrus Schwert 01:01:00 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:22 you
Dungeon Master 01:01:27 I would say nothing more than you would already know. You don't, to your knowledge, there is no
Leopold Magnus 01:01:32 I don't know anything about webs, like spiders and webs. Is there any kind of knowledge of creatures that do this kind of thing?
Dungeon Master 01:01:57 giant spider species that is purely aquatic. This is just like an extension of some sort of normal spider. And this is a phenomenon that spiders actually do. This is normal behavior to some extent. This is just a large example. So you'd figure like you saw a bunch of different types of spiders that chased you before. This is
Cletus Cobbington 01:02:15 Only that one at the door.
Dungeon Master 01:02:22 It's probably just something like that. Like, a spider colony has taken root underground and sort of invaded the city. You hear you chill down on your spineless back when you say that.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:46 Hey, come back.
Cletus Cobbington 01:02:53 I know this to be true. It has to be. All right. I think we are going down the tunnel.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:53 Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:02:57 All right. This all happened much quicker than in real time because, again, as soon as Cyrus opened up water, started pouring it in, so you guys, like,
Cyrus Schwert 01:03:14 and relate to Canada.
Dungeon Master 01:03:23 close it real quick, have this quick dialogue in your head, and you all sort of pop into the tunnel, and you feel as you step in, and you put actual weight on the tunnel. It is sort of suspended in water and space. The whole thing sort of vibrates and jiggles a little bit as your sort of weights hit it. And then you close it up, the tunnel behind you looks like this.
Dungeon Master 01:03:49 and everything sort of equalizes. Are you staying as octopus in crap?
Cyrus Schwert 01:04:01 No. I don't know how to...
Cletus Cobbington 01:04:02 I would really love to, but I'm going to suffocate myself, so I'll disable it. I'm going to de-animate more of myself at the back of it or the front covers of those.
Dungeon Master 01:04:23 You come out here in normal form. Sorry, I didn't hear what you had said. Same thing. Perfect. Okay. All in your humanoid forms. And then again, I'll just get it up in order to get it straight.
Cyrus Schwert 01:04:40 Same thing.
Dungeon Master 01:04:50 As you guys make this last-minute decision for goodbye for air, Kaladin, you do feel one more of one of those pulses, and it is behind. It's not the same direction. A temporary detour, perhaps, you'll have to take. But as you guys make your way into this dark area, you pass this link.
Cletus Cobbington 01:05:00 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:05:12 Perhaps. Perhaps. Something to blame.
Dungeon Master 01:05:22 Everybody, we will do a quick break. I think we'll play until like 11, maybe like 10 or 10.30, 10 or something. We'll take a quick break up. Next we'll...
Cyrus Schwert 01:05:37 Thank you. Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:38 Why is the . Sorry, what were you saying?
Kaladen Shash 01:05:51 Hey, Rex, when's your race, man? Did you say it was in June or July? Did you just mute? I missed that. Oh, no, I was asking, when's your race? What's the bar? Yeah, exactly. When is your race?
Leopold Magnus 01:06:09 I think I'll be alright. I just gotta keep running. Which is starting to get kind of boring now.
Cyrus Schwert 01:06:14 Yeah, I mean, is that when you're researching? Oh, that's a long last time. How long are you going? The time last time.
Kaladen Shash 01:06:24 Okay, cool. It'd be like audiobook. Podcasting.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:44 Yeah, dude, I actually have. I used to listen to music, but I have been switching to podcasts because I'm kind of like going slow. But like trying to get lots more miles. Oh, actually, that's a great point. Okay. Yeah, that's a great idea because I have been meaning to listen to that. But I don't know if Megan will put up with it in a car. Yeah, which one do you like? Which one do you recommend?
Cyrus Schwert 01:06:55 Have you listened to D&D podcasts by chance before? There are a lot of... There are... There's like three main ones, basically. Critical Role is the most popular and definitely has the most hours of listening time. They're not highly edited, so sometimes
Kaladen Shash 01:07:01 Yeah, those would be great. Travis, what do you like to listen to?
Leopold Magnus 01:07:23 Okay. Interesting. Yeah, that's awesome. That's a lot of catalog. Just listen. Yeah, I think I have one question.
Cyrus Schwert 01:07:25 The sessions are long. They're like four-hour sessions. They're not edited at all. They play live. Jonathan really loves that one. It's the most popular one. People love it, for sure. The back catalog is sick. They're like the famous show. They're an Amazon Prime show. It's based on their campaign and stuff.
Cletus Cobbington 01:07:37 the main guy for that is super famous.
Kaladen Shash 01:07:37 Yep.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:51 One season, maybe a partial season. I remember liking it a lot. That show was dope, yeah. A lot of strapping. But yeah, so... That's very dope. No, she didn't say Derek.
Cyrus Schwert 01:08:00 My favorite, personally, is not another DVD podcast. That's kind of, that's where we started. No, that's Dungeons and Daddies. I have listened to that.
Cletus Cobbington 01:08:07 Woohoo!
Kaladen Shash 01:08:08 Is that the one where they play with their dad and stuff? Okay. Yeah, there you go. That's what I'm thinking of. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:08:11 Oh, very funny. No, that is... Well, that's Guns N' Daddies. Ren, you're thinking of Adventure Zone. That is the McElroy family. And their first campaign is...
Leopold Magnus 01:08:24 What's that about? That sounds cool. Okay. Yeah. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:08:36 It's called The Balance Campaign. It's one of my favorite D&D stories ever. It's really good. I just didn't like what they did next, so I stopped listening to it. But Rex, you should really listen to another D&D podcast, also called NADDPod. Incredibly funny. Really, the first episode, campaign one, episode one, starts off hot talking about dragon pussy. That's like one of the first things that's said at all.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:55 Oh my God. That's great. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:08:57 It's very good. Like we went. Yeah. I'm obsessed with that one. It's my favorite. The most fast. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:09:07 I have four more episodes till I'm caught up again with campaign one, my third re-listen.
Dungeon Master 01:09:14 Hell yeah. It's so good. They just finished their campaign three. That one's much shorter. It's like 40 minute to an hour long episodes. And they do like, like the longest one was a hundred episodes for campaign one. And then it was like 50 episodes.
Cletus Cobbington 01:09:37 campaign one for nadpod you will instantly understand everything that is cletus basically i am extremely influenced off of the druid from that campaign
Dungeon Master 01:09:37 And then I think pretty similar for three. And then Critical Role is like 150 episodes each campaign. And every episode is four or four hours long. So it's thousands of hours of listening. Yeah. Moonshine.
Cyrus Schwert 01:09:37 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:39 That's fucking great. Yeah, lots of content. That's funny. Right on. That's great.
Kaladen Shash 01:09:58 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:10:07 Pretty much. It's the style of D&D that I like to play. I mean, or like to listen to at the very least. It's very exciting to listen to. Yeah, that's all I listen to. And then the last one is Dimension 20. That's the super popular one, too. Those are like the biggest three, probably. And that's also excellent.
Cletus Cobbington 01:10:10 Because she plays it so good. You know what? Yeah. Trav and I's stupid jokes is that style. So that's why we play D&D like this.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:24 Nice. That's funny. OK. Well, it seems like a large back catalog of literally everything. So I'll check out. Yeah, I'll just roll this. Check one out. That's excellent, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:10:27 Um, yeah, I started with NAD pod and then I listened to critical role.
Cyrus Schwert 01:10:41 Yeah, honestly, there is a lot for anyone.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:55 Okay. Maybe I'll watch that one. Check it out. Because, yeah, I haven't seen any content related to D&D. It's kind of cool to me that people put that together. I didn't know. Maybe. Oh. Follow me. Yes. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:11:04 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:11:05 Rex, are you familiar with what was, like, Dropout? The YouTube channel? Like, do you know the Jake and Amir show at all? So, Jake... Yeah, college humor, that's what I should have said. Jake is one of the D&D players in NADOD, because it's Jake...
Kaladen Shash 01:11:12 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:11:24 Your college humor is today. Yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:29 Oh, that's great. And they just play D&D. Oh, that's great.
Dungeon Master 01:11:32 murphy and brian murphy and emily axford who are all from college humor and caldwell tanner so they're all comedians by training for like very popular jokes of like our age group generally so that's it's why it's so funny is it's just and they just play dnd
Cletus Cobbington 01:11:46 yeah yeah the dm and his wife have been playing dnd together for a fucking long time so like campaign one of madpod was jake's first time ever touching anything that's dnd related
Cyrus Schwert 01:11:53 So they're all improv people, and that's Dimension 20 as well. It's kind of the same family.
Leopold Magnus 01:12:06 That's great. Right. Yeah. That's great.
Cletus Cobbington 01:12:12 And as, like, they would describe anything nerd-related, like, he's so straight-laced and that kind of thing. But, like, it's him being, like... It's funny seeing him just, like, get obsessed with it really quick. And, like, now they've been doing it for fucking years. That's cool. We saw him in Portland a couple years ago. That's sick.
Dungeon Master 01:12:17 He's so cool.
Cyrus Schwert 01:12:32 Yeah, it took off and that's their job. Yeah, sick. Yeah. Yeah, it did. I caught his D20. Pretty sick. Yeah, anyway. Long tangent, but...
Leopold Magnus 01:12:40 Oh, they even do live sessions. Okay. There you go. You know, you can make a big as a as a dungeon dungeon playing group and a group of adventures. No, thanks for the recommendations. I'm gonna I'm gonna have to take a look at those. I'll get back to you after I listen to a couple.
Cletus Cobbington 01:12:43 Trav got a dice from Jake. Oh, yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:13:05 That's good stuff.
Dungeon Master 01:13:17 Alrighty, guys. Let's get back into it. How do you guys want to proceed in this tunnel? Marching order and just general...
Cletus Cobbington 01:13:24 you're...
Leopold Magnus 01:13:37 I would prefer... Oh, indeed. No, I eventually...
Kaladen Shash 01:13:37 like an order, like a marching order. Quietly, now that we're moving through spider web, perhaps. I'm not too slow, but cautious.
Dungeon Master 01:13:45 way you're going to do it. What's the vibe? Does one of you have boots of Elvenkind? Is that something that actually is one of you actually has? Or is that just a joke that was
Cyrus Schwert 01:13:56 Yeah. Yeah, we're thinking of doing that in the future.
Kaladen Shash 01:14:05 No, I think that was just a good reference that they're great to have. We're telegraphing somebody that's monitoring this thing where we are.
Cletus Cobbington 01:14:09 uh
Leopold Magnus 01:14:09 Yeah, we're going to get there. We'll have them eventually, but not now. Ooh, strategize.
Dungeon Master 01:14:13 That would be clutch because you were like, you make zero sound and you're almost weightless. Like as far as your feet go with boots of oven kind. So they're like really, they're real key for that shit. Potentially. You're back.
Cletus Cobbington 01:14:40 I have an idea for me, but DM ran away right when I was going to say it. I just want to wild shape into the giant wolf spider, because they have crazy web stuff. Web sense. While in contact with the web, spider knows exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.
Cyrus Schwert 01:14:46 What is it? That's great. Can't wait for you to tell them that. Yeah, but we could do it back.
Leopold Magnus 01:14:54 Oh, that's a great idea. Well, yeah, so they have a beat on us like right now.
Kaladen Shash 01:14:59 Oh yes. Now you could still communicate with us.
Cletus Cobbington 01:15:09 Well, that's why I conjured them last time, but it didn't really. We were just kind of booking it, so there wasn't really any time for it to really matter. But that could only help us in this situation, I think.
Cyrus Schwert 01:15:19 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:31 Yeah, no, that would be that'd be big. I was just looking. I don't really have anything. Interesting I could do.
Dungeon Master 01:15:44 I'm back. I was listening. I just muted myself because I had to pee really bad. You could absolutely do that, Cletus. In fact, I was going to do that for Zarya if nobody else had. You transform. How do you look at the spider?
Kaladen Shash 01:15:54 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:15:56 Okay, I'll do it. Break my spine into it. I'm loving the anamorph style, but I just start elongating, breaking. There's a bunch of limbs come out of my back, and then I'm just... Yet again, I have eight legs. It's like I'm so crackly. It's so painful looking.
Cyrus Schwert 01:16:15 Oh. Cyrus throws up. That was disgusting. I'm going to bore.
Dungeon Master 01:16:17 It's weirdly set up with slow motion. And what is the range on your websites? What is the exact wording?
Cletus Cobbington 01:16:26 Seemingly infinite. It says, while in contact with a web, the spider knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.
Dungeon Master 01:16:50 Oh, I love this. You touch down on this web and you take a second and you close all eight of your spider eyes and you really zone in and you dole out the rest of the world through your little ear holes and just focus on the vibrations and you let them tell a story into your very many legs.
Cyrus Schwert 01:16:52 on a loophole.
Kaladen Shash 01:16:52 Mmm. Mmm.
Dungeon Master 01:17:18 with very tiny hairs to pick up the very faintest of movement and you just almost in your head create this intricate map that follows around and kind of to some extent shapes the entire portion of the city it's like
Dungeon Master 01:17:36 Looking at it, if you were to look at a rock as a person, you see, like, lichen growing up it, very sort of, like, circular but crawling outward. You see in your mind, it almost looks like this webbing is drawing up the city underwater with time. It's not all the way to the top. It's almost there, sort of expanding slowly. And you see on certain, like, what you'd say is, like, our web highways, like...
Kaladen Shash 01:17:38 It's
Dungeon Master 01:18:03 innumerous, hundreds, thousands. It's hard to tell how many creatures you sense in total, but there is a large concentration of them moving air back from the surface out of the dome to the edge where they're sort of expanding. It's just like they're worker spiders, and you sense this other direction. Almost parallel, but not...
Dungeon Master 01:18:32 Exactly, but you do sense a tunnel not super traveled that does go towards where Kaladin had suggested you all travel.
Dungeon Master 01:18:42 But then you see the most tunnels sort of converge, like somewhere halfway in between. Almost on the level that you guys are right now, but a little bit up, you feel what senses like the very center of the high mind. And there's a very large creature there.
Dungeon Master 01:19:06 That is like perched in the center of that space. And you can tell everything converges on that space. You understand the matrix, so to speak. With that, I can end.
Cletus Cobbington 01:19:16 well I I don't know what pill I took but I found spider mommy and I found that we should probably not go that way but there is a tunnel here that's
Cyrus Schwert 01:19:17 Weird. The numbers made sense.
Leopold Magnus 01:19:29 Damn, did you take the red pill? Well, it seems almost necessary.
Kaladen Shash 01:19:42 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:19:48 Yeah, but I also found a quick tunnel to go where Kaladin was pointing at.
Cyrus Schwert 01:19:48 Isn't that the only way?
Leopold Magnus 01:19:58 Caledon, which way are you sensing?
Dungeon Master 01:19:58 It's just a fun map for visual. There are multiple ways. With Cletus driving the party and navigating you guys, it'd be super easy. They are technically stealth checks.
Dungeon Master 01:20:15 Because you can't completely avoid creatures, but you can get really close. Eventually, you almost get backed into one-way sections where you find that something is moving towards you. So you have to sort of duck back or do something last second. But everybody just give me stealth checks, and everybody can do it with advantage.
Kaladen Shash 01:20:21 So advantage plus 10, is that what it's from?
Dungeon Master 01:20:38 And we'll just add a plus 10. It's going to be almost like you have passed without a trace. So it would take a critical failure for you guys to get CMX. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:47 So, okay, cool. So I'll roll flat. Nice. You saw that.
Kaladen Shash 01:21:05 You can see
Cyrus Schwert 01:21:06 I think they're all done. I wrote the same modifier though.
Cletus Cobbington 01:21:13 How do you do the thing where you do ? Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:21:19 It's a 2D20KH, which means keep IS. And then keep IS in this one. Yeah, in your caption, you can also do that.
Leopold Magnus 01:21:27 Or you can alternate. You can just mouse over the bonus and right-click, and then roll with advantage.
Cyrus Schwert 01:21:44 I got 19. I didn't do the modifier. And so Tracer, we got 26.
Cletus Cobbington 01:21:49 I didn't modify it. I was there twice in 2007.
Dungeon Master 01:21:50 19. Nice. All really good. No fails. You guys, when you see there's just and you probably get something that you wouldn't have gotten before. All of the ones you see
Dungeon Master 01:22:20 um their eyes are clouded over like just like a faint it's like faint opaque blue instead of just like black marble um every single one of them completely based over his face um looks almost zombie-esque instead of uh free-willing and they move in very uniform fashion and
Dungeon Master 01:22:45 because eventually you sort of discern just through the movements that nothing is responding to your presence. I want to go ahead and give me a slight hand check as a spider. So it's just a dex check if it doesn't have a specific check for it. I want to see how good is your spider sense. Can you tell if a creature's looking at you from a distance?
Cletus Cobbington 01:23:03 16.
Dungeon Master 01:23:15 from the way it's laid around. At one point, the large figure at the very center of all of the webbing
Dungeon Master 01:23:37 You felt it shift, and there were heavy vibrations that followed its movement. And once it moved, it seems fixed and locked. It hasn't moved since. And that was a while ago. But I don't get more than that with that check. But yeah, you guys navigate...
Cletus Cobbington 01:23:50 Well, we want to get to that ping that Kaladin has been getting, right?
Dungeon Master 01:23:57 really cautiously you avoid everything you need to where do you guys want to go what since this is uh like game breaking in a fun way what is sort of the goal of being in here
Kaladen Shash 01:24:17 Yeah, see if we can move towards that source, or maybe within these tunnels, are there signs of other life, or do these lead between other structures within the center of the city? Right. Central hub building might eventually need access.
Cyrus Schwert 01:24:34 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:24:35 Yeah, where you are sort of right now seems like it's just like a natural tunnel. There's not like a space between. So you can't tell about other life, but you do sort of navigate your way through to where your draw was.
Dungeon Master 01:24:57 And it's where there's less spider activity. So eventually, you have to be less careful your way. But unfortunately, you find that as the pulse gets very strong, you hit the edge of a building. The tunnel kind of comes up into the mouth of a building like you've been seeing. But it's like the end of the tunnel. You can tell the water is completely surrounding you at the very edge.
Cyrus Schwert 01:25:14 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:25:22 And you feel such a strong pull and it's coming from this huge mural slash art piece that is just on this wall, like, like 50 or so feet into the water.
Cletus Cobbington 01:25:42 So what are you getting these pings from again? Like, what did you do to start getting these pings? Gotcha. Gotcha.
Kaladen Shash 01:25:45 I think just the connection. At this point, if I were to feel this, whatever this occasional pulse is, but it's become stronger and more frequent the closer we've gotten to the source.
Leopold Magnus 01:25:48 We can't see our. Have you been wearing the mask? Right.
Kaladen Shash 01:26:13 Yeah. Mask is pretty much always on. I'm just living in that thing. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
Leopold Magnus 01:26:18 And that seems to attune you more to the fey magic as well, right? Jonathan, I was going to ask back before when we were exploring the town, but maybe now I think it's even more interesting. Have I seen any graffiti or corvids? I'm looking for signs of birds.
Dungeon Master 01:26:46 No, you haven't seen anything. Good looking out. Yes, you haven't seen anything.
Leopold Magnus 01:26:49 okay just keeping my eyes peeled well there's buildings and such right like submerged although we couldn't see well
Cletus Cobbington 01:27:03 We're underwater, dude. Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:27:08 Towards the thing. Let's move towards. But now do we need to swim to this? Do we assume there's something behind the painting?
Cyrus Schwert 01:27:14 I mean, don't we still just want to walk towards Kaladin's come-buzzler?
Kaladen Shash 01:27:38 Can I, can I hold my, I can hold my breath long enough. A mural. Sorry.
Dungeon Master 01:27:38 It's not a painting. It's like a wall of carvings, picturing different things. You're looking through this mesh of silk, so it's a little distorted, but carved trees and figures, except it's much more deliberate, and you can tell it's like a...
Dungeon Master 01:28:03 like a storyboard almost, it's telling some large, grand thing that like, probably is meaningless to everybody else. But there's something about it that's really drawing you in. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:28:17 Okay. I'm going to cast Alter Self on myself again because you said it's like 50 feet underwater. Yeah, I'll do that so that I can investigate it for a while. I'm going to check out the painting. Does anybody else want to tell me?
Dungeon Master 01:28:39 Okay, you go. All right. Cletus and Cyrus, stay back. Zario, stay back too. Even though he can breathe, he just won't go. So you two kind of travel out carefully.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:46 I'll follow.
Kaladen Shash 01:28:47 You don't need to breathe. It's good.
Cyrus Schwert 01:28:48 I'll stay here for now, I guess.
Cletus Cobbington 01:28:59 Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:29:09 Like somehow squatting down and like crouch walking underneath water as you move forward. Both of you give me a perception check as you walk up. And then Leopold, you wouldn't see anything. But Kaladin, as you walk up, there is a...
Dungeon Master 01:29:30 little like carving of what looks to be like an elven child and their hand is up and their fingers are slightly curled but one finger is depicted pointing straight up and you almost swear that you see with your eyes a pulse come off of it and like vibrate through the water in front of you but leopold you don't see anything uh question
Kaladen Shash 01:29:53 off of that hand. That wasn't similar to the Colt hand. Yes. I got you. I got you. I got you. Perfect. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:30:01 No. This is like the famous Sistine Chapel carving painting. It's like the two fingers going to touch each other. It's like that kind of finger pose, but as if it were going to be pointing out towards you.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:29 Don't know if you can see the statue.
Kaladen Shash 01:30:30 Can I swim up to that section?
Dungeon Master 01:30:35 Yeah. Oh, sorry. You guys gave me checks, didn't you? I was on the wrong page.
Dungeon Master 01:30:42 Oh, 24. Leopold, you find, like Cyrus had seen earlier and probably relate to some extent, they're like, if it's totally untouched, you see like incredibly waterlogged, rolled up scrolls and parchments that like if you touch them, they would disintegrate kind of fragile. But you see, you make out underneath on like a desk that's just in this space and
Dungeon Master 01:31:11 a scroll that's got a little bit of a glimmer to it, and it looks untouched by the water. Nice. You pick that up, you put it in your bag. Kaladin, what would you like to do?
Leopold Magnus 01:31:18 interesting yeah as we're swimming by i will uh go ahead and pick that up and put up my bag
Kaladen Shash 01:31:35 As I get up to where that finger's pointing out, do I see anything else? Or is it like perfectly smooth? I feel like there's something to interact with. I think more, I think, yes, closer to where I think I saw the pulse emanating from.
Dungeon Master 01:31:48 Yeah, are you looking to check out the whole wall as an entire piece? Are you looking for something very specific on this little sculpted kid? Really, there's nothing special about it.
Cletus Cobbington 01:31:58 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:32:13 it doesn't seem cause I mean, Leopold not seeing it like informs your decision that like, this is just a wall, but there's something magical about it to you. So you're looking at it and it looks very normal. It just looks like a, something carved into the wall. Um, if you were to like, look at the whole board, you would make like, I don't know, some sort of history check to see like what the story was telling. Um, but for some reason you almost feel like you want to,
Kaladen Shash 01:32:17 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:32:31 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:32:43 you can touch that finger and like something's waiting to happen. You touch it and we'll cover what happens on the outside first, but Kaladin, go ahead and roll me a 1d4.
Kaladen Shash 01:32:50 Go ahead and touch the finger. Just curious.
Cyrus Schwert 01:33:14 Hey guys. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:33:18 everybody so half the party from behind the web and Leopold from right next to it you see Kaladin touches this thing and he just kind of falls limp underneath the water he just like sinks to the floor unconscious and Leopold you spend quite a bit of time trying to like get him to come to you're sort of pushing on his shoulder shaking him eventually you drag him
Dungeon Master 01:33:47 back into the webbing and you guys are like trying to get him to wake up and he's like under some sort of magically induced unconsciousness. Um, Calvin, you fall unconscious for one D four plus one hours. You were out cold for five hours. What happens to you as you touch this finger, you hear that same voice from that, um,
Cletus Cobbington 01:33:56 No.
Kaladen Shash 01:34:01 Five, five, five hours. I'm a lump. Yes.
Leopold Magnus 01:34:03 Jesus, dude. You're fucking sleepy.
Cyrus Schwert 01:34:06 Good morning.
Dungeon Master 01:34:15 that woman that you heard so long ago when you had first put on the mask and like had a almost lucid dream where you got to talk with her, where all you hear almost like a whisper in your ear where it says that you'd gone to Moonhaven, you would have found out who you are is what you remember hearing something about. And you touch this and that sort of resonates in your head as you go down and you see, it's like,
Cletus Cobbington 01:34:32 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:34:47 dreamish in the sense that it's like cut images and forced into your brain um like certain things that only are there for a second like you see locations and then it cuts out and it's something else you see all these things and it's very um mind-bending and weird and disorienting but you see um
Dungeon Master 01:35:08 This mural as a whole tells the story about this ancient goddess who was known to the Fae and the Fae realm as Jeya, a figure some people have heard before on the table. Jeya was a goddess of creation in the first age of the universe, like an elder god, essentially.
Cletus Cobbington 01:35:16 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:35:36 very heavily favored the fae folk and the fae realm, and everything chaotic and innately magical that just gave rise to creation. During the War of the Ascension of Heroes, when, like, the Cotton Sons were getting destroyed, Shao was the one who transplanted the last bit of, like, the human void populations into a various...
Cletus Cobbington 01:35:46 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:36:02 That was the god who was originally responsible for bringing people into the continent, who then built the domes for their protection. And Jaya supposedly placed the magic bells. So this is a story that's telling almost the start of time for you guys. And you see this depiction of this god who did this. And then it sort of makes sense because you are...
Cletus Cobbington 01:36:19 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:36:27 in the religious districts. This translates and changes the story about the two celestial trees, the tree of death and the tree of life. And you just, in your unconsciousness, gain an understanding that you didn't have before. Something that Cyrus
Dungeon Master 01:36:50 also remembered, but this is just a much greater detail. It's, like, almost live through the eyes of the people who made this. You don't know a lot of details about it right now. The Tree of Death is located in the Farndorf Fort in a place called the Ashen Grove. It is a permanently dead region of unchanging and fossilized trees. From the very tops of the canopy of this Tree of Death, which is a massive
Cletus Cobbington 01:37:17 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:37:21 a divine ash tree. It is so big that the top of the canopy goes well above the clouds. You can see this tree probably from space if you were to look.
Dungeon Master 01:37:34 you have a steady fall of ash from the sky. So you had a vision of this before, Cletus would know, but he doesn't know this is what you're seeing, of, like, it is very cold up there, so it is a mix of snow and ash at all times, giving sometimes, like, black ink dirty look on the white snow, but sometimes the untouched stuff is, like, an off-white, gray-white color. It's very dead there. You don't hear, there's almost no sound, um,
Cletus Cobbington 01:37:51 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:38:04 this mural tells of the earliest of the people from Moonhaven before travel in between was less frequent went on expeditions to investigate this tree because nobody really knew what it was but they had to stop because there was some unique property of the land that inhibits and limits healing it's less effective the closer you get to the tree there's some sort of innate magic to it
Cletus Cobbington 01:38:26 you you
Dungeon Master 01:38:34 And then while you are in this, Kaladin, go ahead and give me a religion check with advantage. Natural 20, sir.
Kaladen Shash 01:38:54 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:39:02 Man, I love that you found that. Okay. You, almost after you get images of the full mural, and in your mind, you're still right in front of it. So it's like almost out of body. You are looking at the whole thing now and yourself. You start to pick out the mural was built and then broken and changed. And then like in your head, you visualize all the pieces of art.
Dungeon Master 01:39:32 changing order and moving it tells a different story about this seer that visited the moon haven telling a prophecy um that the two trees the tree of death and the tree of life were designed to be
Cletus Cobbington 01:39:37 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:39:54 emergence point to usher in the next ruler of the Fae realm, like the king of kings of Fae lords. This seer claimed that with the absence of Jeya, who after the ascension of the heroes, all of the gods left the realm, which is why there's no direct interference anymore. Since Jeya has left, the natural
Cletus Cobbington 01:40:09 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:40:24 void of that power seat, a god of fey magic would naturally, in time, draw a new candidate, sort of as the force of nature balances itself out. And you see what is essentially a prophecy that is sort of scribed into in secret on this wall that you really only would have gotten with a natural 20.
Cletus Cobbington 01:40:39 you
Dungeon Master 01:40:50 you see this this prophecy claims that there is a the vessel of magic to reignite and reopen the fate realm would need to be uh would have to complete a ritual a huge undertaking to sort of gain a level of connection power um you with a natural 20 learn the hidden rights
Cletus Cobbington 01:41:20 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:41:20 very much been buried in detail on this wall to this ritual you know that after drinking from the waters of the wellspring at the center of the city um the equivalent of like this city's core you um must travel to the tree of death um
Dungeon Master 01:41:46 And when I say you, it's like, this is what the right is saying. And I think with Kaladin's sense of purpose, maybe would also be interpreted as you would then travel to the tree of death. And it reads very vaguely. It says, at the source of death's life, they who would be crowned Lord must give to nourish the realm, must rest to dream of stars long diminished,
Cletus Cobbington 01:42:13 you
Dungeon Master 01:42:16 and must give up their identity to be reborn in life's death with the breath of life and the twilight weave of the eternal court. And I can send that to you in text if you don't want to write that all out. And this is like what is projected into your head. And this all takes...
Kaladen Shash 01:42:33 That's great. That's great.
Cyrus Schwert 01:42:36 That would be nice.
Dungeon Master 01:42:47 hours like you didn't realize this to you this is just seconds but you were unconscious for so long as soon as that right sort of vague code i mean again this is a secret message hidden on the wall and even the secret message is vague um when you finally sort of piece together that's what it says you come to consciousness and everybody what would you like to have been doing while kaladin was unconscious it was
Cletus Cobbington 01:43:04 you you
Dungeon Master 01:43:15 at like around half one or two o'clock and he is unconscious for five hours and we'll say you were in the tunnels for 30 minutes or so so it is approximately 7 30 in the evening by the time caledon comes to so what would you guys would like to have done in that time
Kaladen Shash 01:43:16 Five hours.
Cletus Cobbington 01:43:39 Well, I'm no longer a spider. That only lasts for four hours.
Dungeon Master 01:43:49 That's okay. Once you come out of it, Zariel will go into it because he can also change into that. So you guys will have another five hours or four hours of him sort of keeping guard for you. No.
Cletus Cobbington 01:44:04 I guess also while that was happening, did I feel any thing coming towards us or any more movement from the big one?
Dungeon Master 01:44:16 Really oddly, you had noticed that it was kind of a dead space of an activity from when you first changed into it. And that doesn't change. The entire time you guys are at this essentially dead end, you can tell all of the activities happening on that super web highway that is sort of farther off from you guys going up. You are just in a spot where no spiders are going. And again, you can tell something, notice that you're here.
Cyrus Schwert 01:44:37 Hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 01:44:41 Right. Cool. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:44:45 And maybe it's just watching you from a distance, but nothing is acknowledging your presence. You almost feel like you have some respite here.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:02 I guess, would we have the time to work on stuff? And we're kind of sitting around, but it's not really, I don't know, is it a large space? Can we set up and work on some things? Oh, OK. Yeah, I was just wondering if I could work on the armor integration building.
Dungeon Master 01:45:13 You could, or you could just set up the pocket workshop and kind of go into there, because that's only the space of a large toolbox. And the space being two.
Cletus Cobbington 01:45:25 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:45:35 small to support a tiny hut-sized dome of a willow tree. You see that Zariel, who keeps it on this person, pulls out his red toolbox, opens the lid, and you see it gets a little bit bigger in size, and a ladder goes down into...
Dungeon Master 01:45:54 the dark space as this little pocket plane opens up for you guys to kind of spend the night in. You guys all climb down and you sort of divide up into your various tasks. Anything want to do anything before that?
Cletus Cobbington 01:45:55 I think so. There's nothing I've been working on or anything.
Cyrus Schwert 01:46:10 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:46:11 Before going to bed. I've got that ring of holding. I know I don't have all the money for it, but I'll keep working on the time. I mean, I woke up at 7.30. We're just hanging out now, right? We're in the workshop.
Leopold Magnus 01:46:14 Yeah, that's true.
Cletus Cobbington 01:46:28 Well, you're zonked out. Oh. That's right. Gotcha.
Dungeon Master 01:46:37 Yeah, it was what did everybody want to do in between that and then what do you guys want to do after that? So we'll do a cover in order. It seems like you guys, how long do you wait with him unconscious before you sort of decide to set up camp? No, it's 7.30.
Leopold Magnus 01:46:56 He says midnight. Oh, 730. Got it.
Dungeon Master 01:47:01 By the end. It is just after noon at the start of it, right? About two o'clock.
Cyrus Schwert 01:47:09 I wait about 45 seconds into him looking at the thing, and then I'm like, okay, well, we might as well stay here a while. It's taking forever. And I start laying out my sleeping bag. I'm tired, dude. I was a giant crab.
Kaladen Shash 01:47:13 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:47:19 Straight to bed. No, I don't think so.
Leopold Magnus 01:47:29 kind of like trying to wake Kaladin up.
Dungeon Master 01:47:29 And then you guys go into camp mode. Okay. Yeah. At that point, you guys would have like a half day rest to work on various stuff. Leopold's going to work on his armor a bit. Anybody else want to do anything?
Cyrus Schwert 01:47:50 Nope.
Dungeon Master 01:47:59 OK? Leopold, how much time are you putting into your armor? Yeah, if you guys give up right away, which is super funny, you have a full 12 hours of free time.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:09 Uh, let's see. It's like you said, did you end up saying it was about two o'clock, 2 PM? Okay. Um, well, I think I want to need to sleep for sick. Um, cause I have like a centuries rest thing. So I'll put, uh, I'll put the other six hours into it, I guess.
Cletus Cobbington 01:48:17 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:48:23 So long. I play Pinochle.
Dungeon Master 01:48:40 All right. And this is, what are you doing? You're working on the Dragonhide, right?
Leopold Magnus 01:48:49 Yeah, so I'm trying to integrate that dragon hide into Bone Crusher's armor. Kind of fortify him a little bit more. That's a black dragon. Yeah. I think that... I don't remember the DC, but last time...
Kaladen Shash 01:48:55 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:48:58 And this was, it's the second thing you put on him. So I made it harder. So this was, I had like basically just, what is the DC when it's up? There's a, it's supposed to be, it was supposed to be a DC. Oh, it's a DC 22. That's what it was.
Dungeon Master 01:49:21 and you made half your check. So if you're putting another six hours in, I think I wrote down where you were at at some point. I don't remember now. Ooh, you have 26 hours left. I wrote it down.
Leopold Magnus 01:49:21 Okay. Okay, cool.
Cletus Cobbington 01:49:22 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:49:28 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:49:46 So you're at 20 hours. We'll make in that time, because then 20 can go down divisibly pretty easy. Just give me one DC 22. Check. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:49:48 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:49:59 Okay, and that's Arcana, right? Oh, fuck me. I think that's exactly what happened last time. I rolled like a 2 or a 3. Just crazy. Alright.
Kaladen Shash 01:50:05 Mm hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:50:14 Time goes into it. Still a chance to it. It's not exactly going how you'd like. You're having a hard time getting Bone Crusher, which is a flavored version of your little buddy that you technically get. So you're trying to turn this very basic...
Cletus Cobbington 01:50:20 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:50:32 automaton design and make it integrate this organic matter which is really hard but then with like the sort of self evolving thing that has sort of been going through where it's improving itself as well you are starting to make headway you're figuring things out what would everybody else like to do
Leopold Magnus 01:50:53 Keep chipping away.
Kaladen Shash 01:51:07 In the evening, I'll spend a few hours. I only need four hours of meditation. So I'll spend as many hours as I can just putting more time into that ring of spell storage or whatever.
Dungeon Master 01:51:15 Yeah, you could... If everybody gets up at like... I don't know, in my head, adventurers get up at like 5 or 6. You wake up at 7.30. You have...
Cletus Cobbington 01:51:15 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:51:37 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:51:42 you know, four and a half hours, and then five hours, nine hours, you take four off that, you have five hours, five-ish hours that you could dedicate to enchanting. Or we could just call it an even six like Leopold put in. Yours is an easier thing. I think you have...
Kaladen Shash 01:51:52 That's perfect. Let's do this. Great.
Dungeon Master 01:52:10 You've passed all of your checks. So you're just doing time at this point, right? Oh, yeah. But it was just 32 hours, I'm pretty sure.
Cletus Cobbington 01:52:16 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:52:19 No, no, no, not on this one. This is something I just restarted. I think I've only rolled once on it. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:52:35 You've rolled two checks, so we'll do one more because it's only a DC 14 because you've been crushing it. Give me six more hours. I don't know. Have you been checking where you are right now? It'll be somewhere. I think you did half of it, so 32 was reduced to 16. No, 18.
Cletus Cobbington 01:52:56 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:53:03 So maybe down to 10 if this is a good roll. Down to 12.
Dungeon Master 01:53:08 Yeah. 18. Nice. That is a success. Go down to 12 hours. One more super long session or two more regular ones like this, and you'll probably have your ring completed.
Cletus Cobbington 01:53:32 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:53:36 Well,
Dungeon Master 01:53:43 Alrighty. And as you guys bed down for the night, unless anybody has anything they want to do specifically, at some point, as you guys will probably, as you're going to bed and all bedding down, Kaladin probably relays or maybe doesn't what he saw. The pathetic dream he had
Kaladen Shash 01:54:05 Share all of it. Dream. I did not expect that to happen.
Cyrus Schwert 01:54:15 well thank you for sharing Caledon that was just an honest of you it's really vulnerable he has Hashimoto's
Cletus Cobbington 01:54:16 it just looks like you got like real sleepy and just fell asleep real quick we thought you just got bored of that the scripture real quick or something
Dungeon Master 01:54:18 And you guys. This is a real hyped up. I thought you had like a thyroid problem, honestly.
Kaladen Shash 01:54:42 The little thing is getting dangerous.
Leopold Magnus 01:54:49 Oh, yes, we were very concerned about Galadin, but I did get some work done on Bone Crusher here.
Dungeon Master 01:54:58 he's got like portions of his armor have been cut out and some of them are filled in but he's got some gaps of like where he is like weld slash stitching in black dragon hide and then yeah you guys complete your long rest nothing crazy happens on this night at the start of the day Kaladin give me a wisdom saving throw
Cletus Cobbington 01:55:22 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:55:28 So I can level up. Those are always so low. 11. Better than average. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:55:32 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:55:43 Yeah. Yeah, nothing happens. Yeah. Nothing happens. That's it. Yeah, I wish I could give you more on that because...
Cletus Cobbington 01:55:58 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:56:13 Obviously something's happening, but you don't notice anything. That is the third time. As you guys get ready for your day, how about it'll be Cyrus. Cyrus, you get
Kaladen Shash 01:56:14 I know. Yes. It's like the third time I've gotten to try to roll for that.
Dungeon Master 01:56:45 a message in your head. And it's from sort of a, a hushed voice. You hear a little bit of panic in it, but, um, it's not like urgency. It's just like general anxiety probably at this point, but the voice, uh, is a familiar in the brief amount of time that you had met them. Um, you hear the, uh,
Cyrus Schwert 01:56:49 Oh.
Cletus Cobbington 01:57:09 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:57:13 the voice of who you later learn to be named Ratshit, kind of quietly pipes in and goes, Is this, um, is this, I mean, I know that it definitely is Potom, that fellow that I sent through the teleporter.
Dungeon Master 01:57:34 and quiet and you can tell this is the scrying spell so you have 20 words per every message but before you get off another message it keeps going as if you use two in succession um this figure goes right well to it i and then he gets a little bit more concise hit a dagger in your cloak to track you next thing he says is i've um i overheard before things went to hell
Cletus Cobbington 01:57:49 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:57:57 Won't.
Dungeon Master 01:58:02 entirely to hell um they're watching you and then quiet and he gets a little bit more panicked and he goes i've been holding out for them they're on to me tell them and as soon as he hits 20 he sends out another one um tell the odiers abandon the mission if they won't they need to come back and then you have a chance to respond
Kaladen Shash 01:58:06 you
Cletus Cobbington 01:58:33 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:58:36 are the first words that I'm going to say the response or do I get to choose? Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. I'm going to do that.
Dungeon Master 01:58:43 You get to choose when you're starting to respond out of game. But it is as soon as you start talking, your word count goes. So you guys can talk about it because you have a mental link. So you could basically not say anything while you side chat it.
Cyrus Schwert 01:59:05 telepathy talking I say I just got a message from Ratchet he's scrying on us or something he's in danger he said to abandon the mission if we want to because it is going to shit yeah
Leopold Magnus 01:59:22 Oh, Donnie and his soft tissues. After his accident, he just wasn't the same, to be honest. Well, now, hold on. You know, I wouldn't call him a piece of shit. He is a good friend of ours. But, boy, abandoning a mission? That sounds ridiculous.
Kaladen Shash 01:59:26 Let's
Cyrus Schwert 01:59:31 Yeah, he was a real piece of shit. I felt it in the short time that I knew him. He sounded really distressed.
Cletus Cobbington 01:59:34 He did just kind of shove us in a portal and shift us out outside the bubble, so...
Kaladen Shash 01:59:57 Perhaps we should better understand what is happening at the Dome and why we should return.
Cyrus Schwert 02:00:06 okay I start saying out loud uh what if you could hear me what's going on in the dome um oh sure
Cletus Cobbington 02:00:09 That was the... giggle.
Dungeon Master 02:00:31 You have like 60 words because he sent three in a row. After a while. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:00:36 Are we in danger? Does this depend on us? Are we the only ones left? Are these puppies vital to the mission? I'm sure I have more words than that. Is there anything else you want me to ask? In particular? Callie and Leopold? Daryl?
Cletus Cobbington 02:00:41 How's my farm doing?
Kaladen Shash 02:00:52 That's my power. We got that one in.
Cyrus Schwert 02:01:06 for your mission is oh dear that was included so basically the questions were are you in danger are we vital to the safety of the dome generally what's going on those are like the three questions that have been I'd say
Leopold Magnus 02:01:10 Yeah, ask him the situation at the dome. Like, is he in danger?
Cletus Cobbington 02:01:19 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:01:28 Yep.
Dungeon Master 02:01:32 after a little bit you hear another message he goes this will wipe me out you get that in too this will wipe me out magically I don't have enough reserve to keep going but I'll answer all of them after you left Lord Marshall went nuts chaos for a week or two
Cyrus Schwert 02:01:40 I'm saying this out loud as you play with me.
Cletus Cobbington 02:01:52 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:02:03 settle down and it's very choppy in the way he responds and he goes legionnaire went weird in response martial law declared nobody heard from first council lord of advancement took control claiming second power another break
Cyrus Schwert 02:02:21 Oh,
Cletus Cobbington 02:02:23 you you
Dungeon Master 02:02:34 There is dangerous army of warforged patrolling streets as new soldiers.
Dungeon Master 02:02:46 All legionnaires are considered friendly, but it felt wrong, so I've been spying. Think they're on to me, so I just ran. I took all the scrying squirrels I had on top of this. We'll get in touch later when I have my own arcana back.
Cletus Cobbington 02:02:56 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:03:06 And then you get this is sort of the end of it. He goes, in the last message, not that I know you guys could fix it, but you were good folk and probably the strongest people that I know for sure are not in on it as I was there when you were recruited. What are puppies?
Cletus Cobbington 02:03:28 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 02:03:34 Okay. I have relayed that all out loud as I was hearing it. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:03:43 Cool. Then recapping it, not in my attempted Irish, obviously. The turn of events was you took the Lord Marshal's kin of some kind. He freaked out, sieged the city. The Legionnaire's response was weird.
Kaladen Shash 02:03:43 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:04:03 the highest-ranking official in the city disappeared. Nobody knows what happened publicly. And even Ratchet, who was a captain in the Legionnaire, the Lord of Advancement seized the power gap in absence and his first initiative unleashed his new design at an army of Warforged soldiers that are part of the Legionnaire, but they're like...
Cletus Cobbington 02:04:11 you you
Kaladen Shash 02:04:23 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:04:33 you know, not to be redundant with terms or overuse it, but like Nazi Germany kind of deal. It's like regimes walking down the street, people cowering kind of deal. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:04:41 I can see it.
Cyrus Schwert 02:04:49 That sounds fucking insane. Maybe we should just stay here. Live with the spiders. I could be a crab. I could see it. We spend the next 82 years in this spider tunnel.
Leopold Magnus 02:04:49 It's a military coup, effectively. You know, I wouldn't mind. I could set up the workshop, puzzle away on Bone Crusher here.
Kaladen Shash 02:05:01 yes i'm not
Cletus Cobbington 02:05:12 This is us now. Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:05:19 You guys grew old together. Eventually... Who would date who was the next question. Just kidding. Eventually...
Leopold Magnus 02:05:20 That's the campaign. Wrap it up.
Cyrus Schwert 02:05:21 What happens now? Yeah. I think the death tree sounds more safe than that from being honest.
Kaladen Shash 02:05:31 Yeah, the dome sounds, Nunu Harbor sounds pretty bad right now. It's a bad show. Yes. I think perhaps we continue our quest. I understand this is a concern, but we will make our way back to make it over here. Very nice.
Cletus Cobbington 02:05:59 you you
Cyrus Schwert 02:06:04 at least we got some information from it.
Dungeon Master 02:06:06 friend, your character is so good that I don't know that I understood what you meant. I said, your character and voice is so good that I don't think I understood what he said.
Kaladen Shash 02:06:14 What's that? Could you not hear me? Oh, it must have been muffled. I was just talking. What did I say? I said we need... Oh, we just said we should thank Richard for the information. We just let him go. We just let him right out the door. Hey, come join us.
Dungeon Master 02:06:34 Something about following this web or something. And I was like, huh? Yeah. Sure. You know it.
Kaladen Shash 02:06:46 Just ramble on. Use all 25 words very quickly.
Cletus Cobbington 02:06:56 You understand exactly what he's talking about, right? Say it one more time, but even more accented, Kaladin. More power.
Dungeon Master 02:07:06 Yes, completing the mission, letting Ratchet come to him. Just took me a little bit.
Cyrus Schwert 02:07:20 More.
Kaladen Shash 02:07:22 pretend to...
Cletus Cobbington 02:07:26 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:07:28 But yeah, we'll end it there for the night. I wanted to leave it off with like the last thing you guys get is an update from the dome. So it's still we'll pick up early morning hours, you know, five or six in the morning. Post prophetic dream. You have this enclosed room in water that had this mural or you have the tunnel leading back.
Dungeon Master 02:07:56 There is that looming spider figure-ish creature that Cleet has picked up on at the center of the webs. And then there is heavy concentration of spiders, but there does seem to be like a very large tunnel system that leads towards the surface. So these are a couple of things you can try for next session. But yeah, we'll wrap up our 29th session right there.
Cletus Cobbington 02:08:07 Hmm. Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 02:08:25 Nice.
Cyrus Schwert 02:08:26 Very nice.
Dungeon Master 02:08:30 Yeah. You guys were talking about it earlier, but it is very cool that we have something so consistent. I do love that. Try to keep it like three to three and a half.
Leopold Magnus 02:08:34 That's crazy. That's a lot of hours. Yeah. I mean, we normally play for like three and a half, four hours, give or take. So like, yeah, you know, 30 sessions later.
Cletus Cobbington 02:08:42 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:08:57 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:09:08 crazy. Thanks for the sesh, Johnny. Say what?
Dungeon Master 02:09:08 Very cool. I like where you guys are at. That's pretty cool.
Leopold Magnus 02:09:14 That's essentially 13 eight-hour days of playing D&D. We worked for like two weeks straight, and we just played D&D eight hours a day. That's how long it would take us to get here. Well, that's fun. Yeah. As always, thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:09:19 Nice and light.
Kaladen Shash 02:09:39 Yeah, appreciate it. Yeah, Thursday's good.
Dungeon Master 02:09:39 Thanks, guys. We're just good for next week, same time? Oh, no, 7.30. I had a lot of big chart notes today. I had some weird cases, and it just took a lot to type. So that worked pretty well. Luckily, I work a half day tomorrow. So that's nice.
Leopold Magnus 02:09:46 Yeah. That's fucking great for a Friday.
Cyrus Schwert 02:09:48 That's good.
Cletus Cobbington 02:09:50 Same time as in the usual time or 8 o'clock? Hell yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:10:09 anyway yeah it's great um to talk about it without breaking anything uh got this really cool patient case right now um he's got what's called pran's position of the great vessels which means like basically the plumbing to his heart was backwards inferior vena cava and like his aorta like everything is it was on wrong so as a baby they like went in and

Speakers 00:00:07 Well then, are we ready to start? Does it need a moment? Yeah, I'm ready to go. Yeah, ready. Ready, all ready. I'll do a brief recap because it touches on most of it. But the session started in that three-day gap that you guys had where you were making your preparations, moving, getting all that settled.
Speakers 00:00:34 in which you went and met the smithy hamhawk a large like ogre heritage woman who very intelligent a great artificer smithy mechanics could seemingly seemingly do it all you uh picked up your gear met uh a certain guard of the legion named ratchet who sort of helped you get acquainted figure out where everything was
Speakers 00:01:00 During this process of moving in, we had a great natural 20 from Zariel to sort of peek through like a meeting room window and see just a lot of information about high status cases, you know, lower ones and like the value people have gone missing, like all these weird things that you don't really get to see on a day to day, especially as like the newbies.
Speakers 00:01:29 And then after that, you guys got assigned your first case to just, you know, suss out some missing people and like reported monster cases of the Storm District, somewhere on the southeastern side of it all. Through your investigation, you met some real hard-headed, absent-minded, very unhelpful figures. The first one being an incredibly old woman named Selina.
Speakers 00:01:58 uh that was s-a-y-l-e-e-n-a uh just just a real character is how i would love to describe her her and her awakened familiar marcelle the the little hermit crab uh that i don't know why you've been to her how it got as far as it did but leopold almost went on a date with which was spectacular uh but
Speakers 00:02:25 Defeated at that interaction, you guys left looking for other sources of information. You ran into a... Man, how do I describe him? A short, thick, sparse bearded... He had like wolf furry type of scarf and plastic vampire teeth in. He talked like this.
Speakers 00:02:56 We never asked his name, because I'm sure you didn't really want it. And I wrote it down somewhere, but it doesn't really matter because I don't care about him that much. But he also didn't know anything, but he seemed to be really into you guys as a group. Particularly Leopold and his large size.
Speakers 00:03:14 You also spoke with the bouncer of the bar who basically reiterated the information that you were sort of hesitant on, like the exact location, sort of was like, oh, no, it actually was where you were checking out. And through this discussion and a battle of the dice, you heard screams and saw a figure being drug into Selena's shop.
Speakers 00:03:38 through the main floor into the back room, down a secret tunnel that dropped you into this sort of forgotten Myconid tunnel system. You took a second, gathered yourselves and then started making your way down. Not making it terribly far before you had your first encounter with a small Myconid quadrupedal creature. You handedly dealt with it.
Speakers 00:04:03 uh but in the process it had a chance to alert all of the other ones near it in the immediate vicinity and you had a little more intense of a fight that sort of drug out to the end of the session uh we ended with you guys beginning to take your short rest so we pick up sort of in the moment you've just finished off this last creature with a very i think it was also a natural 20
Speakers 00:04:29 from Kaladin, a firebolt that just landed and incinerated it from the inside out. You have a second. You don't hear any other immediate threats. What would you guys like to do? Can I just listen a little bit more while I'm still in my wild shape form?
Speakers 00:05:00 You're a wild-shaped giraffe, if I recall correctly, because you took a pretty gnarly hit. Oh, oh, you're right. You're right. Uh, never mind. I'll just, uh... I'll just chill then. Yeah, I'm fine just going for a short rest.
Speakers 00:05:22 OK. Somebody go ahead and just give me a luck check to see if something happens while you're trying to take this 30 minutes to an hour to rest. I'll roll that. We might see something.
Speakers 00:05:51 Who's got the highest passive perception? I don't think I do. 10. That's 14. Sorry, I accidentally closed mine. I couldn't get my sheet to pop up, so I don't have my stats on right now. One second. I did have one question. Wizards, do you regain a spell slot with a short rest? Arcane Recovery, yeah.
Speakers 00:06:20 and recovery yet? Yes. I absolutely didn't use this. My passive perception is 15. Well, don't take your short rest yet because you guys don't know if you get it. Sorry, I'll go ahead and make a active perception check as you feel like you sort of hear something in the distance. Right. Sounds good.
Speakers 00:06:51 Hmm. Sounds like a cave. Oh, really, Sariel? Quite, quite inquisitive of you. Well, you know, not all my remarks are going to be clever and witty. We'll see how it goes. But I definitely don't hear anything at all.
Speakers 00:07:15 Excellent. I'm pretty tired. I could go for a little bit of a break. So Jonathan, are you saying take it like actively click the button to take it or you guys as the half hour to an hour sort of that sort of gray area where you're sort of licking your wounds, cleaning your weapon, sort of resetting you guys make it the full span without something happening.
Speakers 00:07:46 Interesting. Alright. Oh, man. Well, that felt good. I'm surprised. I've never seen anything like these mushroom folk before. I kind of feel bad for arcing them, but they were trying to kill us, so probably it was for the best.
Speakers 00:08:16 Jonathan could I do a nature check to take a look at this mycelium and maybe into it some weaknesses Maybe there's a Head head dude who controls them all something like that Yeah, go ahead and give me a check 10 and You
Speakers 00:08:42 I think just inherently it's common knowledge that fungus works through a shared system generally but I don't know that you personally have the information in your head of like they probably are connected by a hive mind like that's not a thought that you can logically draw maybe you as the player decide that that's what he thinks but I won't reinforce that
Speakers 00:09:05 is like fact or you know myth or anything like that just because you're not totally certain so that's more i'm going to leave that up to you if you want to run with that information form plots off of it but a 10 is not going to give you that definitive you um do sort of looking at this and sort of observing the environment where you guys are it seems pretty sparse it's not like
Speakers 00:09:29 a thick tunnel of just mycelium and you know meat of mushroom on the ground or anything like that like at this point it's mostly dirt and stone with like mushrooms popping out here and there a little bit of like bioluminescence barely visible but you still have enough of like your torch like that it's not overwhelming like it seems just like an overrun tunnel at this point
Speakers 00:10:00 Yeah, I'll kind of bend down and pluck one of the mushrooms and hold it in my hand and turn to the group and I'll say, why I think some of these mushrooms might be interrelated to each other. When we killed that little one, this big bumbling oaf stumbled over. So I think it likely that there's maybe a one in charge. We should maybe, maybe should look for that.
Speakers 00:10:31 Right. Well, maybe that was it. Maybe we killed it. And I'll kind of kick it a little bit. I'll say, this thing? I don't think so. There's probably at least a few more where he came from. Well. What do you say, Kaladin? You want to...
Speakers 00:10:58 Keep moseying on down this here tunnel. Perhaps run into a few more mushrooms. Yes, we need to know more. How many people above the table was it? 10 people are missing? I believe it was like 6. 6 missing? Right, yeah. I think that they knew it was missing and one legionnaire went missing on the case beforehand.
Speakers 00:11:28 Oh, I forgot about that. We need to find some bodies. That's a good point. We were told to bring back proof. Why don't we collect a specimen here? I'll just reach down and I'll take a part of the smaller mushroom that's got like a bit of a face and maybe like that looks like you can tell that it's intelligent somehow and capable of harm and I'll just rip it off and put it in my bag.
Speakers 00:11:59 Okay, add one decaying mushroom add to your bag. Right. We're having cream of mushroom tonight. You guys know when you like take mushroom out of the fridge, then put it back in and it's like real soggy and wet? Mm. Yeah. Oh, Zario, that's gonna quite make us stink later. You don't intend to bring that back to the bunkhouse, do you? We'll.
Speakers 00:12:30 We'll see, it's probably evidencia. Probably has to go somewhere specific. Ugh, all this adventuring is so filthy. I suppose we should have some proof. Yeah, I imagine we won't have to keep it for long. I've never added something to inventory that wasn't like an actual thing. How do you do that? Oh.
Speakers 00:12:58 In your backpack or whatever there's gonna be like a manage inventory button and in there you can say add custom And just type in what it is Coming from a guy who collects a lot of interesting things It's a must-have I still not seeing it. That's okay. I don't need to
Speakers 00:13:26 Pull things up, it's okay. Oh, there it is, found it. Found it, yeah. Perfect, okay. Bam. All right, continue. This is on you guys. You finished your long rest, you've got three pathways that you can't see the end of. You've collected the mushroom head, what is your next step?
Speakers 00:13:54 Jonathan, can I make an investigation check if there's maybe, you know, if these are mushrooms that are somehow connected, is there like a vein growing down a cave wall or some sign of mushrooms intensifying in a certain direction one way or another? Yeah, how far are you going to go down each tunnel to sort of suss it out? I guess would that be...
Speakers 00:14:23 I'll go like 10 or 15 feet and just kind of looking up the down, the sidewalls, you know, just trying to stay fairly close to the group. Not really, not hoping to pass through the point where it's blacked out and I can't really see. You can make either three independent investigation checks for the free tunnels or one perception check. And if the perception check is good, it would count for all of them.
Speakers 00:14:52 I'll do three independent ones, starting with this mid-tunnel that we're closest to. All right, that'll take him a little stuck in. What do you guys want to do in the meantime? I'll turn to Kaladin. While Leo is going down this main tunnel, I'll say, whale, what do you think? Should we split up, each take a tunnel? No, that's a terrible idea.
Speakers 00:15:21 This is madness. Variel, we will stick together. That's smart. You see, I'm used to working by myself in the core. A lot of tunnels, you know. I'm not the best in groups, but I can try. Do you want to go with me and check out one of these? Or should we stick with Leo down here? Let us wait with Leo. Let him check.
Speakers 00:15:50 Can I assist with his investigation? Yes, yes you can. I'm just going to follow. Oh, go ahead, sorry. Oh, I'm just telling him that he can go ahead. OK, yeah, I wanted to follow with the torch and see what I could see and see if I can make a perception check. Go ahead and make that perception. Not 20. No, not 20. That's the first tunnel. Yeah, for this middle one here.
Speakers 00:16:20 Damn. Yeah, this one. I got you. OK, go ahead and make the other two. OK. All with advantage. Yeah, with advantage, right? Yeah. You've got Kaladin at your side. That's good there. 26, 14. 15. You know what's the second one for the one on the right or the one on the left? I think I had said the one on the right. OK.
Speakers 00:16:49 Uh, Natural 20. First and foremost, Leopold is sort of casing it. You're like arcane eyes beneath the mask flare, and it sort of sends out a scan, and you for sure can say that this tunnel down here doesn't seem to have any more mica nids is the first thing, but also you can tell, even if you don't go all the way down, that it seemingly connects to the tunnel on the left.
Speakers 00:17:18 They sort of meet in a common area, but you just haven't been down there yet. The tunnel on the right, you're only getting about 5 feet into it, you said? Yeah, like 10 or so. Just kind of a little bit beyond where we were standing. 15's still pretty good. You can see that down the hall it seems to break into two directions again.
Speakers 00:17:39 And that's what those checks say. So, the tunnel on the left, the tunnel on the right, you're not sure if they're clear of danger. You did see a mushroom creature fall out of the wall when you first got here. But this middle tunnel, at least, you are, one, certain it's clear. Two, it doesn't seem like it gets deeper because it looks like it just connects to the tunnel on the left. And then, um... So that would leave, like, either this room that they share at the end go somewhere, or the tunnel on the right go somewhere.
Speakers 00:18:09 Okay. And a 24 perception check. And what are you checking out, Zario? Anything in particular or just scanning?
Speakers 00:18:25 Uh, I just want to kind of look around for disturbances. You know, we just heard a man dragged through here and we haven't really checked the floor to see like scraping fingers or I just want to scan these three directions to see if there's any that's more disturbed than any other.
Speakers 00:18:44 Yeah, you see the drag marks are going towards the right and like there's like those slight disturbances is like the dirt is pushed into like a half circle like a almost a dome but concave into the ground is something is like pushing and stepping backwards like something is dragging something else. You've got the fingerprints and the little like Mike in it footprints that go down that way.
Speakers 00:19:16 Well boys, it looks like our unfortunate friend is down this way. I'd vote we see if we can't do something about saving him, but what do you guys think? There's another tunnel too. We'll just follow the leads.
Speakers 00:19:39 Well, I don't know about either direction, to be honest with you. They all seem to go somewhere that I don't want to be, but I will follow you. Zariel, you're quite the mate. All right, well, let's head on down. Who do we want to have, like, be in the front? Who's the beefiest?
Speakers 00:20:04 I'm currently the healthiest. Did you not roll any hit dice on your short rest? Yes, you already did your character. Ooh, I did not. Let me do that real fast. You're the beefiest, but only by a little. What's your armor class? 13? 13, yeah. I think I have the highest AC with 20, but I don't have very much hit points. Leopold's got 20 AC, so he's the hardest to hit, at least.
Speakers 00:20:34 What? He's got 20 AC? He's wearing armor. He's a walking armor. Yeah, and I've got the half plate armor. That's crazy. Alright, I'm rolling 2d8 plus 3. That's 7 plus 6, 11. I'll add that on real quick. Oh yeah, the other thing, Warforged gets a plus 1 to AC.
Speakers 00:21:01 Sorry, I'm back up to 23. You don't think about it, but squishy character and just like a Warforged body is pretty smart. Yeah. Damn. Well, I suppose we can head this way. I'll just start walking, I guess. Because Leo's doesn't seem to be
Speakers 00:21:30 Most steadfast, even though he is the hardest to hit. We'll just head on down this way, I guess. Alrighty, when you get to the bend, do you take a left or a right? Can I look again to see if there's any one that looks to be more disturbed than the other?
Speakers 00:21:52 Easy enough. You look to your left and this looks like a torch, but I just put that there to signal that that's like a natural source of light. You see like a convergence of bioluminescence of like veins in the wall. So this is just a well that end is what those yellow lights are. But you don't see anything down there. Interesting.
Speakers 00:22:23 I'd like to try to stealth if I can. Yeah, everybody go ahead and roll a stealth check if you all want to join. I'll try. Looks like an 8. Not stealthy.
Speakers 00:22:51 Look at that, the guy wearing plate armor is the sneakiest. Well, I had disadvantage, so it's a 10. Oh, so it's the 8, okay. Plus 2, so 10. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, because what you had missed on your short rest was behind Leopold, a little mushroom creature peels itself off the wall, waiting for you in wait.
Speakers 00:23:19 Unfortunately, even with advantage, it tinks off the back of Leopold's chestplate as it goes to, like, bring him down to the ground. We'll just work in loose initiative here. Leopold, you're going to be the next up to act. And then it'll be Kaladin and Zariel, but Kaladin and Zariel, you were under, like, a surprise round because you didn't see it there and it didn't attack you. So this first round will just be the two, and then you'll join it afterwards.
Speakers 00:23:48 Okay, so Leopold, what would you like to do? It's this little mushroom monster sort of like crawls out of the wall and claws at the back of your greaves. So it's just, it's trying to attack me? Yep, it fully tried to attack you, but I rolled an 18 and a 10, but 18 plus one still doesn't hit. I see, I see. Yeah, I think I'm gonna, well, so first of all, can we change cantrips on short rest or is that only during the long rest?
Speakers 00:24:15 No, and depending on your class, you might not be able to change cantrips until you level up. So you should, that should be, we should clarify that. Okay. Where, where would I, where would I see that? It's like a, like very first level kind of information, maybe even like the artifice or like main page. Featured traits. It would be an area where you'd probably see. So I gotta go to my, I gotta go to the character sheet. And I'll just look it up while you do that. Um,
Speakers 00:24:45 But while you do this, you're going to try to hit it, obviously, right? Or something like that? Yeah. Go ahead. You'll have disadvantage with your crossbow, so you can do an unarmed strike, or if you've got something else you can use. If I could have changed my cantrips, I would have switched my mending spell out. I was going to put in a firebolt, but... I'm pulling up their page right now.
Speakers 00:25:17 I know I have these infusions, and I think I can change those, but... When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the Artificer cantrips you know with another one from the Artificer spawn list, but you cannot change out any of them. Okay, alright, so then it's Mending, not Firebolt. Okay, so I'm going to use an action to cast Magic Stone.
Speakers 00:25:47 Well, I guess that would be also disadvantaged because of the distance. Yeah, okay, I'll cast Magic Stone with my action and then I will throw one of the Magic Stones at this creature. You could always move and then throw. It's not like it's going to be able to hit you.
Speakers 00:26:14 Yeah, that's true, it's probably a low chance. Okay, I will back up down this tunnel, so that way I still have line of sight to the creature, but I'm a little bit out of reach. And take an attack of opportunity. Okay, it'll roll at ya. Doesn't get advantage this time. Rolls a 13. Tinks off your armor. Nice, okay. And then with the magic stone, I will use my bonus action to hurl the magic stone at it.
Speakers 00:26:44 Do it up. 17 to hit. Absolutely. This little sprout doesn't have a whole lot to him. 5 damage on that magic stone. The magic stone takes out like 75% of its body, but you see that it doesn't take out all of the vital organs and mass to it. And it's sort of like crawls and it's still coming after you pretty fiercely, but it is very hurt.
Speakers 00:27:15 Okay, that is my turn. It'll be its turn. Gonna just... I think it only has 10 feet of movement. Gonna get right there. Gonna dash and close the distance. And that is its turn. Back up to the top, we'll do Leopold. Oh, back to me. Okay.
Speakers 00:27:41 Yeah, Kaladin and Zariel were too far ahead, and they both missed it, so they were sort of surprised by it. Since you were attacked, you could have acted too, because it broke your surprise. Got it. Okay, I will... I will again run away. I'm gonna kind of jump over this thing, and you'll hear me go, Oh, Zariel!
Speakers 00:28:09 This thing is coming after me. Okay, I'm just kind of like my arms are just kind of flailing in the back. You know, I'm just kind of like clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink. All my armors clinking together. You guys are watching a show right now.
Speakers 00:28:29 And then I think that I for you know Canon purposes I feel like these magic stones are just like the armors automatic like self-defense Century type thing so I'm running in the stone kind of like focuses in on the creature and fires off Go ahead and roll Ten to hit
Speakers 00:28:58 Ten exactly hits. Oh wow, okay. Eight damage with that one. Go ahead and finish off this Mike and it's sprout. Okay, yeah, so Leopold is kind of running away, arms in tow. There's two magic stones kind of circulating above his head. This is kind of the automated sentry portion of the armor and it
Speakers 00:29:24 zeros in on the Myconid, and just with a flash of sound and light, you just see a puff of a little rock explode, and this Myconid ceases to exist. The magic stones float magically around the armor, and then flashes of runes, and you see like a little bead draws directly to it, and then the stone falls quickly in tow, knocking it out. Well, not knock it out. Blowing through its mushroom cap, and it just falls lifeless to the ground.
Speakers 00:29:53 Leopold hits the cave wall, bounces off, lands on his back, looking straight up at the top of the cavern. Some wily coyote action. You guys are out of initiative. Damn. Whoa.
Speakers 00:30:18 What happened? What happened? What happened? Why am I in the... How should I dust myself off a little bit? What is that thing? Well, Leo, seems like you're a little more, uh, more apt to this sort of thing than you might even think. You just single-handedly took out this little squirt here. I'll just kind of kick it a little bit with my, with my boot.
Speakers 00:30:46 Well, to be honest, I did no such thing. I don't know. I think the armor has some integrated capacities. If I might say, I'm very curious to take a look once we get back to camp. Can I do an investigation check on the walls or just this what appears to be a dead end, because this is where we thought the trail was, the dragging area.
Speakers 00:31:16 Yeah, you can check. There we go. 24. Nice. 19. This just seems like a dead end. Doesn't seem like there's any sort of false walls, secret tunnels, there's no hidden bodies. This is just like, you took a left when you should have taken a right kind of deal. And that's just like you said, just bioluminescent.
Speakers 00:31:42 That doesn't appear to be anything else. I'm above board telling the party that I put in periodically areas of intense light. Okay. So that if you didn't have torches, there'd be areas giving off light. I gotcha. Cool. We should keep moving. Yeah, let's head on down this way.
Speakers 00:32:09 You're telling me, these things are the ones coming after me. Skittishly follow. Left or right? How far can I see with my torchlight? I've got 60 feet of dark vision. You have a good shot down the tunnel. Well, here, yeah, I move out of the way. Let him take a peek.
Speakers 00:32:35 Can I, again, can I take a look around at the floor, pick up a little bit of dirt through my hands and see if I can sense a direction here, any sort of disturbances? Go for it. 15. That'll be about the edges of your vision, of the dark vision. 15, no new information. It seems like in this spot, there's not like as soft of dirt.
Speakers 00:33:05 path with the 15. You know you took the right tunnel to get here but you just don't know where to go going forward. So as a player having a full view of the map I can kind of guess that this is going to link back up over here
Speakers 00:33:26 And it wouldn't make any sense for the creature to drag past. As a player, I don't know that my intelligence is high enough to be able to represent this schematic abstractly in my head. Can I roll an intelligence check to see if I put that together? Yeah, as a DM, you might be wrong. You should also just consider that. Oh. Oh. Oh.
Speakers 00:33:52 Can I roll to think I'm right? You can absolutely make a check, but I'm letting you know that your logic may be incorrect there. So I got a dirty 20. Dirty 20. Zario, following Jesse's
Speakers 00:34:15 logical it does occur that the tunnel on the right might lead back up to the beginning and it is more likely that the tunnel to the left goes to undiscovered pathways how about that is that satisfied and in an ambiguous way i like it you guys i think i there's this voice in my head a very intelligent voice it's telling me
Speakers 00:34:44 that I think we should go left. Well, sometimes, Zario, the voice in your head is always right. Quite honestly, I can't get the one in my head to shut up. Kaladin, give me a charisma saving throw. Oh, no. Oh, great. Sorry. I'm going to pull my character. Charisma saving throw.
Speakers 00:35:14 Yes, it's just going to be a straight up. Oh, OK, OK, OK, that was dancing. I was almost 20. OK, nothing happens. That's not a check your character realizes you need to make. Oh, continue as you were. Sorry, I'll re say that.
Speakers 00:35:44 You passed so nothing happened. It's not like you got charm and you didn't realize it Okay But I also didn't notice anything at all This wasn't something like where if you pass you're like, oh somebody tried to read my mind just whatever was gonna happen didn't succeed cool cool Let us go to the left
Speakers 00:36:11 All right, then I think I'll start heading down the path that I think is correct. While I get to read about him. Can I, again, try to be stealthy? Yeah, go ahead and everybody can roll a new stealth check if you'd like. I'd like to aid Leo. Oh. You can't stealth yourself and aid somebody else. I know, that's kind of a joke.
Speakers 00:36:42 I know, I'm just gonna really lay that down first. Yeah, absolutely not. I'm like walking right beside you. I'm like, Zario, Zario, how much further in this dungeon are we gonna be going? And I'm speaking incredibly loudly, clanking around. Yeah, I like to imagine while he's talking at full volume, I'm like, Leo, you need, look, no, look, quiet. You gotta be quiet, shh. Be quiet.
Speakers 00:37:10 quiet quiet okay okay sure then that'd be sneaky okay as you guys progress down the tunnel same deal as before you look up to your left
Speakers 00:37:28 and you see that after the tunnel sort of goes down dark for a bit there's like a bunch of light at the end and you put together this is probably just another dead end and logically thinking it through you're thinking oh we probably made so much noise when we first came in that there were creatures in these areas that just sort of rushed to you in that sort of initial fight so this could have been potential encounter areas but you guys
Speakers 00:37:56 It's just empty now. So unless you like want to explore it, you know, there's nothing down there. As you sort of peer down to your right, you see the tunnel splits off into three areas. But more than that, the farther you get down into this tunnel, the bioluminescence sort of grows and there's
Speakers 00:38:19 more, a greater myriad of colors. You have cool blues, vibrant green, soft purples, and it's almost like an alien, otherworldly light. As you go deeper, some fungi hang off the ceiling and delicate tendrils, like natural chandeliers giving off their own lights.
Speakers 00:38:39 Others sprout off of the ground and the floors, narrowing the path in certain areas, creating full obstacles that you have to cut and push down to get past. The atmosphere seems to change. Moisture in the air increases, clinging to your skin and armor, dripping from the ceiling and off your nose. You even feel like a rhythmic, pulsating breath as, as you go deeper, the floor fully gives away to
Speakers 00:39:09 like mycelium like tendrils and just growth in like the meat of the mushroom just makes up everything different colors even like ferns and stuff start sprouting like it the mushroom gives way to just natural growth and everything sort of undulates as it's breathing you guys hit this sort of forked way which way do you want to go
Speakers 00:39:42 Hmm What do I what do I see from there The tunnel in front of you you see a little bit farther, but there is like a mist and
Speakers 00:40:00 that is so thick by the end of the tunnel that it almost makes everything fully disappear and the tunnel takes a steep dive further down and because of that the mist fully fills it and you can't see but looking to your left you see a tunnel that bends and looking to your right you see a tunnel that bends the other um
Speakers 00:40:27 I can only see to the corners, left and right, but straight ahead, there's thick mist. Something is different there. Not good. Well, boys, you think going to the mist or... Yeah, follow the danger. What a good idea, friend. I don't know about that, to be honest.
Speakers 00:40:58 It's all right, Leo. We'll keep you safe. Well, I suppose, but I don't need to breathe. What if the mist affects your lungs? I'll take a cloth and I'd like to just put it over my face. I know in-game it's probably not going to do anything, but it'll make my character feel better. Will this help, Leo? Sort of tie a bandana around your face. Yeah. Cowboy style.
Speakers 00:41:28 All right, giddy up. Let's go. Well, maybe you should wait here. I could go investigate that mist and, you know, report back real fast. I'd hate for you to get hurt, Zariel. How would you know if the mist is safe if you don't have to breathe? Hmm.
Speakers 00:41:49 Well, you know, I might be able to deter. Valid question. I can't breathe. So I'm going to go into the poison toxic mist. Yeah, it's fine, guys. It's super fine. Come on, man. Check down the pathway to see where it goes. You might have meant that as well. Oh, OK. I pull a small canary out of my back pocket. All right, fair point. I have no way to determine that.
Speakers 00:42:20 Well, you could still go ahead and just take a peek if you'd like. I don't know how well you can see in this darkness. Metagaming, even though he doesn't have to breathe, Warforges are only resistant to poison damage. So he, like, might just start taking damage would be a way to tell, but that's up to you if that's knowledge you guys would take into game. I've never seen a Warforged. Right, yeah. No, you haven't ever seen an Automaton.
Speakers 00:42:48 Yeah. I knew that I would be more or less immune or resistant to it, so my intention was to go in and maybe sample the mist somehow, but I don't know if that's possible. Explain how you would sample it. I don't know. Maybe my armor has an ability to pull in some of the mist and do some analysis.
Speakers 00:43:17 I am gonna say no. Run it through your computer. It's a great enough benefit that you don't have to breathe. It would be a little, like we talked about earlier, a little OP if you could just also like duck in and instant analyze the air quality, you know. Yeah, no, that's fine. That's where I was at. You are welcome to investigate because
Speakers 00:43:41 you have a pretty good hunch that you're not going to take damage up ahead. Nobody's tried, but you're pretty confident that if you walked ahead, you wouldn't be poisoned by what you're breathing, at least. So if you were just like, let me scout this out, that's totally fair. But if you guys wanted to take a different path, you could as well. Now, once Zariel points out that I wouldn't be able to determine if it was unsafe for them, I'll just kind of nod and go, oh, yes. Foolish of me.
Speakers 00:44:18 Well, maybe I'll get up to the edge of the mist and I'll just put my torch up to it and see if it reacts a little bit. Put your torch up to it and it's sort of like light
Speakers 00:44:37 blindness where it the torch light reflects back heavier making it harder to see but the mist swirls and dances letting you know that it's thick enough at this point that like brushing away isn't going to instant reveal it it's not like a thin layer but you truly get up to this point you're like i can't see shit in there interesting
Speakers 00:45:06 Well, what do you say, fellas? You wanna... ...into the breach, or...? Yes, let's move forward. After you, Sario. I will lead the way... ...down into the mist. You guys start heading down, and I'll reiterate it...
Speakers 00:45:32 The torches blind you with the amount of light that gets reflected. It's just constantly off of a thick surface. So it's like driving in heavy snow or fog with your brights on. You see worse with the light you're providing than not. But you start walking down this path and you all quickly find that it's not poisonous. It's just like gathering moisture and the environment gives off this sort of ambient mist.
Speakers 00:46:01 As you walk forward, you guys don't really see a whole lot, because you're blind. Put your torch out. I was wanting to, uh... That's okay, never mind. I'll cover up my... Well, I wanted to, when I first stepped into the mist, to kind of, like, pretend to choke, like I was dying. Oh, you can do that if you'd like. Alright, I'm gonna make a performance check. Negative one.
Speakers 00:46:31 I got a 17, just like, ah. Both of you give me an insight check. Okay, Leopold believes it. Okay, I run over to Zariel and I scoop him up. I just step backwards, I just step backwards. I just grab him and I start running.
Speakers 00:46:57 I'm running with him out of the mist. I just hide to him.
Speakers 00:47:06 He got so far so fast. Would that be a strength or a... If you resist, it's a post-athletics check, but otherwise it's just a regular athletics check. I'll let him grab me, but I'll... Once we start running, I'll be like, Leo, it's okay, wait, wait, it's okay. It's a wait, wait, hang on, hang on. So I didn't get him strapped down very well, so I'm just kind of dragging him by one foot. You don't go as far with only a 10, you make it about half the distance you want to do.
Speakers 00:47:34 Hang on, hang on, hang on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I was joking. It's okay. It's just mist. We're alright. My head spins on a 360 degrees and I look at him and I go, Nazario is not very kind to joke around with such things. I thought you were dying. It's alright. If I'm dying, you'll know. Just plop on the ground. Dust myself off. Yeah, because they did think. Yeah.
Speakers 00:48:04 all right all right sorry guys i respect their own you know the mood was getting a bit a bit tense so well i'm quite jumpy in this cave and assuming that you were dying i was i was prepared to run all the way out well i appreciate it next time maybe grab caledon too because if i was dying he's probably going to die pretty quick after well i do suppose i apologize caledon no no ill will i hope it's fine
Speakers 00:48:34 Okay, let us... Can we see any better now through the fog? The torch is out. You put the torch out? Yeah, yeah, I sheathed mine so it was covered. Yes, uh...
Speakers 00:48:49 you douse your torches and you sort of wait a second for your lights to readjust and you find that you can see as well as or if not better than before the low soft purple green and blue bioluminescent lights they don't like reflect off the mist so the mist sort of your body just learns to ignore it and you just start seeing with a little bit of a haze
Speakers 00:49:15 The foliage grows thicker and thicker as you move down this tunnel. Very slowly, I'll add. You guys are trying to be stealthy, so even if you're making noise, you're not, like, sprinting down the hall, right? Right. You see, like, the bunches of ferns get a little more dense. You swear you see, like, tree roots sprouting out of the ground and sort of going in from the wall. Just, like, a little bit of a barrier you just have to, like, step over.
Speakers 00:49:44 Little bits of grass has popped up here and there. And you hear water running somewhere in the distance, but it goes from being dominantly fungal to being just like forested cave as you make your way down. But you guys, unless you want to keep going, that's what you see, I would say, in the first 30 feet of this tunnel. That sort of goes off the map.
Speakers 00:50:16 I'd look on the ground real quick and see if I can... I know it's been getting harder and harder, but I'd still like to see if I can notice any stray, like, broken leaves or pulled up roots from the guy trying to fight getting dragged down here. Yeah, go ahead and give me another perception or investigation. I'll do an investigation check for that as well. Mm-hmm. I'll assist, Kaladin.
Speakers 00:50:45 I will roll with advantage. Advanced. 14. Nice. OK, 21. OK. You can say with certainty that those drag marks are no longer present. I don't see it. Well. But the nation is right.
Speakers 00:51:16 Yeah. Oh, go ahead, sorry. I'm gonna say the Masonid life seems to be thicker here. Seems to be getting closer to something important. Do we want to continue this path? Albeit very interesting. Our friend wouldn't be down this way. Do we want to find the
Speakers 00:51:44 Didn't we notice... Didn't the drag mark go to that first dead end up here? Uh, that you saw... No, they never went to that spot you clicked. They went down this tunnel from the start area. So, you never had a clear idea, but you like... They went more this way because you figured that the one on this direction connected back to the beginning, so...
Speakers 00:52:12 The last thing that you would for sure know is that at the start of the mist at this would be like the last four certain area that you knew the track marks. We didn't see them go any particular direction at that juncture. You weren't checking at that junction specifically. Perhaps we need to look for tracks. Yes, I would agree.
Speakers 00:52:41 hit back up here all i'll help you look at the ground see if you can see anything and i'll just tell us assist caledon on anything he wants to do that try to see uh... disturbance you know specifically look for again sort of the what we've already seen these telltale marks of uh... from one being dragged in a little bit of a drug lord dirt and stuff is kicked around by assuming when there's burns and everything the grounds
Speakers 00:53:09 Pretty lush, or is that only the central tunnel that has that feature? The rest of the tunnels right now are just rock and dirt. Like, if you come back out to the three-way split? Yeah. That, uh, that was before it got that lush. Like, it was getting that direction, but out in this area, it's still, like, mostly my ceiling. Okay, yeah, can I, can I all roll for an investigation with advantage? Looking for tracks.
Speakers 00:53:39 To the left first. Are you other two helping him or are you just doing your own thing? I was helping him. I'm kind of aimlessly looking at the mycelium closest to me on the side walls here if there is one. Go ahead and give me another investigation if you'd like.
Speakers 00:54:08 You see they go this way. Do I see anything to the right of that tunnel? Nothing there? At 23. You see that on the wall is like an off-colored section of mycelium. Seems like protruding but doesn't match the straight wall.
Speakers 00:54:38 Okay. The tracks go this way. There's something different about the wall over there. I can't tell. It mentions that difference in the wall. Can I look at the color of that and the color of the thing that we just killed back there and see if it's similar? They're very similar. Can I just...
Speakers 00:55:04 Watch it to see if it's, like, looking at us, or aware of us at all, or see if it's showing any signs of life at all. I don't want to get close to it. Give me an insight check. Okay. Mmm, twelve. Twelve. Um...
Speakers 00:55:32 you can tell that it's like of the same material as like all the other mykinid creatures you've fought but this it does not seem to be moving as you are like very obviously staring its direction like it doesn't seem uh like it's going to attack you if that makes sense okay all right okay i just want to kind of clock
Speakers 00:56:02 where that is, can we follow the tracks? Yes, I think that would be the best. I'd also like to try to be stealthy again. I keep asking, the next one's going to be a disadvantage. Go ahead and roll stealth checks. Natural one. Great. Golly.
Speakers 00:56:30 Hey! I'm 11. I know, look at this armor, Nat 20. Hey, Nat 20. Yeah. With disadvantage, so. 15, that's still pretty sweet. You guys are on your way down. You make it to the corner, and as you turn the corner again, got a little ruler. You see that it again bends to the right, like curving around.
Speakers 00:56:59 But you hear, as you sort of get closer, this is over the progression of a couple minutes as you're moving like a half speed, right? It's not all instantaneous. As you're moving ahead, you slowly start hearing a soft, like squished thud, just... It's like you hear something moving, and it's at that moment that Zariel just... Sneezes really loudly. Can't hold it in, it's so sudden. And then the thudding just goes...
Speakers 00:57:29 and stops and you don't hear anything else and at this point I say you guys will have made it to like halfway down this tunnel as you're moving along when that happens uh oh sorry about that a bit dusty in here
Speakers 00:58:04 I'm just going to keep creeping forward if I can. I just want to see if I can see around this corner. Just Scooby-Doo style. Around the corner. As soon as your eyes reach the corner, you see standing there facing that direction just waiting.
Speakers 00:58:33 a large, hulking, fungal, myconid creature just lumbering, taking up the entire space of the hall, staring, waiting for you, just very aware of your presence, but just waiting to see what was going to happen. Everybody's going to have to go ahead and roll initiative. 15. Hmm.
Speakers 00:59:04 13. Great. 15, 14, 13. And this creature got an 8. First up, Zariel. As you preach the corner, it makes sense that you're going first. You see this instant shock, and then what do you do afterwards? I'm going to reach out, and I'm going to shoot out a thorn whip.
Speakers 00:59:32 at this creature. 13. 13 just hits. All right, I'm going to pierce my hand into the wall of the cavern. And as I do out of the floor around it, just a little bit of thorn is going to reach up and slash this guy for four piercing damage.
Speakers 01:00:01 and i'm a pull my hand back out of the wall and moved to the side and then we just see something here actions and then as a bonus o yeah as a bonus action of sorry i can't do that as a bonus action nevermind uh... a will stand there as a bonus action
Speakers 01:00:31 You stand there. Leopold, you were up next. You see a thorn whip. Runs into it. Does it get pulled? Does it have to do a save or anything? Um, I don't know. I think it says... If it's a large or bigger creature. Um, let's see. If the creature is large or smaller. So I don't know if this guy is large or not. It is large. Alright. Yeah, it pulls ten feet closer to me.
Speakers 01:01:02 10 feet closer, huh? Yeah, so Zariel yells, or sorry, Leopold yells, Zariel, why are you just standing there like that? And moves in, and with the hand crossbow repeating bolt shooter that
Speakers 01:01:31 was augmented into his armor. You see the turret pop up out of his arm and he points his wrist at this Myconoid and launches a bolt. 12 to hit.
Speakers 01:01:54 12 just misses. And in this case, again, the same as before, the shot goes into it and it just doesn't seem to find purchase as it does. It just sort of passes through the meat unfazing it. Okay, and then with my bonus action and my last remaining magic stone, I will hurdle it at this Myconoid, or rather my armor will. Roll to hit.
Speakers 01:02:25 21 to hit. 21 hits. 9 damage with that stone. Nice. Solid hits from Leopold. Up next, Kaladin.
Speakers 01:02:53 I think I would just, like, peek right at the edge of the corner there and use cantrip firebolt. Roll the hit, roll the hit. 16 hits. Nice. Oh, one fire damage. Oof. Just the one. What the fuck is that? It was terrible. And then I'll just sort of, like, be hanging behind the wall, get, like, kind of half-covered.
Speakers 01:03:25 a
Speakers 01:03:41 As it moves handedly into range, it looks directly at you, Kaladin, from the corner and you see it just sort of like spews these spores out into your face. Give me a DC 12 constitution save. As that happens, it looks back at Zarya and it just takes a huge fist attack, trying to hit you directly in the face. Yes.
Speakers 01:04:10 That is a sturdy 20 to hit. Oh, yeah. You take 9 points of bludgeoning damage and 8 points of poison damage. Alright. Ow. That is the end of its turn, though. Zorro, you just got whopped, but it is your turn again. What are you doing?
Speakers 01:04:41 Mmm. I would like to turn into a dire wolf and bite this guy. Roll to hit. Alright. That's gonna be... Mmm.
Speakers 01:05:11 can no hang on i have packed tactics so i have advantage 21 21 hit much different story all right that's good nice nice recall all right um the target if the target is a creature it must make a dc 13 strength saving throw or be knocked prone
Speakers 01:05:44 Eleven. It is prone. As I turn into a wolf, I jump up and I put both paws on him and just take a big chunk out of its clavicle and shove it to the ground. It takes a hearty hit and then you shove it directly to the ground. Next attack, next melee attack will have advantage.
Speakers 01:06:16 And that's my turn. Good turn. It pulled you up. Good job, Zariel! At once we must fell this foe! And I jump over his prone body and run down this hallway a little bit. You run past it? Yep.
Speakers 01:06:46 It takes an attack with disadvantage against you. Okay. That is a 15 to hit with disadvantage. Doesn't hit. Misses. Tinks off your foot as you jump over. I kind of spin around and I scoff and I say, how dare you? And you hear my crossbow wind up.
Speakers 01:07:18 and I launch one at him. Go for it. 21 to hit. Nice. I have 21 hits. 7 damage from the crossbow bolt. 7 damage, no choke. Alrighty, is that all you can do? Yeah. Is that the end of your turn? I do not have any magic stones.
Speakers 01:07:49 Let me think for a second. Yep, that's all I can do. Okay, Kaladin, you are up. The creature is still prone? Yes. From where I'm currently at?
Speakers 01:08:19 I will cast Burning Hands. It needs to make a deck saving throw. It is prone, so I believe it does it. Disadvantaged? Yeah.
Speakers 01:08:46 receive is thirteen uh... gosh i think that he need without a year at the last second missing uh... for the burning and in the in impressive display of dexterity uh... it's okay to have been a journalist at best who's taking a real it'll get a little stage but it takes five points
Speakers 01:09:22 Uh, anything else, sir? No, just kinda had to keep hiding behind the wall there. Nice. Next up is this Mykonid Sovereign. Like I said, it tips up to its feet and it just sort of like rolls over to be standing straight. It looks... Realizing that Kaladin was a mistake last time. Directly at Zariel.
Speakers 01:09:46 and it lets out just a hearty breath of spores. These ones, a light pink. As they hit you in the face, go and give me a constitution saving throw. And then as it does that, it'll just take a huge clubbing fist and try to attack Paladin. It uses half its movement to get up, obviously, but it still can get right in the mix of both of you. That, oh wait, do I get to use my, I get to use my stats, don't I?
Speakers 01:10:16 Wait, no, I get to use my mental stat. I believe you take mental stat, yes. Yeah, okay, so that's, yeah, that's gonna be a four. Four. You are pacified. You are stunned for one minute, you can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of your turns. Bummer. And then Kaladin, 11 does not hit? No. Then that is its turn.
Speakers 01:10:45 Sorry, I'll give me a constitution saving throw at the end of your turn, please She's gonna be purring Wait wolves don't purr do they? No Not really I am very natural one You're just feeling real Sleepy the wolf lays down with its feet tucked underneath itself like a little loaf of bread
Speakers 01:11:12 Yeah, it's gonna curl up like a ball. End of your turn. It is Lillipolt's turn. Witnessing this barrage of attacks on my friends. The armor sensing it's in danger. Sucks in three more stones from the cave side walls and they start floating above my head. And I will use my action to cast Magic Stone.
Speakers 01:11:40 And then one of the three stones pauses in midair, dials in on its target, launches. And damn, I don't think that hits. 11? It does not. And with that, that is my turn. Low-level combat's so exciting. Callon, it is your turn.
Speakers 01:12:10 uh... season rate in front of me now he's within the range uh... all use shocking grass nice right twenty-four his smart smart move seven percent in ice good hit uh... and i and i was that backwards you will take an attack at this advantage on
Speakers 01:12:40 He can't. Not with Shock and Grasp. That's the whole reason. Oh, because it did affect them? Nice! Yeah. It hit. Alrighty, well then. You get away nice and safe. Back up is the Myconid with nobody else in reach. It looks down at Zaryon. It's going to take an attack with advantage at his stunned form.
Speakers 01:13:09 Is he still a wolf right now? Yes. Okay. 17 hits. Yes. You take 6 bludgeoning damage and 8 more poison damage. Does this break my, uh, pacification? Great question.
Speakers 01:13:38 It is the stunned condition, and it doesn't say anything about taking damage breaking it. No, just that it's happening. Yeah, damn. Just a misleading name for it, calling it pacifying stone, of course. You do come out of your wolf form, however. Why? Because you drop.
Speakers 01:14:07 Did you take the 14 damage? The 16 damage? Yeah. It's 6. Okay, I thought you were at 6 before, because I didn't see a chain. Oh, hang on. Sorry, guys. So, I went down to 6 in my regular form, but my wolf has 37 hit points. So I'm down to 23. Okay.
Speakers 01:14:29 So I have, right now, I have 23 on top of the six that I have. I'm tracking it on my extra sheet. I'm not sure how to track it otherwise. That's great. I'm just upset, Wolf. Is he going to do anything else, or can I roll another to try to break free? Well, you're the only thing next to him, so he will...
Speakers 01:14:57 I hit you with a blue spores as you're just on the ground, give me another constitution save. Cause you're the only creature it can just sort of pick on. 15. 15 passes. Your turn, go ahead at the end of it, make that constitution save. All right. 15. 15, you pass.
Speakers 01:15:22 You rise from your stunned form, legs shaking, but coming to full consciousness. Fortunately, it's now Leopold's turn. Oh dear. This is quite the miconid. And my crossbow hums again and fires off another bolt. Go ahead and attack again.
Speakers 01:15:48 Ah, come on. Eight misses. Just not finding great purchase as it just disappears into its cap, not seeing it anymore. Bonus action. Shake my hand and look at the crossbow launcher and think to myself, I need to tune this when I get back to the camp. And I will then launch a magic stone at it with my bonus action. Roll to hit again.
Speakers 01:16:17 For fuck's sake. Oh my god. That's pretty good. Oh man. Misses, obviously. Goes overhead, just hits the ceiling, knocks some dirt down. Yeah, I think Leopold's very frustrated. He's gonna be working on his armor later. Well, I never.
Speakers 01:16:47 And next up, Kaladin. Sweet, now I've got a little distance. I'll use Firebolt. Go for it. Hold the hit. 16. 16 hits. And 9 damage. That really makes up for the 1. Yes, that does. 9 damage. It is looking very hurt. I'll step back 10 more feet.
Speakers 01:17:12 You got it. Just so we're caught up to date for the session, Jesse has rolled three nat ones and Rex has rolled one. Keeping up with him. Nice. Jesse is just really taking an L with these rolls. It's, you know, it's, it's, it's good. You know, it's good. Up next, the Mike Knit. Well, it's got one person to pick on. It's going to...
Speakers 01:17:39 Eject more pink spores at your face. Give me a constitution saving throw. Just going to give it a little whimper. It does 11 faith. You are stunned. It'll now make an attack with advantage against you. You guys sort of are watching an onslaught from two different angles. This creature is destroying some real right now.
Speakers 01:18:10 uh wanted to hit oh yeah oh sorry ignore that that's the wrong button again uh you take seven points of bludgeoning and four points of poison all right up next is ariel
Speakers 01:18:42 Oh, that's me, sorry. New character. That is you. I will attempt to break free. 14. You successfully do so. Leopold. I am once again going to take aim with my crossbolt launcher and attempt to strike this Myconoid.
Speakers 01:19:12 A crossbow bolt. For fuck's sake. Unfortunately, that also misses. Good miss. Maybe just like, reflect your page or something, you know what I mean? Yeah. Maybe adventuring isn't for you. Well, you know, he's used to his books. Prefers the library, to be honest. He's just learning how to aim. Yeah, I need to take some range practice when we get back to camp.
Speakers 01:19:43 With the last magic stone I have hovering above me, it will pause in the air and fire off. 16 to hit. Hits. Nice. 7 damage. It is on death's door. A huge edifice cap explodes. That's my turn.
Speakers 01:20:17 Sorry, your turn. Sorry, Caledon, your turn. I'll cast Firebolt again and hit with a 19. Nice. We're four damage. How do you want to finish it? Just another precision blow, like Firebolt right to the face. And I think it would sort of like melt into it and then it would just sort of
Speakers 01:20:46 crumpled to the ground as it sort of incinerated. Just the head would, so the body would just... My head is destroyed. And that ends that combat. It goes quiet again. The last echoes of the shock sort of rattle through the walls before nothing.
Speakers 01:21:19 I'll move forward to Zariel. He's still in his wolf form, correct? Yeah, can I roll to try to break free from the stun? Yeah, I still got hit points. Oh, yeah, go for it. You can make it every six seconds, so. Natural 20. That's exactly when you need it. Exactly, I was just going to say that. The timing was perfect on that. All right.
Speakers 01:21:50 Um, uh, let me check something. I'm not sure if I can talk in this form. I don't think you can. Well, I don't know, Druid? Druid? I can, uh... Is this a shape? Is this a shapeshift? Or not shapeshift, uh... Wildshape? Wildshape. I maintain all of my intelligence, but I don't know if I can physically, like, make the words happen. You could, you could sort of respond. He doesn't have a hard and soft palate.
Speakers 01:22:19 I'll, uh... I'm gonna take my little paw, and I'm gonna... is the floor drawable? Like, can I, like, scratch a little... I'm gonna scratch out, uh, rest with a question mark, and then I'm gonna... look up at the two of them. You need a short rest, boy. It's okay, you can short rest.
Speakers 01:22:44 Oh, Zario. Oh, indeed, I suppose. I don't need to rest in my, well, my immortal form here. I'm just gonna pan a few times, like, and then I'm gonna do a couple circles and curl up and just try to get a little catnap. Yeah, you go and start that. Kaladin, what were you trying to do?
Speakers 01:23:11 Can I look down this tunnel, just to see what I see? Yeah, go ahead and give me Perceptual Investigation as you make your way down. We'll do just a more general Perceptual... 12. Uh, 12. Yeah, as you make your way down... Hold on, I'm trying to find something. Um...
Speakers 01:23:37 you get about halfway down and it's hard to miss. There is like, what you can only assume, I mean, you make it up pretty quickly, is the person you're looking for, but they have been like, you figure the time that you had taken on that first short rest was more than enough time because this commoner is, doesn't seem to be no longer conscious that they're at least maybe even dead, but it's like,
Speakers 01:24:04 half absorbed into the walls of this and you see like one arm is stumpy and meaty and looks like just a giant club of a fist of like them and part of his face is sort of transformed to this horrible gnarling mess of tendrils and mushroom cap. Uh, not moving at all. Yeah. Very evident that he's currently sort of being transformed. Yes. Yeah.
Speakers 01:24:38 Oh, I would just point that out to the group. Oh dear, what has this man undergone? I think he's being assimilated. Yes indeed, it appears that way.
Speakers 01:25:06 Yes, maybe we rest right here for a moment. And maybe this is evidence. Yes, I would think so. Also, I missed if we are doing another Spotify thing for this session. It's in the chat. It's a sneaky little button you got to hit, yeah.
Speakers 01:25:41 Okay. Alright, cool. Well, I'm just gonna relax if I can. My, uh... Oh, what the heck? I clicked on the thing and it said that the jam already ended. Did you click on the most recent one? Mm-hmm. Unless you're in lore. Are you in lore? No, it should be in this game chat.
Speakers 01:26:05 The one that we're in right now. Oh, oh, oh, okay. Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. I'm, I'm using my phone for discord and I'm using my computer for the thing. So, okay. Let me get in there on this and then, okay, cool. Cool. Let me know. Are we able to, uh, get our short rest in? Yes. Go ahead and roll your short rest. If you have any other hit die, go and roll them. Any abilities that reset on a short rest?
Speakers 01:26:37 No, I already used my arcane recovery. I can't do it again. I need a long rest. Yeah, same here for my pit dice. I don't need to rest. Yeah, I'm still cruising at great health. Do you guys need to take the short rest? Then if none of you can do anything in it, is there a point in resting? Maybe. Probably not.
Speakers 01:27:06 I mean, I get my wolf. That's up to you, sir. I get my, uh... Wild Shape, right? Yeah, I get my Wild Shape, and that... It might be worth it in that point. That's why you said you get... I figured you didn't get anything. Yeah, let me just... try to get the music on. Sorry. Yeah, I'll do it just to get the... to get that, if it's cool. If we're not under the gun for other things. No, I don't think so. I'll do that.
Speakers 01:27:36 And yeah, same thing plays out. And as Kaladin found that body, I'm back on the screen now, it revealed that these tunnels are in fact connected.
Speakers 01:28:05 So you're saying that the link is in the game log? Yeah, like if you're in the chat, it is, you know, open game chat should be sent from today. Like on the VTT? No, it's in Discord, in our chat.
Speakers 01:28:32 Oh! Okay, yeah, sorry. But hold on, I can send it in VBD if you'd like, that's probably easier. No, I got it. I remember now from last time, I made the same mistake. I was looking for it in the general chat, not the game chat. Alright, I think I got it. Alright. Sweet.
Speakers 01:29:01 Oh, this is good. This is good music. All right. Very, very upsetting. So my wild shape can last an hour. So if it's cool, I'll just still have used a wild shape, but my health will be reset.
Speakers 01:29:28 And I might just mechanically I'll just I'll drop it and then re redo it. When I when I want to later that way it's not weird. OK, yeah, however that works out. I mean, feel free to look at it. OK, alright, so you guys do your short rest. Also important to remember if you need it,
Speakers 01:29:58 your stonewall legionnaire armor has like a built-in free basic healing pot that you get one for short rest is how it mechanically looks out where like the rune will burn and inject it like directly it's like on the inside of the chest plate just freely gives it you still have to use the same action economy for it but you guys have at your disposal a free healing pot that you don't have to pay for
Speakers 01:30:25 Is that just like a generic healing potion? Like 1d4 plus 4? 2d4 plus 2, yeah. 2d4 plus 2. Okay. At early levels, they're good. Later. Can I have used that for this short rest? Yes. Alright. You are gonna need it. See ya. See ya. Nice.
Speakers 01:30:53 Okay. We've already got the Mycenaean head. Do we need to take Mycenaean? Yeah. Do we need to take this? If you'd like. That is up to your characters. Right, but we just need to prove. This guy. Yeah, this half-changed body.
Speakers 01:31:23 Well, let's do some... So this process is occurring fairly quickly then, isn't it? Yeah, um... Through the short rest, did we notice how much more he looks changed? It took you... it took you an hour to find it. It looks like...
Speakers 01:31:37 You like sort of monitor it and it's it's pretty quickly growing when he's like attached to it but when you just have him pulled off he's on the floor like little tendrils over time you see like if it was a time-lapse photo series you'd see them sort of like wave as they grow up towards his body and like try to reconnect to it and he's like actively trying to digest them. Is this guy like clearly dead? Yes. Okay.
Speakers 01:32:07 All right. Do you guys want to do dialogue in character, or do you just want to talk like we were just talking during the short rest here, just as us, about what's going on? I don't mind. OK. Well, yeah. So I was just going to say, it seems like,
Speakers 01:32:36 We have enough to show what's going on, but we obviously haven't fixed the problem. Do we want to explore the rest of this before we go in deep with the foliage? That foliage area was a dead end or did it go down a steep hole? It was like a hole. It just went off map.
Speakers 01:33:06 It was like a steeper tunnel, it wasn't a hole. Okay. Yeah, let's... I would... We can backtrack just to see what that other common area goes to. Yeah, we might as well clear that out. I don't think there's too much up there, so hopefully it'll be a little quick excursion. Yeah. You make it all the way up there... And you do find that...
Speakers 01:33:35 it splits into two tunnels at first but one of them is just a dead end and in here once you make it all the way to this little like nub doff area somebody give me everybody give me an investigation check 15 oh nice 22 yeah same
Speakers 01:34:08 Uh, you see... 22 and 15. Did Kaladin want to make one? I did. 16. Oh, it wasn't showing up for me. Yeah, I didn't see it either. Yeah, it's not on mine either. Let me reload. Um... All pretty good rolls. You find... uh... painted... on the wall... in blood.
Speakers 01:34:37 a little picture of like a bird of some kind and it says one for sorrow in common. Can I do a history check there to see if that relates to anything, maybe part of the dome or maybe a group of people or something like that? Yeah, go for it. Can I make a nature check to see if I recognize what kind of bird this is? Yes, I like that.
Speakers 01:35:08 Well, nothing comes to mind for that. It's a chicken. It's actually, you're 100% certain it's an albatross. Got it. Strange to see one of these in these parts, but that's exactly what it is. I'd bet my life on it. I just take my arm and pat down and say, what do you think this bird is?
Speakers 01:35:36 I just say it, it's an albatross. I bet my life on it. Albatross, hmm. Yeah. Notice the wings. That's how you know it's an albatross. Anything with these wings is an albatross. Oh, okay. Yes, of course. Yep, I note that. And I reach for my journal, but it's not there. Your journal's gone?
Speakers 01:36:07 No, remember, I don't have any pockets. Yeah. Oh, all right. It's a force of habit. Do I clock this? Is this something that I recognize?
Speakers 01:36:30 Do I notice it or not? Or, I don't know. I mean, it's pretty, it's pretty apparent. I'm not, like, hiding it. I just kind of reach for what I think would be my journal. Yeah, you all see it. Interesting. Well, boys. You ready to... go, uh... deep in the... soggy tunnel? See what's down there? Yes, let us go.
Speakers 01:37:01 Indeed. All right, let's go. You guys make your way down. Do you go quietly, very quickly? What's sort of the pace here? I would vote quickly until we get to within earshot of that one guy on the wall, and then relatively quietly the rest of the way. Yeah.
Speakers 01:37:31 You sort of go past and then make your way back at normal speed. Eventually, again, it becomes very lush green, but it's eerily silent other than just like the light from that's constantly present and tickling in your ears. You feel a pressure just slowly come in over time. Just like a weight on your shoulders, and it's like almost like you're being watched at all times.
Speakers 01:38:02 But eventually the colors give way to just like rough dirt ground and all of the mushroom is purple. And the tunnel keeps winding and eventually you find yourself in an enormous open room. Of like large purple mushrooms, a raised ceiling. You have ambient light and lightness sort of flowing in from all directions.
Speakers 01:38:31 Uh, there's a large mound of just like concentrated mushrooms in the center and some patches off on the sides. And it looks like at the very far end of the room, there's like an unnatural fog that sort of rolls off the wall and hits the ground and sort of like waves crashes silently towards you. But it doesn't like progress actively, but that's just like, it looks like a misc waterfall just in the back wall. Uh, what do you guys do? I'm gonna.
Speakers 01:39:00 go into my wolf form. Okay. And I'm gonna make a perception check if I can just to try to see if I can smell or see anything out of the ordinary. Oh, are you untrusting? I'm very untrusting. And I have advantage on perception that relies on hearing or smell. Yep. You will get advantage.
Speakers 01:39:35 15 15 uh there's a smell of rotting flesh and that thick musk that you get from fungus and when you like
Speakers 01:39:49 close your your wolf eyes you shut up all your senses but smell you almost see just a trail of black smoke rising from the center mass and being slowly wafting towards your nose as you're picking up the scent of large undead energy right in the center of the room i'm gonna lift my paw and just poke in a very like human
Speakers 01:40:18 kind of way at the mound of black, and then I'm gonna, you know, point my tip of my paw down like a thumbs down, and then shake it. What is it, Zoriel? Oh, oh dear, oh yes. I turn to Callum and I say, I don't think he really likes the feng shui of this room, if you know what I mean.
Speakers 01:40:47 Awesome. Fungus shway. You guys are having a lot of fun with this. So we make note of that mound. Can I do like an investigation check to see if I, is it, is it reacting to anything? Is it just
Speakers 01:41:12 It just looks like you can from your current distance, but you'd have to do it with disadvantage. As you are 40 feet away. 13 13 you don't really notice anything from this distance.
Speakers 01:41:33 Is it just the mound in the center, or are there other things kind of surrounding the floor? Are there other, I don't know, mushrooms? There are a bunch of, like, little grounds and raises in the floor and past patches of, like, the map doesn't do it justice, but there's, like, a few four or five foot tall, just, like, mushroom stalking caps sprouting out. Large roots come from, like, ceiling to floor, giving some partial cover on certain spots. And there's, like, huge mist waterfall at the back of the room.
Speakers 01:42:03 But that's it other than like the decaying mass of whatever is in the center that you can't make out from here. Okay, can I make an investigation check? Is there a toadstool or a mushroom nearby that I wouldn't venture too far out of the... Yeah, they're all over. You could find one anywhere. Or I guess rather a nature check. I guess what I'm looking for...
Speakers 01:42:27 is if there's any potential booby traps with these mushrooms to see like maybe there's something that will trigger if we step on it or make too much noise or whatever and if it will set off some kind of poison or alert or whatever.
Speakers 01:42:47 mm-hmm yeah you uh go ahead and do a check nice you pick up a very specific one you don't stray too far you like maybe strife
Speakers 01:43:01 uh straight for like 10 feet to the right and you can get to like a rather large mushroom and as you're like walking under it you almost hear it swaying just under its own weight just a slow dull creak as it moves side to side and as the bioluminescent light catches very specifically at a certain spot you see untriggered like in stasis these black spores just sort of twinkling in the air
Speakers 01:43:28 and you just flash back to a memory of you in, like, this very well-off-to-do laboratory. There's a familiar voice behind you saying, Very good, Leopold. You're going to be excellent at making potions. Try this one. It has Deathcap in it. And it flashes back to common time, and you're like, Oh shit, this is Deathcap. This is very toxic.
Speakers 01:43:59 I'll turn back to the group, let's see. Oh, Neo-Nosarial, how you were talking about those voices in your head earlier. Well, um, uh, some bad news. I think that the voices are telling me these mushrooms are quite poisonous. Um, death cap, actually. It's best to stay away. Ruh-roh. It's fur. I figured I could talk like Scooby-Doo.
Speakers 01:44:27 yeah that's great give me a performance check no let me have this okay uh minus one three just dog sound
Speakers 01:44:54 So knowing death cap, would I know that there's a specific way to maybe disarm it or put it into a safe state? Or is there a check I could do for that? No, this mushroom is normally, and mind you, normally they're very small. These are like death caps that are at least 10, 11, 12 feet tall. They like are huge in the room, just sort of brushed up against the wall of the cave. Uh,
Speakers 01:45:21 you got a nat 20 to sort of ascertain that these can be used for harm and that it would be not great to be near them. Got it. Well, Kaladin, what do you make of this? I don't know. I cannot see anything from here.
Speakers 01:45:52 I want to move forward to see what is this mound. Uh, nod my wolf form and I'll start slowly making my way in towards the mound. And I want to also, uh, help him by looking. I want to see if I can see any entrances or, or like whatever discerning characteristics about this mound. If I get within 20 feet of it, does that give me a, just a regular role or is it still disadvantaged?
Speakers 01:46:22 Within 20, let's call it a good 15 for a straight roll. Because investigation is like taking a good look at something. You can make a perception check from farther away, fine. I'm just figuring you're asking for investigation because it's a good number. Yeah. I can do perception. Yeah, poop. Roll to 4. 22? Yeah. Nice.
Speakers 01:46:52 22. Hold on, let me finish writing something. We'll change tones here. Everyone within 15 feet immediately dies. No, not bad. Yeah, it'll work if you get within this many feet. I don't like this music. The mass in the center of the room starts shifting.
Speakers 01:47:17 yeah a sudden cold chill washes through your body and standing to its feet a creature of immense size it wears like spread out on its body broken up into different pieces like sort of just like not where it should be you see pieces of what are very obvious just like standard stonewall legionnaire plate armor but like
Speakers 01:47:44 The fungal behemoth before it is twisted. There's towering over most of it. Huge caps sort of come out of its back, out of its head. Its face is just like striations of fungus and muscle. It's like sickly. There are areas that almost look like skin. You swear there's like a nose shaped portion of mushroom.
Speakers 01:48:10 You see like purple spores just sort of gently float out of like the cap that's like a hat over its head. And it wields, it picks up off the ground a huge blunted root-like trunk of a club that sort of oozes with black goo. Oh man. It sort of takes its stance, like sets its shoulders and stares directly at the three of you. I need everybody to roll for initiative.
Speakers 01:48:42 When I saw it stand, I moved my wolf over in front of Kaladin. If I could have done that, I would like to have done that.
Speakers 01:49:20 Already, with a 17, the first up is... Paladin. Do we have a... Do we have a better idea of what this creature looks like? Like a picture? Yeah, like a picture. I don't know. This is something I made up, but I'll see if the picture I have... ...sends to it. I just don't know if it will or not.
Speakers 01:49:52 Because it might send the fake token that it's based off of. Put it here, let me try. No, it sent it. That's what I went off of, but it looks a little bit more badass on that. That's cool. Yes, I'm gonna cast Firebolt. Go ahead and roll to hit.
Speakers 01:50:23 Net 20. Oh, yeah. Oh, God, look at that. Damn. It's the best cantrip I think I've ever seen. The sweet, sweet. 19 damage is no joke. A huge hit, you see a portion of its shoulder ignites and then burns out, leaving a little dent in it.
Speakers 01:50:54 you hear like a heavy breath just escape sort of like this think of like vertical uh iron poles and like a mast like that's sort of what it mimics is like the mist steams out and it seems to set its shoulders towards you but before that can happen it is zariel's turn oh i want to i want to move back a little bit it's a lot for now i mean now i'll fish for him i'll cut to the side
Speakers 01:51:22 I'm gonna snarl, and then I'm gonna run directly towards this guy, and I'm gonna make an attack with my Wild Shade form, which is back up to full health at 37 hit points. Gonna make my bite action. Bam! Ah! Oof.
Speakers 01:51:49 That's an eight. Uh, eight does not hit. Not surprisingly. Just kinda jump up and bounce off. Yeah! Um... Having missed... I think I'm gonna...
Speakers 01:52:19 Just to kind of test out this guy. Nah, nevermind. I'll just stay where I'm at. I'm gonna hold strong. Alrighty. You don't know this, but this is Landsex the Fungal Guardian. He's gonna take his turn.
Speakers 01:52:43 The first thing he does is he looks at the direwolf in front of him and he ejects out of his mouth a black cloud of spores directly into your face. Give me a DC 13 constitution save. 11. 11.
Speakers 01:53:04 You are poisoned for the next three rounds. While poisoned in this way, you will take 44 poison damage at the start of your turn and each of your turns. Uh, you can repeat the save at the end of each turn here together. So 44. That's not a joke. At the start of your turn. Okay. Gotcha. It'll then make an enormous club attack onto you.
Speakers 01:53:33 It only gets, not a huge bonus, a seven misses. Swings right overhead, doesn't seem to find purchase. After its turn, it is Leopold. Okay, with my action, I will spin out another three magic stones.
Speakers 01:54:02 And then with a bonus action, I will launch one of the magic stones at the guardian. Go ahead. 21 to hit. Nice. 21 hits. 8 damage. Nice. You guys are killing it. Excellent, Leo. Oh, dear. These stones really have a mind of their own.
Speakers 01:54:33 And then I will kind of... What's my movement? 30 feet. I'll go for it. Move up 30 feet to right there. Is that all on your turn? Yep, and that's my turn. Great. Zariel, you are up. So I take 4d4? Yeah, 4d4 at the start of your turn. Do you want me to roll it or do you want to roll it? I gotcha.
Speakers 01:55:03 Okay. Now you take 10 damage. Okay. Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry. It's not your turn. I have you at the end of initiative. Oh yeah. Yeah. I took the wolf is in your place. It's actually Kaladin's turn. So you'll take 10 damage on your turn. Okay. Gotcha. But you were at full for now. All right.
Speakers 01:55:34 Um, I'll point my quarterstaff at the big fungus and do it again. Oh, it's not going anywhere. Natural one. Ooh, natural one. Pew! Uh, yeah, that misses.
Speakers 01:55:58 It just, like, hits the cap and just doesn't even burn up. It just seems to be absorbed by, like, this black goop coming out of the head of the cap. Next up is going to be the Direwolf, which is Zariel's turn. All right, so I took 10 damage. I took 10 damage at this point. You can roll at the end of your turn. So you'll take your turn now and then roll. All right.
Speakers 01:56:27 Again, I'm going to try to attack it. Because you are poisoned, I have disadvantage on this attack, I believe. If I get within five feet of Leopold here, will I be able to use my pack tactics? Can you bridge the distance for five in between each? If I can, can I do that? Currently...
Speakers 01:56:58 Yeah, your figure's big enough that you take up that much space. Okay, sweet. Then I should be able to balance out. Just even. Uh, damn it. Uh, ten to hit. Ten misses. Alright. And then I'll finish up by making another constitution saving throw. Uh, twenty-one? One passes. Nice. So am I- You're no longer poisoned.
Speakers 01:57:27 Nice. Alright, that'll end my turn. Next up is Lancex's turn. He looks furious that you're there. And you are... I mean, directly in front of him.
Speakers 01:57:44 Nobody else is ever there. He's going to use, uh, he breathes out like a, a deep violet purple into your face. And then as he does, he's going to take both his hands overhead and go to swing down on you. But before that, uh, go ahead and give me another DC 13 con save. A little bit of everything is just con. You do not go unconscious. So the attack does not have advantage, but he's going to roll to hit. Come at me, bro.
Speakers 01:58:26 I don't like how long this is taking. That's probably... Sorry, I was typing it out. Oh, that's fine. I was just concerned. Uh, no, 14. That's it. That's all it does. Oh yeah! Leopold, your turn. You are currently blocked by this dire wolf. Okay, I will step...
Speakers 01:58:50 just a little bit out from behind him, and I'll say, Zario, get down! And raise my arm. He'll hear the whirl of my arm crossbow and launch a bolt. 10 to hit? Yeah, 10 misses. Okay.
Speakers 01:59:12 And then with the second magic stone, it will focus its gaze on enemy and fire. Oh, for fuck's sake. Can't hit anything. Not your round, not your round. Do you want to roll with real dice for a little bit? See if you have any better luck?
Speakers 01:59:39 I trust you'll tell the truth. Jesus Christ. Have you tried unplugging it and plugging it back in? Yeah, I should probably try that. Well, you know, unless you move, it'll be a Kaladin's turn. Okay. I've got a good line of sight. I'm going to cast another Firebolt. Not going to hit him. Not going to hit him.
Speakers 02:00:02 No, it does not. Same deal, just find a viable purchase. There's no vulnerable vulnerable vulnerable spots. You see, I rolled over that one. It's like as every second goes on, it almost seems to grow a little bit in size, like more menacing. Kaladin, at the end of your turn, it is the dire wolves turn. Go ahead. Sario.
Speakers 02:00:29 All right. Gonna pounce forward. Now, do I still get pack tactics? Or did he move too far? Okay. So now that I'm no longer poisoned... Big money. Oh, yeah! Natural 20. Yes. Oh, nice! 26 piercing damage. As I just chomp on this guy.
Speakers 02:01:02 Well done, Zariel! Get him!
Speakers 02:01:10 a huge hit you bite into its shoulder like put your feet up onto its chest and pull away and the arm comes off and you hear a scream all of you do in your heads of just a deep guttural no and then you see like all the mushrooms on all the perimeters start to shake violently as it enters its second form nothing happens mechanically other that other than that there will be layer actions going forth now okay
Speakers 02:01:42 And that's it. Your turn, Direwolf Jesse. Actually, if it's okay, on a hit, he has to make a DC 13 strength saving throw or be knocked prone. Which really doesn't matter because it's his turn next. So even if he fails, he can just get back up, but it'll make him feel dumb. That's what matters.
Speakers 02:02:09 yeah it's all about asserting dominance the lone wolf the alpha well he only rolls a six so he does fall back that's right bitch we're just sitting here
Speakers 02:02:31 so fast that you hit him, you kick him down, he hits the ground, and then he instantly goes right back up. It's almost more intimidating than it is a joke. Don't do that. I really spun it on you there. Don't say that. It's going to swing its club out in front first, spraying you with the same black spores. Give me that con save, and then it'll come back with the second hit trying to hit you. 14. 14 just makes it.
Speakers 02:03:06 And then my AC is also 14. With a natural 20, it hits. Ouch. You are about to take a lot of damage. With my luck, I would like to make you re-roll it. Do you have luck? No. I do not. I do not have that. Okay, do you have any resistances to damages or anything like that before I just do this?
Speakers 02:03:36 Yeah, whatever damage you're gonna give, I have resistance to. No, I've got nothing. I have 27 hit points in my wolf form. You take 38 points of damage. Ooh. Ow.
Speakers 02:04:06 So I drop my form, and I have one hit point left. It absolutely drops. You see Zariel gets crushed into the ground. The whole floor collapses like a half inch. Not a whole lot, but when it's solid ground, it does make a difference. It turns its attention to Leopold, now disregarding him. Leopold, it is your turn.
Speakers 02:04:37 This guy ain't messing around. Oh, dear. Sorry, I let me. And I run over here, ensuring enough distance so that way I don't have disadvantage when I attack him at range. And I attempt to hit him with my crossbow. 14? 14 misses. Oh. Oof.
Speakers 02:05:07 All right, then with my bonus action, my last magic stone. 17? Come on. 17 hits. Hit him with a stone. All right. Hit him with a stone. Nice. Max damage. End damage, good hit. End your turn. Yep, that's my turn.
Speakers 02:05:36 Zario, it is your turn. You are in Dire Street. I love that Dire joke though. So you lose my... It goes Lantrex, Leopold, oh you're at 15 again, that's right. Yeah. Thanks for keeping me on it. It's all good, I mean I would have taken it. It is Lair Action 20,
Speakers 02:05:59 Breath of Death sets in, all of the mushrooms spray out. Anybody who is not within 15 feet of Lancex is going to take 3d6 necrotic damage on a DC 15 save. So that'll be you, Kaladin. DC what? DC 15 con save. Con save. I'm okay. Nice. 41. Nice.
Speakers 02:06:31 Then you can resume your turn as normal. Third time's a charm. God, another miss. That was so bad. Three rounds of nothing. Seeing Zariel get rocked maybe shook you a little bit. This is the first dangerous encounter you have had as human beings.
Speakers 02:06:59 That's it. I cannot do anything else. On Lancex's turn, he's going to... So, real quick. Sorry, I don't want to interrupt. Normally, I had been before him. It actually is better for me to be after him because then...
Speakers 02:07:18 Yeah, because if I'm after him, my prone thing actually is really helpful, but it's not, so... But I am aiming for him. Well, you're ahead of him. I'm just gonna make it one higher so it puts you ahead. Okay. I'm gonna use my second wild shape. And that'll turn back into a wolf. Sweet. Recharge those points. So I'm back up to 37 hit points plus my one hit point.
Speakers 02:07:45 for my guy, and I'm going to make a bite attack. I'm gonna move over, if I can, again, to try to get back to tactics with Leo and advantage. Is that something I can achieve? Yeah. You'd have to use half of your movement, I believe, to get out of... Well, you weren't actually prone, that was just for later. Yeah, keep going. You do you, Kane. Yeah!
Speakers 02:08:13 That's gonna be a 24. 24 hits. Alright, this is gonna be 13 piercing damage, and then another DC 13 strength saving throw. Just so he can get backup. Beautiful. See, I'm mean. These are dire consequences. Because he's a dire wolf. 17.
Speakers 02:08:43 Then it is his turn. Seeing your sudden re-emergence and being fine, he again takes a swipe of the black spores into your face. But you see, more deftly than you've seen, because he hasn't moved yet, he dashes directly in between. He'll take the swipe on Leopold instead. Going to con save from Zariel, and he's going to roll to try to hit you.
Speakers 02:09:17 Nine on the con. Ooh. You were poisoned again. Oof. It was almost a natural 20, instead he rolled a five to hit you, Leopold. Five does not hit. I did not think it did. Leopold, that is your turn. He's pretty close.
Speakers 02:09:51 I will actually take a step back and suffer the attack of opportunity. Which he will take. That is a 19 to hit, just misses. Okay.
Speakers 02:10:20 Then I will go ahead and use my hand crossbow and attempt to hit him. Come on, crossbow. Yeah, really killing it with these crossbow. Oh, goodness. Oh, my God. Dude, next session, you're going to have like eight nat 20s. Yeah, one would hope. Statistically. All right, that doesn't make contact, presumably.
Speakers 02:10:49 No, it does not and I use my last magic stone, so That is my turn All righty up it back at initiative 20 the only one again who is only see maybe Leopold is now He is here exactly at 15 Both you go ahead and make that DC 15 con save I
Speakers 02:11:22 Nice. Okay. Ooh. Well. Leopold, you take... 10 points of necrotic damage. As you feel it, like, just drains your energy. Where the spores hit, burn and sear, even into your armor. Ooh, ow. Ooh, that does not feel good.
Speakers 02:11:51 Up at the top we've got Kaladin again. Alright. This time I'm just going to close my eyes and point in his general direction. Alright, there we go. Hey, that worked better. 22. 10 damage, at least that worked out. He's starting to look pretty hurt.
Speakers 02:12:22 And I'm really playing with fire here, so I'm gonna move forward. I'm gonna get right inside his... his 15-foot bubble. I don't know where that's at. Uh, 15 feet would put you right where you are. Okay. Uh, it is Mr. Sariel's turn. Alright, I'm gonna... Uh, I'm poisoned, right? Yes. So...
Speakers 02:12:53 Am I able to... Yeah, you take 44 damage on the start of your turn as well. Okay. Do you want to do that first? Yeah, I gotcha. I have 13 points. Ow! That was a good roll. That was pretty decent. Alright. Um...
Speakers 02:13:22 Mechanically, I'm not sure how the map is overlaying with the size of the icons. Am I able to get pack tactics with Kaladin? Do you have your ruler turned on? Uh, well, I didn't know, because, I mean, he only looks like he's, like, five feet away. But my icon is, like, ten foot wide space, like, canonically, because it's a dire wolf, so I wasn't sure. I did the grid custom to the map, so it's as big as I want it to be. Oh, okay. It says I'm about 18 feet away from you.
Speakers 02:13:52 Oh, well, then my ruler's not working. Because my ruler says you're five feet away. Select the... Euclidean? Yeah, exactly. Oh, so now I'm... Okay. Alright, so let me try that then. So if I move over here... If you swing to this other side... Yeah, there you go. How does that work? Tokens be touching.
Speakers 02:14:22 Is that... I don't wanna... I don't wanna... Okay, I just don't wanna, like, uh... I don't want it to be a not-a-cool thing. So if you're cool with that, then I'll do it. Okay. That's fine. Dire wolves are large creatures, correct? That is ten to hit. Ten misses. And then a con save to try to break the poison? You got it. Nineteen! Passes. Yep! Ooooooo!
Speakers 02:14:58 Alright, that's my whole turn. Okay, okay. Uh... Mr. Mushroomface's turn is up. He's gonna look at you, he'll be frustrated, and he's gonna blow out those violet spores again. Give me another Constitution save as he goes to strike you again. It's very one-note. That's all he's got. Uh, eleven. You fall unconscious for one minute.
Speakers 02:15:27 Which means his attack will do great damage if he hit. Uh-oh. This could be bad, boys. You got a lot of life on this body. I rolled in person because I can't do advantage to my typed-in rolls. It is an 18 plus 3, so it's a 21 to hit. Oh yeah. I have 24 hit points in this form.
Speakers 02:15:58 He does 44 damage plus 3 on a hit normally, plus 44, uh, so it's 44 plus 4, plus 1 bludgeoning damage, and then 44. So it becomes 8d8 plus 2 plus 8d8. That was nice knowing you, Zario. I just said the wrong thing.
Speakers 02:16:27 It's trying to land the dicer stacked on each other. You take 46 points of damage. All right, so I'm not all the way dead, but I am down. Question. Yes. Man to man here. Yes. Does Zariel want to push harder? Does he want to give a little bit extra? Take that stress point. He does not want to die.
Speakers 02:16:57 He has too many unanswered questions. He will push for anything he can. Zariel, go ahead and level up and take the benefits of a full rest. What? You see this wolf get struck in a disastrous blow and instead
Speakers 02:17:23 of the wolf dissipating to Zaryl's form. You see a like iridescent oily metallic sheen tits instead. The club makes contact not with her but with like this other material like metal organic in shape and the wolf grows a little bit in size and Zaryl is a little more intimidating so to speak.
Speakers 02:17:50 But in between that, while Jesse figures his shit out, it is Leopold's turn. I rolled a 7 on my health dice. Nice. Yeah. Anyway, continue. Uh, Leopold. Uh, yeah. So, with my action, I will cast... But you, Jesse, obviously you take 1 stress point. Okay, I'll make a note. Magic Stone.
Speakers 02:18:17 And then using a bonus action, I will hurdle one of those stones at this foe. Go for it. It's 15, and then it just kicked over to a 5. That is my turn. I'm not kidding, man. Disconnect and rejoin. I guess I'll refresh here and see what happens. You're in a bad role.
Speakers 02:18:48 Yeah, I don't think I've rolled much above like a 6 or a 7 lately. I think you have 1 or 2 hits total on the combat. We're in round 5. Any movement out of you or are you just going to stay right there? I will sneak in just a little bit to avoid the 15 foot range on the... Beautiful.
Speakers 02:19:10 Because right after your turn on initiative count 20, the breath of death kicks in, but all of you are close enough to land sex that it doesn't affect you. Uh, let me count it as your turn. Oh, use firebolt for one damage. Damn. Alrighty. Any movement?
Speakers 02:19:41 Uh, no, I started my turn by skirting a little bit to the side so I had a clear shot. Uh, Zariel. Senor Level 3. Your turn, man. I... would like to rage. I'm just kidding. Um... It's not updating my health over here, but that's no problem. I am going to, uh... So I'm still in my wolf form then, right?
Speakers 02:20:10 Yeah. Okay. Let's see. I'm going to... I won't do anything too extra. I'm going to make an attack with advantage. And... Try to bite this guy.
Speakers 02:20:41 17 to hit. 17 hits. Nice. It's gonna be 7 piercing damage from my big wolf form, and then he needs to make a strength saving throw. The great thing about this guy is he's pretty much got the same thing to everything. 1d20 plus 3.
Speakers 02:21:09 Nice. That is a, one of the main stats he's rolling with at least now. Doesn't have very good intelligence. 30, 20 to stay up. All right. Anything else out of the kit? No. All right. He is looking a little frantic. You see panic in like his expressionless face.
Speakers 02:21:39 stress, like an aura of stress fills the room, and he's not nearly as healthy as he was. He is going to wrap around staying in your distance, but get in range of Leopold, and he's gonna throw out his deathcap spores at you while he takes a strike at the direwolf. So Leopold, give me a constitution saving throw, and he will roll to hit you, Zarion.
Speakers 02:22:05 Constitution saving throw, you got it. Does a 14 hit? 14 does not hit, and then I rolled a 17 on Constitution. Not on me, but on... 14 hits Aurel, you are 17 saved. Yes, got it. He has 14 hits. Okay, so he will do 144 poison damage.
Speakers 02:22:38 You take 17 points of damage. Woo. Ow. Ruh roh. But after your turn, after his turn, it is Leopold's turn. Okay. Uh, I will, uh, with my action. Well, I have a clarifying question. So I have these infusions and one of them is on my armor that allows me to, um,
Speakers 02:23:07 use a charge like every, let me read it. Expend a charge and add my intelligence modifier to a strength check or strength saving throw. So do I get to roll a strength check and then just add an additional modifier for my intelligence? Yeah, you would. You would just roll the check and then whatever the total was, add your intelligence modifier to it. Oh, okay, awesome.
Speakers 02:23:38 Yeah, so I'm going to attempt to shove him backwards so I can get a little distance between me and him and make a range attack without disadvantage. Alright, roll to hit for the shove attack. What would be the modifier on that one? Like to hit, would that be an on-arm strike? Uh, no.
Speakers 02:24:01 Let's just do, like, whatever your regular attack is. This is just to make contact, to, like, get solid enough for just to push him. It won't, it's not even, like, your attack action. So just roll your normal attack. Whatever you'd be better at. Uh, okay. Guess I'll do it on armstray. That's better than my crossbow. 22.
Speakers 02:24:22 22 hits so go ahead and push him I'm gonna say roll a d8 and we'll add 5 to that and that's how many ever many feet you shove him He goes hurtling backwards it was 13 feet back Lands
Speakers 02:24:50 Not mechanically prone, but slides on his butt before he rolls back to his feet. Anything else? You still have your attack action, correct? Yeah, my bonus attack. I'll yell, get back, you mushroom man! And with a bonus action, I will hurtle a magic stone. Roll to hit. 15 to hit. 15 just misses. Just misses. Oof.
Speakers 02:25:20 And that is my turn. Nobody is within 15 feet of the walls. So, Caledon, it is your turn. I'm going to use that trusty firebolt. Yeah, I'm not going to hit it. Not hitting it. You almost think at this point that this isn't going to affect it.
Speakers 02:25:53 Cuz I keep hitting it, but it just kinda like- Just doesn't seem to ever find a good spot. Yeah. All right, I'm gonna move forward just a little bit. Try to stay within 15 feet of him. Is there anyone there?
Speakers 02:26:21 Yeah, I'm here. I'm just looking at stuff. Sorry. Oh, I thought you said it was Kaladin. Sorry. Um... Alright. I am going to... Let's see... I'm going to... Say words. Um... Sorry, I'm trying to... Yeah, I'm trying to...
Speakers 02:26:52 Let's see what I want to do here. I am going to drop my wolf form. And I'm going to, uh... cast the spell that I've never used before. And a, uh... flame is gonna jet forth from my hand.
Speakers 02:27:19 And, uh, it's a bonus action to cast. A blade of flame is gonna pull forth from my hand, and I'm gonna take a swing at this guy with a flame blade. Fourteen to hit. Fourteen misses. Oh! And with the rule of thumb... Damn it. All right, well, it's still there. It's just sitting there flaming.
Speakers 02:27:46 It's very cool. It like gives off its own light that changes the dynamic of the light bouncing off of you. Sort of makes you a little more intimidating. Yeah, be afraid. That was my bonus action and action. Yeah, that's it. This fungal creature is up next, realizing still that the most
Speakers 02:28:13 injured one in the group just reading off of you is Leopold. It's going to dash forward again in between you, except it's going to change tactics. It'll try to hit Zariel with the spores as it takes a swing. As it runs, it's taking a swipe at you the whole time, so it tries to make contact at the last second. So, Taun, save out of Jesse, and roll the hit, even though your AC is very good. It's going to be six.
Speakers 02:28:43 uh that is a 22 to hit and then it rolls you fail so jesse you take 44 damage oh no this was the other one i intended to do the sleeping one uh you are unconscious for one minute unless you take damage or somebody wakes you up i have immunity to magical sleep
Speakers 02:29:07 via my constructed resilience. Is this magical sleep? Not to you. He's just hitting you. Oh, okay. I see. And it is not. It is, um... They're spores, and it just makes you go unconscious. Again, the names are just misleading. Got it. You are resistant to poison damage, correct? I... Yes, I am resistant. Okay, so you only take 2d4 of that.
Speakers 02:29:41 Now you take 15 points of damage. Oof. I go unconscious. Now, does Leopold go unconscious, or does he reach a little bit deeper? Leopold is locked inside the armor, unable to make a decision, and his suit of armor goes into self-preservation mode, reacting to this massive strike of damage.
Speakers 02:30:12 Actually, this has to be an action of the soul. Does Leopold want to go further? He realizes that if he lets the suit take over, that he knows he'll be in good hands. And so he lets go and allows the suit making the conscious decision. Leopold, you level up and gain the benefits of a short.
Speakers 02:30:44 but you gain a stress bonus. Where does that go? How are we tracking that? Just in your notes somewhere. I just put it under inventory. Make it an inventory item so you can change the quantity. Oh, good. Yeah. That's a good idea. That's a good idea. Yeah, that's what I was just thinking. I should make it an item in game so it's official. Yeah.
Speakers 02:31:19 And that works out very nicely. You said a short rest? No, you gain the benefits of a long rest. Oh, okay. Zorro, you took... Oh, I didn't roll, did I? I thought I rolled your damage. Didn't I roll your damage already? I didn't take damage, I just went to sleep. Because you wanted me to sleep. Oh, right, right, right. That's right.
Speakers 02:31:46 I keep thinking that the only one he has is that one, but I intended to knock you out. Okay. Well then, it is Leopold's turn. No rush. Does he know what he wants to do? Um, to do... Since you were leveling up, you could change out your spell if you'd like. That was something you intended to do. Do you want to do, like, a firebolt? Do you want to do something else?
Speakers 02:32:13 Yeah, I was going to switch a number of those things. I guess for now, since I do know, I was going to swap that cantrip. I'll just do that really quickly and then I'll look at my level 1 spells after this run.
Speakers 02:32:45 You guys could totally end him before his next turn. Gotta land those hits. I know. Alright. Okay, so with my turn, I will... How does this work? Is this an action? Using a new thing.
Speakers 02:33:15 Exactly what I was doing after this happened to me. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm trying to figure out. Okay. Yeah, so Shielding itself from a massive strike my armor throws up the shield and kind of from behind some extra protection pulls over Leopold's front and kind of cocoons him and
Speakers 02:33:41 He stands up autonomously without much control over his actions and materializing from behind him, kind of emerging from the cogs and the wheels, the clicking of his armor, stumbles out a figure that's smaller than Leopold, but still quite opposing, gleaming in steel. He rushes forward to attack.
Speakers 02:34:11 So I will call forth a Steel Defender using my attack action, or my action. And then- I was thinking like Unseen Servant or something. Is Steel Defender your homunculus or is it something else? No, this is something different since I have- Is it a Battlesmith thing? Battlesmith, yeah, exactly. So what does this item look like?
Speakers 02:34:37 It's a metal knight. He is clad in armor. He emerged from within my suit. How tall is it? How tall is my steel defender?
Speakers 02:34:52 I like to imagine you just gave birth to a little baby suit of armor. You create a Steel Defender that obeys your commands in combat. The Steel Defender shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move, use its reaction on its own, but the only action it can take is the dodge action. Unless I tote. You can expand a bonus action, you can command it to take an action from a stat to block or some other action. Yeah. It's just like, he's got this bodyguard now.
Speakers 02:35:20 Yeah, so I guess you could kind of imagine that, like, as I stand up, just like part of Leopold's armor becomes this steel defender, buds off, and it kind of runs forward. And I will command him with my bonus action to attack the enemy. Now, can he attack?
Speakers 02:35:50 Yeah, I think so. Because he uses action to cast a spell and his bonus action to give the order and then it acts on his initiative after him. And I'm just curious, how do I, is that under extras? Where do I go to that character sheet for that? Steel Defender.
Speakers 02:36:21 You could probably add it as an extra, but if you click on the word Steel Defender, it'll give you how to do stuff. Do you see it? Like, if you click on the bold Steel Defender... Right. Yeah, I see it. Okay.
Speakers 02:36:50 But that's, I think, the most you can do with it. This thing's pretty sweet. I tried to look it up as a token. It doesn't exist. So it's not like a deployable thing. Got it. OK, so I attack with the Steel Defender. It is my spell attack modifier to hit. 5-foot reach.
Speakers 02:37:15 If it makes a connection, it's 1d8 plus PV force damage, which I'm not sure what that is, but... So, uh... A player proficiency bonus. 25 to hit. So whatever your proficiency bonus it adds to it. Uh, 25 hits. My proficiency bonus comes from where? That's... It's like on the main stat near the top. It's like what you add to...
Speakers 02:37:43 things that you're good at doing. So it'll ever be like a plus two repeater. Instant near the top. Yeah, it's like right below strength if you're opening it in VTT. Like in the main banner, yeah. It should be next to your walking speed. Oh, I see. Two. Okay. 1d8 plus two. I don't think I've ever noticed that. It's a major bonus number to all your things, because as you level up it gets higher.
Speakers 02:38:12 Right. Aha! 10 damage. So 10 damage. Good hit on it. And that is my turn. Good turn. Initiative count 20. Breath of Death. Nobody's within it. Next up is Zariel. This is looking dire for this Bungle Warrior. I think it's Kaladin. Yeah. I can't keep skipping him. It's okay.
Speakers 02:38:48 I should add. Hey, Bran, if you want, I can start hitting your character so you level up. I love that. I'm going to just do just one more time. Goodness, just goodness. Miss, golly. I'm going to stay in my ground. OK.
Speakers 02:39:19 This sucks. Let me know if you want to try something else. Something creative. Yeah, do some slam poetry at him. If it feels spicy, we can do some stuff. That's alright, man. That's that round. He's coming down. Okay. Alright. Alright, it's your turn then.
Speakers 02:39:47 wielding my flame blade. I will move around to the side so that I can flank and get advantage. I was gonna tell you to do that if you didn't. And I'm gonna swing my flame blade. 20! Dirty. 20 hits. It's gonna be 3d6 flame damage. 9 flame damage. Very close to death, but that does not do it. Ugh.
Speakers 02:40:17 Oh weird hang on let me check something real quick casting time is a bonus action use your action to to use it okay never mind so I use my action I have my bonus action I have nothing as a bonus action
Speakers 02:40:43 Yeah, I'll just, for flavor, I'll just kick it. Alrighty, you throw in a kick, try to push it slightly towards Leopold, but before that, it is its turn. Not seeing any real weaknesses in your group, we're all very healthy. It's just gonna get desperate. It'll try to spore Leopold as it takes an attack, just alternating back and forth. Leopold, give me the con save.
Speakers 02:41:17 13. 13 fails, you take... Oh, 13, yeah. No, 13 passes. Okay. Beats it, beats it. And then 7 to hit Zariel, so I believe that misses. Yeah. Waste of a turn. Leopold, you were up. I was trying to clarify one other thing. If I've told it to attack, it continues to attack. I don't have to keep telling it.
Speakers 02:41:48 Uh, yeah. I'm pretty sure it would specify if on each turn you have to get the same action. Okay. Uh, this is why I haven't... It goes immediately after you, so it's your turn first. Yeah, got it. Makes sense. Um, okay. So, with my action, I will call up a, uh, Magic Stone.
Speakers 02:42:19 Give me a second, where did that go? There it is, okay. And then I will similarly retreat just enough so that way I'm out of close combat range, yet not extending past the 15 feet.
Speakers 02:42:47 Which I think will probably be an attack of opportunity. Yes, it will. But a 15 won't do it. Okay. And now, would I have advantage because Zariel is flanking? No, you have to be opposite from Zariel to get a flank. I see. Got it. So you would have had advantage, but you no longer had advantage. Right. No, that would have just been...
Speakers 02:43:17 where I'm at now. Okay, but I will attempt to hit it and will miss with a nine. And then I will pass over to my steel defender who will have flanking because he's standing opposite. I'll make like a custom token in between first to your steel defender. Yeah, that would be awesome because it's hard to keep track of.
Speakers 02:43:48 And I will... plus six to hit. Fourteen, I don't believe, hits. Fourteen misses. Oh, but I have flanking, so I have advantage. You have advantage.
Speakers 02:44:17 Yep. The Steel Defender's gonna kill this guy. Yep. So that was at 18, and it slid across my screen and then just flipped to a 4, so that was... Oh. Something is against you guys. This should not have... This... We've been doing this a while. End of your turn, and your Steel Defender's turn, and you should be down 20. Is anybody 15 feet, or just outside 15 feet? I don't see anybody's move.
Speakers 02:44:45 I'm gonna cast Firebolt. What up? Fourteen? Misses. Gah. Terrible. Terrible. The dice gods are telling me to fucking pick something else. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You know, throw like a tack at it or something. Caltrops, don't you have those?
Speakers 02:45:15 Not in a standard kit. I am going to... Does the steel defender count as an ally? As far as... Yeah. Okay. I'm going to, again, wield my blade of flame. With advantage. Take a swipe at this guy. Alright. You've grown on your last turd.
Speakers 02:45:46 And that's gonna be a 16 to hit. Yes. 16 exactly hits. Finish him. 13 fire damage. 13 points of damage. How do you want to finish it? Oh yeah. The gout of flame pours from my hand as I reach in.
Speakers 02:46:11 And I say, time for some roasted mushrooms. And I just slice right into his chest. And then slip out. Carefully carving off the head and trying to separate the legionnaire, like, little sigil symbol from the plate with a little bit of mushroom on it so we can save it for evidence.
Speakers 02:46:40 As you finish off this formidable foe, this guardian of this mushroom grove, in your head, just to you, softly, it speaks to you. And just as with its last emotional breaths, just goes, he's coming for her. And that's it, as it loses its life.
Speakers 02:47:08 Was that it's coming for her or he's coming for her? He's coming for her. Hmm. Interesting. I'll extinguish my blade. Look at the group. Do we seem like we're still in danger from the spores around us?
Speakers 02:47:34 No, everything sort of loses a bit of its luminescence. The purple is less obvious and the room gets darker. Alright, give me a perception check. Yeah. 20, 21. Nice. Sorry, I'll seize it all.
Speakers 02:48:01 With the fading of the purple light, you see a dim glow of green from beyond the mist. Which direction? Other than that, you see there's the weapon at this soldier's side alongside like tattered bits of the armor. And when you really search it over, you see on the nameplate of like, you find a portion of the right breastplate
Speakers 02:48:30 Uh, it says Lancex, like, etched into it. L-A-N-S-E-X. I'll just, uh, show that to the guys. And, uh, try to take a piece of that with us. Just, you know, see if there's anything we can bring back of this guy for a proper burial.
Speakers 02:48:58 Yeah, you could piece the armor together if you wanted. Yeah, just so we could have something to show. Give his family or something. I'll just look around at the other two guys and say, well... I don't know about you two, but uh...
Speakers 02:49:28 I feel kind of strange. I was pretty sure I was a goner there for a bit. But now I feel fantastic. I can't help but think that there's probably going to be some sort of repercussions. But I don't want to focus on that right now. Yes indeed, Zario. It was strange.
Speakers 02:49:58 I felt myself slipping away, but I knew there was something I could do to stop it. It's weird to have this companion here. I didn't know that was part of my armor. Yes, you both seem to die. What was this?
Speakers 02:50:20 Cal it and I really don't know to be honest. It seems like we're almost being rewarded for our reckless behavior Yeah, but I didn't actually take a hit that hole Yeah, when we first got in here he landed like 30 or something crazy like that on that Yeah
Speakers 02:50:50 And then I think I only hit two more times out of like six rounds. Yeah. I was thinking that though, after I went down and that whole thing happened, I was thinking, damn, Bren plays his character so well that he's going to end up like level two by the time we're like level 18. Because he's never going to put himself in any danger. He's going to be so strategic. Didn't do it in game. I mean, in the fight.
Speakers 02:51:19 Yeah, I know, it's more of a joke, just because he plays so well, he plays so strategic for his character. Yeah, he does. Very used to the distance playing for the caster. Yeah, you play it fantastic. He's playing just a wizard, you know.
Speakers 02:51:43 Okay, so we've, uh, we've fallen this guy. Should we, uh, should we take what evidence we have back? I guess we need to do some more investigating, huh? Is there anything of note in the room now that this has happened? We just kind of saw everything dim. Just, um, the weapon, the armor, and the green glow from beyond. Uh, what is the weapon?
Speakers 02:52:09 Uh, like a, like I said, like a tree trunk root. Like the root of like what you used in this game. And at the end it like oozes like black sludge. When you say the green glow from beyond, um, where is that glow coming from? Oh right, you did ask direction. Uh, over here. Can I go look at that please? Yeah, is that where the mist waterfall is?
Speakers 02:52:38 Yeah, that is beyond that. While I'm walking... Oh, go ahead. Sorry. I was just gonna say, while they're doing that, I'm gonna harvest some of these death caps. I'm gonna put as much as I can in my bag. Or give me a... nature check? Yeah. It'll let you know if you do poorly, you're taking poison damage. Oh, for fuck's sake. It's a jewel.
Speakers 02:53:06 What'd you roll? It's not coming through. Oh, a three plus four for a total of seven. You take one poison damage. Am I able to get any of these? Yeah, you get some. Also, you get like two death caps, but they're, say, smushed. You didn't do it with Grace. Got it. So they're going to be less effective at whatever you do with them.
Speakers 02:53:36 While I'm walking over to this thing, I'm just gonna relate to them the... You guys, as this thing was dying, it said, uh, he is coming for her. It said it in a, like, sorrowful, compassionate tone. I don't know what it means, but I would imagine that it has relevance, otherwise it probably wouldn't have been said.
Speakers 02:54:04 And then I'm just gonna make my way over to this thing and see if I can see what it is. You walk up and as you sort of breach the fog, the mist, you see at first just like a stone altar, but on top of the altar you see a woman. Let's see, can I send it to game one? Did you see? Yeah.
Speakers 02:54:33 She's young, fair. She's got like dirty, hanging down brown hair. And on her face is a mask constructed of like a well-crafted glass that bends around the shape of her nose. Hewn leather straps keep it on her face and inside are these plants that just take up the entire thing. She seems unconscious, but she's breathing.
Speakers 02:55:03 Unresponsive to anything, she's just almost in a full stasis. In between worlds, just fully not present. I'll, uh, yell for Kaladin. Kaladin, hey. Hey, uh... I might need somebody's help with this. This woman is... She's got some weird stuff going on. Come take a look. Would I...
Speakers 02:55:32 Can I do, like, an Arcana check to understand is this mask safe to remove? Is it just keeping her asleep? Give me an Arcana check, and you can do it with advantage. But you don't get to know why. I'm gonna do it again. That was the first one. That did not help me. Oh, god damn. Those are cold dice. You feel... You feel like you're missing something.
Speakers 02:56:00 but you do not know what it is. You don't get anything. You can't tell if it's vital, what it is. I'm not sure. I've not seen anything like this before. Can I go up and see where the plants are coming from? Whether they're self-contained in this, like, self-contained breathing apparatus, or if they're coming from somewhere else?
Speakers 02:56:30 Uh, yeah, give me an Arcana check. Oh, Arcana? Ouch. Okay. Uh, three. That same deal. This is... This is crazy to you. You've heard that people, uh, it could be a curse, like, a manifestation of, like, the esoptic curse. There's always some weird things, but this is... This is, like, just, like, as purely nature-based as you've ever seen anything.
Speakers 02:57:02 Jonathan, could you spell that? You can give me a... Give me just a Wisdom check or saving throw. Give me a Wisdom saving throw. Spell, you want a Soft Trick? Yeah. Ah, nice. And then I was also wondering if I could do that Arcana check.
Speakers 02:57:34 Yeah, go for it. Hey, a little better. But I'm looking for something. Sorry, what'd you get? 23. 23.
Speakers 02:58:03 Your suit, just without your permission, sort of does, like, uh, an arcana, like, um, detect magic. And you get... And nobody you know has ever been there. It's sort of just of, like, a fairy tale. Uh, just reach fey magic. Hmm, interesting. This is emanating quite a bit of fey magic. But, I mean, it is beyond powerful.
Speakers 02:58:33 Quite a bit of power coming from this. What does that mean? What does fey magic mean? Isn't that a place? How does a place have magic? Well certainly, I would assume that Leopold would know that there is a connection between the fey wilds and the material plane and magic can kind of bridge between them. Yeah, that's like pretty common knowledge that like it can happen but
Speakers 02:59:01 Since all of you have pretty much only ever spent life inside of an arcane protective dome, nobody's ever seen anything like this. Well, Zario, let me say, I did once read this book titled The Feywilds and the Magic that We All Feel Between Us, in which it dictated a natural bond between these fey places and our world. So it's quite possible there's a tether here that we're not seeing with our own two eyes.
Speakers 02:59:34 Well, I think we can all agree that this is not a safe place for this woman. Should we try to bring her back to... civilization? Perhaps we can get people more... adept at this sort of thing than us to... Hey Brian, I'm gonna message you something. Okay. Yeah, can I have... been working on a ritual cast identify on the mask?
Speakers 03:00:03 Just learn more about it. So at the risk of getting us all killed, can I just go over and touch her? Just like on the shoulder or something. I don't want to like grab her or anything. I just want to poke, like poke her shoulder and see if- It moves her a little bit but she doesn't respond.
Speakers 03:00:33 I'm just gonna, while he's doing his identify, I'm just gonna be like, uh, uh, ma'am, uh, pop, excuse, uh, excuse me, uh, and I'm just gonna give her another little tap. Are you well? Um, you've got this thing on your face. Uh, excuse, excuse me, do you need aid? Zario, I'm not quite sure if she can hear you.
Speakers 03:01:00 And then I was going to do an investigation specifically on that breathing apparatus. Does it look like those vines are like going down her nose or into her throat? Like if we separated this from her, if it would be detrimental? It doesn't look like it goes into her mouth or throat, but it looks like some of it is like coming out of her skin in certain spots. Interesting.
Speakers 03:01:27 Has it been long enough for his identify yet? Or should we keep looking? Identify is 10 minutes? Yeah. Absolutely not. All right. I'm going to see if there's anything connecting her to this table, or if we could pick her up and start walking. She's just laying on top of it. You could grab her if you wanted to.
Speakers 03:01:56 Okay, well, since I see him preparing something, I don't know for a fact what he's doing, but I know ritual stuff takes like 10 minutes, so I want to wander a little to the left and a little to the right of her and make sure there's not like another woman on another table somewhere in the mist that we can't see. Yeah, that's very fair.
Speakers 03:02:22 If you got stuff hidden back there, okay, I was gonna say you could just, yeah, okay. It was in a weird part of the map, so I just couldn't undo it. Hey, hey guys, I just had a thought here. Maybe we do this whole identify thing somewhere safe. That mushroom dude said, you know, that this guy was coming for her, and then we found a woman.
Speakers 03:02:52 You know and to metagame he was called the protector and You know that that's probably who he's protecting I'm not gonna say that part cuz it's metagaming But the first part is is legit, you know, we could be in danger if if you know That thing we just took a while to handle was looking to fight against something else that he was worried about and
Speakers 03:03:24 Why, that's a good point, Zario. I could go for a little bit of R&R back at the bunkhouse. We should definitely get out of this dank place. I don't know. Can Kaladin talk while he's prepping this, or no? I think it's a flavor thing that'd be up to him.
Speakers 03:03:47 Uh, I didn't, I think maybe this isn't like too intensive, like a ritual cast, so you could sort of, sort of semi be interrupted and like jump back into the casting. Okay. Yeah. Uh, so Kaladin, uh, how much time do you have left? Do you, are you thinking that you want to do this now? Or, or maybe we could try this at a safer location. What, what do you think?
Speakers 03:04:14 Just depends in a kind of above table. There's how long has it been if it's a ten-minute effort like halfway through Give me just a few more minutes. All right. Do you guys just leave one out late? Yeah, I'll just keep an eye and an ear out just in case but yeah, I
Speakers 03:04:42 uh you get the identify back and same deal it is uh like fey themed magic and fey magic doesn't follow the normal schools so like it doesn't come back with like this is abjuration this is what it does it just says like
Speakers 03:05:01 you know, if it were a slot machine, it would just keep rolling back and forth between common magical legendary artifact, just like back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. It just reads all over the place. Uh, and it's magic feels innately like chaotic, but it seems to be helping her. Okay. I kind of share that with everybody.
Speakers 03:05:31 Guys, I think we should... We can move her. Let's go. So, above table, the armor that we're wearing, we can communicate through it. Was it made known to us that it is able to listen to us? You don't know, actually. It's like a central...
Speakers 03:06:00 You know it has a direct communication line to the Core at all times, but you don't know if it's two-way. I'm gonna take out a little piece of paper, and I'm gonna write down, um, should we trust her with the government, and then, uh, semicolon, or colon,
Speakers 03:06:31 Or I think it's semicolon. Continued thought is semicolon. Thank you. Semicolon. This seems kind of powerful and kind of crazy. Do we want to, there's a lot to write. I guess it seemed a lot more elegant in my head. I'll just leave it at that. It's scribbling in front of you. I know, I'm just writing and writing and writing and writing. During the 10 minutes. 10 minutes is more than enough time.
Speakers 03:06:56 Okay, alright, well then I'll finish my thought to say, do we trust everyone with her and this crazy magic item? That was my health roll right there. Life, hit roll. Nice.
Speakers 03:07:28 Well... I... I'm looking at this and... I kind of jot back. We should be careful. I'll look to Kaladin. And then I'll... I'll put a little note that says, uh...
Speakers 03:07:58 Maybe we should hide her somewhere safe until we get some more information? Yes, I'd like this more. Well indeed, Zariel. So astute of you. Let's be on our way. Alright, will.
Speakers 03:08:20 Let's get our evidence of our mushroom man back to the Legionnaires and let them know we've solved another case. Hopefully we get a better nickname than the previous fellow, although he seemed well-respected, so perhaps there's a correlation. And then I will pick her up and start walking out. Okay. You guys make your way slowly back through the tunnel system.
Speakers 03:08:52 Back up towards the top Unless you guys want to look for like a different way out. You'd have to like Very strenuously crawl up the piping that you came down, but I will let you know There's like there is a way out if you wanted to go forward. You just have to look for it I'll investigate for Yeah, sure
Speakers 03:09:26 17. 17 is great. Behind the altar if you like keep going you brush away some plants and there's just an opening in the wall with like a light rushing of water sound again something that you feel like you heard earlier and you walk in there's like a stream at your feet and as you walk down this tunnel over time the stream seems to pick up and is fed by more
Speakers 03:09:51 and more and then eventually you see like light in the distance and you guys as you keep walking it almost turns to a full like like brick of water like a running stream that's very consistent and you guys keep walking out and go ahead and just give me an intelligence check.
Speakers 03:10:23 Eh. 22. I don't know where I am. 22, 18, and 3. Zario's the only one who doesn't really realize it, because he's a real underground type of guy. But the rest of you instantly recognize, oh, we're like, this is, we just popped out in the Emerald Grove. Where are we? I think, I think we're still underground.
Speakers 03:10:50 Zario, this lush environment is not some place underground. This is the Emerald Grove. Yes, I know where we are. I know this place. Is that a riddle? I'm not great with riddles. I think we're back in the Storm District, although the really good weather is throwing me.
Speakers 03:11:17 You spend too much time in the court, underground. This is not that. This is the Emerald Grove. Alright, if you say so. I'll believe ya. I'm gonna take my jacket and try to cover her up. I mean, it's still gonna look like I'm hauling a body, but at least it's not gonna be like, oh hey, he's hauling a woman with a crazy magic thing. Yes. I gotcha.
Speakers 03:11:48 Well, boys, any ideas for our thing? Thing? Any suggestions for our, you know? Zario, don't you have a nice apartment? Could we maybe hide there for a bit? Yeah, I think the whole point was to not say
Speakers 03:12:18 where we were thinking of. So for the sake of argument, yes, that's exactly where I am going to go. Go. Yeah, I'm losing it. Yes, well, I do say that's where I am headed. And then I'm going to shake my head and then shrug my shoulders like, where should I stash this woman?
Speakers 03:12:52 I'll point at like a, like a nice, can I see any like nice natural, like, like an alcove or a crevice or a cave? Or, I mean, I know that's a lot to ask just popping up in the middle of the Emerald Grove, but is there anything around I could see that would seem like a natural hiding place? Um, you can give me a nature or perception or investigation check.
Speakers 03:13:19 depending on what it is, I'll give you disadvantage or something. It's a pretty big ask. Yeah, I'll just do perception. I'm just looking for any sort of like natural barrier, like even like some really thick bushes, not 10. I just want to stash her somewhere that I think somebody's not just gonna happen upon her. If I can't see anything good, we'll obviously keep looking. I mean, the Emerald Grove is like pretty,
Speakers 03:13:46 like pretty flat it gets like pretty lush in certain places it's a giant jungle district but like there's people with like druidic magic who take care of and live in these woods so like you don't know how good of a spot it is it does occur to you that like you just came out of a pretty secretive cave but like you don't know if that's safe anymore kind of deal that's a fair point
Speakers 03:14:14 What do you guys think, out of character? Otherwise you'd have to take her with you somewhere. Yeah, is this whole trying to keep her secret thing silly, or should we just... I don't know, what do you guys think? No, I don't think... I think keeping her secret is probably better, because I think if we... If we turn her over, it'll end whatever storyline. Gotta hold our cards close, I think, so it's probably worth the effort, even if it doesn't end up being that important.
Speakers 03:14:44 I'm just worried if we leave her where we found her, that when we give our report, they're gonna send some lackeys down there for cleanup and to make sure everything's good and they're just gonna find her. So, maybe Leo's right, maybe we find a nice place in the core, like maybe like an access tunnel that I know never gets used very often, or like a broom closet that I know
Speakers 03:15:11 very seldom gets used, or I could break a key off in the door or something. Would I know of anything like that, Jonathan, offhand? Like a secret tunnel? No, not like a secret tunnel. Just like, you know, when you work in a big conglomerate, and you're, like, working in the bowels of it, generally, you know, there's places that just don't get used very often, like, that maybe I could, like, try to, like, barricade up or, like, put up, like, an out-of-service sign or something.
Speakers 03:15:41 Yeah, I mean, you could find a pretty abandoned, uh, like, section of tunnel that just runs under, like, no area of population, so there'd never be, like, maintenance there, and gotta stash this girl there. I'll, uh, I'll take out my notepad, and I'll kinda just relay that basic information, and then put a little question mark on there. See if that's something that those guys would think would work.
Speakers 03:16:12 Alright, brilliant ideas, Ario. Let's go back to your house, like you suggested. And I'll look to Kaladin. Yes, um... We need to protect this woman. There's something strange about her. Well... I think that, uh...
Speakers 03:16:40 our work we've done will protect many women in the dome. Why don't we run this quick errand and get back to the Legionnaires and I would imagine a congratulations and perhaps some sort of promotion is in order considering we have foiled a major plot.
Speakers 03:17:08 I do suppose we, uh, we best be rewarded for all that dungeon crawling we did down there. That was quite a filthy place. It was definitely dank. So, uh, do we need to do any rolls or anything to see if we can successfully stasher? Or can we just say that we stasher where I'm thinking? Um, excuse me. I was desperate.
Speakers 03:17:38 Choked a little bit. Let's do something a little more fun. So I'm gonna have you guys make me just a pure luck check. Anything below a five will mean you run into another group of legionnaires on patrol before you make it to a safe space. Is that all of us? And one, there's just one, one more section.
Speakers 03:18:01 If you want to make sure she's in a spot that nobody will ever get to her for sure, we're going to add another luck check in there. So one luck check and there's a chance that somebody sort of finds her at some point if you're not checking in on her. Two of them, if you want to be like, no, we're going to go to this extra long spot far away that nobody ever goes to. And risk running into another group. Well, boys.
Speakers 03:18:32 Who's the last person that's rolled a luck check? Yeah, I did one earlier this session. I think I've only done one. So, it's between me and Leo. You guys are both gonna roll one. You go ahead and roll the one for being hidden, and I'll roll the one for bumping into Legionnaires. Alright. Oh, get out of here. Well, you don't know a very good spot, that's for sure.
Speakers 03:19:04 Well then, which one of us is the face? You. Oh, no, not me. Oh, Jesus. OK. All right. Lay it out for us. Wait, I thought yours was for hiding. Oh, I thought it was like one of us gets one leg and the other one gets the other leg. Oh, OK. But I could be wrong. I could be wrong. I guess that's up to John. That is it.
Speakers 03:19:32 It was just two sections of luck checks and you failed the first one. No, this is going to work out really cool. This just sort of throws something in, a little hook for later, you know. Zario knows this spot at like the far edge of the dome between the dawn and the emerald district that's pretty abandoned because it's just a long stretch of forest. He didn't know that personally, but he works on the inside of the tunnels a lot.
Speakers 03:20:00 and it was like like his rest spot where he wants to get away from people so but you can't access it from the it from the outside unless you go to the corridors but there's an access door pretty far out so as you guys are just walking along the wall carrying this body you've avoided just about everything uh but then like randomly you see this
Speakers 03:20:25 grotesque monster of like it's like a human but it has like four arms and the end of the arms are like blades and it's like screeching and howling and it's got these banged teeth and it's like not paying attention to you it drops from like some point on the wall and goes to sprint away and then you just hear like a and then the hitting in the ground is this like
Speakers 03:20:51 I mean truly one of the scariest looking individuals you've ever seen. It's like all black sleek armor that is like jagged points onto the pauldrons. There's no skin showing between the armor plates because it's like a black dark material. You don't know if it's metallic or fabric or like chainmail. You can't see through to eyes. You just see like black empty slits in there.
Speakers 03:21:19 It has this enormous, wicked-looking greatsword that sort of sits on its back, held in by a magnet. And on its shoulder is the symbol of, like, the general military of the Stonewall Legionnaire. And then on its other shoulder, you see an insignia that just has, like, a helmet etched into it. And you're not entirely sure what that is, unless one of you wants to make, like, an intelligence check.
Speakers 03:21:47 but like it like lands directly in front of you and all of the ground crunches under its weight. It takes its sword and it like throws it and just spins through the air like and it hits the creature in the back of the head and the creature lays flat and then this soldier like stands up and stares at you and it doesn't speak but then you see its head tilt down to what you're carrying and it just waits there patiently but quietly. So first couple things can happen.
Speakers 03:22:16 you can roll to see if you know what this is and then uh if you want to like say something do something anything after that you said an intelligence check uh or history but that's pretty sometimes it's the same role yeah yeah plus three big money
Speakers 03:22:46 Yeah, I'm gonna roll a history check on it to see. Come on, Leo. People, do it with advantage. Do it with advantage? Yeah. Yeah. Nailed it. That's awesome. Eight, 10, 12. None of you know who this is, but a 12 is high enough to know that that is like,
Speakers 03:23:17 That seems like a genuine, there's something about it that seems like it is actually some sort of soldier for the Legionnaire, for the Corps. But none of you are like, oh shit, this is blank. Okay.
Speakers 03:23:41 all right uh... i really shouldn't be the face because i have a and nine overall charisma score uh... you know my even actual minus one or zero i have a minus one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero
Speakers 03:24:10 see what they want to do. Um... With where we are, we might be able to... just have a conversation and say that we're heading to something, or... Yeah. Yeah, we could be honest in what we're doing, you know, like, uh, we just got back from a thing and we're bringing back evidence. Yeah. I mean, it's not a lie. No. I'd like to be... I'm definitely not gonna say it, because I have the worst stats of everybody here, so...
Speakers 03:24:41 That's him. I'll walk up to him. Hello. It stands up square, it's feet together, it stands tall. It is like a full foot and a half taller than you and it just stares at you silently. Does it have any like ranking insignia on it or anything? We just saw the crest knowing that it's sort of a vehicle for the Legionnaire.
Speakers 03:25:10 Nothing that you recognize. I'm just gonna act like I have a higher rank. At ease, it's okay. We're just passing through. Okay. Then it's just silent. Yeah, it's just silent. Picture of this thing, Jonathan?
Speakers 03:25:34 I don't have any that I can upload right now. I've been attaching the picture to an NPC and then sending the NPC to the chat, but I didn't download this image that I referenced for there. Got it. This is one of those, um, just out of game, because my character doesn't know this. This is one of those, um, like warriors that I saw on that board. It's like the Gloomstalker, or like, they had a really cool name. There was like two different versions of them.
Speakers 03:26:05 um this is one of those one of those guys so it's like one of the top two ranking like fighting people in the whole entire place so it looks autonomous though right it's not like this is a out i don't think so uh this is not something you guys have seen yet yeah this is not no i know the lord or an omen oh
Speakers 03:26:32 Oh, gotcha, okay. Well, that's probably what my character would think. Yeah, probably. That would be like, I think, the natural progression of thoughts from somebody that sees this. But if you had a good enough roll, I was gonna let you know what it was. Can I get an insight check to see if I can see how well what he said is going over?
Speakers 03:27:03 Just to see the overall tone of this guy. It didn't come through on my end of chat. Did you make, like, a persuasion check, Kaladin? I can give you a persuasion. Yeah, I might not have asked for it. I meant to. Natural 20. It'd be the time. Nope. Nope.
Speakers 03:27:29 Oh god. Natural! Oh god. Keep it up, Kaladin. All three of your runes on your shoulder that light up when you've got communication coming through, come in and you hear, um, it is always, uh, charming accents. Just, uh, you all have been requested at the core. I don't know what you did here. This is Ratchet, by the way.
Speakers 03:28:04 Why hello, Ratchet. Fancy meeting you again. Hello, coming in. Not entirely, I did tell you that there was communications on your gear there. Not sure why, but the captain wants to see ya. Right, well, we'll head in now.
Speakers 03:28:29 And then I'll, uh... You see this, like, armored knight that you can't tell anything about other than that looks pretty sick, uh, has, like, disregarded you now that something has happened, and it is walking to go retrieve its sword. What do you guys think? Do you think we should hide her first, or do you think the jig is up? No, let's go hide her. Do you know any spots on the way that would not take much extra time?
Speakers 03:28:59 So I feel like if we were gone for an extended period, they'd question what happened. The thing that happened already happened, so if you guys wanted to get it to that spot, you could. Okay, well then yeah, let's ditch her and then let's head back. Let's do it. Yeah.
Speakers 03:29:22 You guys stashed her in a place, and as you make your way back, I think we're going to call it there and pick up next time. You're like debrief. Awesome. Sweet. So are we thinking tentatively, not this coming weekend, but the next weekend is when we're going to try to play in person? Correct. 20th, 21st.
Speakers 03:29:49 Yep, it's on my calendar. Are you guys coming down? Is that the plan? Yeah. Yeah, is that alright? Yeah, yeah. I just wanted to double-double check. That'll be good. I don't remember who we've got playing for a band. I don't think it's one of the bigger bands, so... Probably not gonna be that... Okay. That's fine. Yeah. Alright. Is there a place to stay or should we plan on camping or something?
Speakers 03:30:17 No, no, we're going to be in cabins. We're not going to be outside. Sure. Well, I know it's summertime. I don't want to put you out, so... No, no, no. I'll block something out for you guys. He's made us wait so long for this finale. Let's make him fork it out. Yeah. We each get our own multiple cabin setup.
Speakers 03:30:37 Yeah, right. I don't know if you guys remember, but again, we've got insane bonuses to our characters. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's right. I know those boons are going to be out of control.

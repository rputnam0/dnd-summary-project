0:00:01: DM: A various of artists, whatever you want to call it. It's the continent that you're on.
0:00:10: Zariel: What's the quality of life for the lowest common denominator?
0:00:20: Zariel: Yeah, like, in the market districts, there are like slums of people living in like shacks and empires where it's like, you know, you've got
0:00:20: DM: Yeah, like, in the market districts, there are like slums of people living in like shacks and empires where it's like, you know, you've got
0:00:35: DM: houses and tents set up on other tents and houses and like everything is built into the walls and people live in the sewers in certain parts of the dome like it's not all good and people are aware of it but like obviously the people who live in the dawn or sweets district don't care about the poor people the emerald grove district is like mostly forested area it's like
0:00:56: DM: cycles the oxygen for the whole dome, and it's where a lot of people with nature-based magic tend to be.
0:01:06: DM: So it's less dense and populated, because each area of the dome has its own sort of flavor.
0:01:10: DM: They're all advancing, but I would say the Emerald Grove is the least progressed.  The Don District is the sleekest and nicest. The Market District is the most practical. Stone buildings, not all super tall, just dense grid-like layout.
0:01:30: DM: The Amberfields is like sprawling farmlands with just like ranches here and there.
0:01:36: DM: The Sweets District is nicer on moderate housing, spread out. People have lawns and stuff, but they're not huge.
0:01:42: Kaliden: And the Storm District is just rainy, but like also business and
0:01:43: DM: And the Storm District is just rainy, but like also business and
0:01:49: DM: like armors and things like that. Things of trade are done there.
0:01:50: Kaliden: Things of trade are done there.
0:02:01: DM: You need permission to enter certain districts. Most people don't ever leave their district though because it's just like
0:02:10: DM: not part of your day-to-day. Usually your job is going to just keep you in your district. It's rare and there'll be like certain circumstances you can bring up where it's like, would this person go between districts?
0:02:21: DM: And then the people who work and enroll in the Stonewall Legionnaire go in between districts for like their job.
0:02:24: DM: So that's why the occupation office is also very sought out, is because you get to basically go where the Corps sends you and the Corps sends you all over.
0:02:41: Leopold: There's no common reason for people to be trading between districts.
0:02:48: DM: Usually everything goes to the core and then the core divvies out everything to keep the whole city functioning.
0:02:53: Leopold: Usually everything goes to the core and then the core divvies out everything to keep the whole city functioning.
0:02:57: Leopold: Right.
0:03:01: Leopold: Are there any known tensions between districts, say one that has hate for another or something like that?
0:03:10: DM: There is, it's not super common. It'd be like, it's known that the Don District sort of looks down on the Market District for sure.
0:03:10: Leopold: There is, it's not super common. It'd be like, it's known that the Don District sort of looks down on the Market District for sure.
0:03:19: DM: The Emerald Grove District doesn't like anybody because they want to keep it as pure as possible.
0:03:26: DM: Things like that.
0:03:27: DM: People think people from the Amberfields are the classic stereotypes and prejudice.
0:03:35: Zariel: I see you put them on the southern part of the map.
0:03:38: Leopold: That's not very nice.
0:03:38: Zariel: I did what I could.
0:03:38: Leopold: I did what I could. Boy, howdy. Awesome.
0:03:44: Zariel: Well, I don't have any questions other than once we get situated.
0:03:45: Zariel: But I just want to say that I really like the setup.
0:03:53: Zariel: Thanks.
0:03:54: Zariel: That's awesome. Why don't everybody go ahead and roll a d20 and we'll see who gets introduced first.
0:03:55: DM: Why don't everybody go ahead and roll a d20 and we'll see who gets introduced first.
0:04:01: Kaliden: Just a straight up 20 or initiative? Just a roll a d20. We're rolling rolls either way.
0:04:03: DM: We're rolling rolls either way.
0:04:07: Kaliden: All right.
0:04:15: Kaliden: Not going first.
0:04:20: Zariel: I think we've got some good fantasy names.
0:04:29: DM: Leopold, Kaladin, Zerial.
0:04:33: DM: Caledon is first. Lois goes first. Let's go!
0:04:51: Kaliden: So I'm not being introduced to the other people? Am I just introducing myself? Are you getting ready to like make us all mean? Well, I'll work it into...
0:04:59: DM: introduction wise.
0:05:02: Kaliden: I'll put the C in here.
0:05:02: DM: I'll put the C in here.
0:05:07: DM: So as dawn cracks the dome, light filters in the opaqueness, lightening everything up, the street lamps dim their arcane bulbs, noise in general, doors open up, people start getting on with their daily lives.
0:05:25: DM: A
0:05:27: DM: Very oddly, fair-skinned, long-eared, gorgeous-haired individual steps out of their abode holding a piece of paper in their hand, a flyer they had pulled off of the wall the day before.
0:05:35: DM: This figure looks to the southeast, towards the center, the core.
0:05:51: DM: You've got hours to kill.  You're a very on-time person, you're prompt, you do things when you're supposed to, you don't delay, you don't want to inconvenience people.
0:06:02: DM: Plus, the earlier you get out to do things, the more experience you have with it.
0:06:08: DM: Kaladin, as you step out of your abode, what would the party see from this individual?
0:06:19: Kaliden: I think I would be dressed in like modest robes, like certainly nicer than just like traveler, but like nice, not like silks, but just nicer fabrics, earth tones, simple, nothing flashy.
0:06:35: Kaliden: I'm about 6'2 and 150 pounds, like very, very lean, very flowy, very graceful.
0:06:47: Kaliden: Like Jonathan said, I've got long, silvery hair, and I've got, like, very blue, like, Azure ice eyes.
0:06:54: Kaliden: Yeah.
0:07:03: DM: Nice. And as with most people, you're just a regular dude. You don't have an enormous sword strapped to your back. You don't have a leather-bound tome dangling from your side, you know?
0:07:04: Kaliden: And as with most people, you're just a regular dude.
0:07:17: DM: magic of that caliber isn't seen in everyday people but you like to learn especially with a lot of the dreams you've been having recently you feel driven to change something uh whether that be to obtain a new potential or just get a new experience uh on your itinerary for today kaladin is
0:07:34: DM: heading to the core to tryout for the most recent tryout batch of Legionnaires. There's more recruiting going on, it's a higher paying job, it promises travel to see the other districts, it offers to train you to hone magic ability, you know, all of these really great things, and so because of that you're like, fuck it, let's do it.
0:08:11: DM: Alright, and then... So Kaladin is heading towards the Core.
0:08:13: DM: Do you want to do anything on your way? Um... No, I wouldn't know to do anything else today.
0:08:24: Kaliden: I think I would be fairly purpose-driven to want to sign up or do whatever I need to do to enter the Trial.
0:08:38: Kaliden: Okay, nice. All righty, as you head towards the core, give me just a perception check.
0:08:54: DM: Good roll.
0:08:55: DM: First roll.
0:08:57: DM: You are walking down the street, and just for a brief moment, as you walk down,
0:09:05: DM: You pass an alleyway and you swear you see a figure just standing there facing out of the alley towards you, not even long enough that you can tell they're staring at you, but you walk past this alley, you see a figure, and it's one of those things where you turn your head back because you actually notice it and there's nothing there.
0:09:25: DM: But like, weird kind of experience where you're like, huh, okay, keep walking, don't see, you look around, you don't see that figure, the thing rings a bell, but for a moment you swear, I saw somebody out of the corner of my eye.
0:09:41: DM: Next up we had, go ahead.
0:09:44: Kaliden: We switch,
0:10:06: DM: Afraid of what people would think when they see them. A figure always wearing cloaks and rags and for a long time was dead.
0:10:16: DM: Or at least they thought.
0:10:19: DM: They're not sure.
0:10:20: DM: Things are sort of muddy in their brain.
0:10:23: DM: They're not used to the skin that they wear, the heavy steps that they carry now.
0:10:30: DM: But currently, this figure just sort of sits slumped against the wall in a dark tunnel where you have arcane pipes overhead that just have a faint thrum and glow as like mana is directed from the well out towards the city.
0:10:47: DM: You have an occasional steam burst into the tunnel that just sort of puts a perpetual haze into the room.
0:10:55: DM: But as this figure sits there, their internal clock sort of whirs, and they come to realizing that it's probably 6.30 on the dot.
0:11:06: DM: Leopold, what would the people see if they were to look at you?
0:11:13: Leopold: Yeah, so if you'd peek through that dark corridor of this kind of misty, hazy hallway, you would just see kind of sitting, staring blankly at the wall in front of him, a large, you're not sure how tall, but you're clearly observing a large figure in clad in armor with just kind of an attempt to shield the face.  The helm of this armored knight is covered with two spiky horns and through the slit of the visor you see a violet glow of eyes. His arms are held together by whirling and ticking steam-powered instruments.
0:12:04: Leopold: You can kind of see the inner workings behind some of the plating.
0:12:09: Leopold: but he's just sitting totally oblivious.
0:12:14: Leopold: It's not sure how long he's even been there.
0:12:18: Leopold: Time gets weird when you spend so much time fully by yourself.
0:12:18: DM: Time gets weird when you spend so much time fully by yourself.
0:12:24: DM: It wasn't until you reckon maybe a year ago that you had regained consciousness.
0:12:31: DM: There was a time before that, a traumatic memory you don't focus on.
0:12:36: DM: where you truly feel like you woke up again, but something happened, you're not sure, a surge of power, a loss of consciousness, your form...
0:12:47: DM: you know, very metal-clad, was just deactivated for a bit. And it wasn't until our next figure, who at this moment is whistling to himself, carrying a pipe down the hall, just on his busy day work, he maintains this sort of underpassage of the core, making sure that there's no blown gaskets on the tubing, the pipes, making sure the mana flows directly.
0:13:13: DM: arcane runes that are etched into certain tablets he checks just to make sure that they need, like, to be reset by some sort of archonist or mage, that he can get that information to his employers.
0:13:27: DM: But currently, our next figure, Zariel, is heading in the direction of Leopold.
0:13:32: DM: Now, Zariel, as you walk down the hall, what does everybody else see?
0:13:38: Zariel: Well, you see a
0:13:41: Zariel: Lie on her feet.
0:13:44: Zariel: Roughly 5'10", maybe a bit shorter.
0:13:48: Zariel: Relatively skinny. Young man.
0:13:52: Zariel: Wearing a dark brown jacket.
0:13:56: Zariel: Work boots.
0:13:58: Zariel: Green piercing eyes. Oh, that was a shift right there. Basically, he's got a... Yeah, I know, it was throwing me.  He's just basically in his work clothes. He seems to be enjoying his work. He's not necessarily skipping his step per se, but he enjoys the habit, the ritual of going through and making sure everything is correct and working.
0:14:21: Zariel: If you look close enough, you'd see out of the front breast pocket, there is peeking out just a little flower.
0:14:34: Zariel: that he's got tucked with a little bit of napkin to keep it safe. Something that looks like maybe he found growing somewhere, and he's gonna try to maybe find a nice place to plant it. I love that.
0:14:49: DM: Is it Zerial or Zarial?
0:14:50: Zariel: Is it Zerial or Zarial?
0:14:55: Zariel: I was gonna say Zarial, but I mean, whatever works.
0:14:59: DM: Zarial.
0:15:00: DM: I just didn't know how to pronounce it. Didn't want to have it wrong.
0:15:04: DM: Zarya, as you head down the tunnel, the pipe on it, you sit down on like a rolling part that you have that you use to transport things here.
0:15:16: DM: You don't remember everything in your life, right?
0:15:20: DM: You were told that you had an accident, they found you in the under tunnels.
0:15:21: DM: Your head had been smashed in.
0:15:28: DM: Not sure why, but you went to this rehab program as they had fixed you up, bandaged you, you healed.
0:15:37: DM: You liked the work program. It was hard work, but you found that you've got great endurance for hard labor. You don't take it too hard. It doesn't wear you down. You sort of enjoyed the work and the busyness.
0:15:49: DM: And so you've just sort of been in this cycle for a long time.
0:15:56: DM: And this morning when you started your job, one of your other employees, we'll just call him Billy, you know, why not?
0:16:04: DM: Billy is a shorter man, stout frame, also a pretty good worker, fairly lazy when it comes to lifting the heavy stuff, because he knows he's got you around.
0:16:14: DM: But he had just mentioned to you, and he's like, well, shit.
0:16:18: DM: And he goes, Zario, why are you wasting your life out here?
0:16:22: DM: You have got potential. You see how strong you are compared to these other men?
0:16:28: DM: Shit.
0:16:29: DM: I bet you can make Legionnaire if you wanted and you see in this breaker and he just like points to the poster that says, you know, it's got those dumb corporate flyer that's like hiring from within. New, uh, new availabilities for each person, room to grow.
0:16:47: DM: pay increase, all these keywords getting you to apply for a different position within the corps.
0:16:54: DM: Something changed, and you were just like, sure.
0:16:58: DM: And better yet, you had this idea.
0:17:03: DM: You couldn't shake it. You felt almost a thrum in your chest that was, I should tell Leopold this.
0:17:13: DM: And then that's when we sort of come right back to the current moment.
0:17:17: DM: Whistling to yourself, you drop the pipe on the cart, and you've got this flyer in your hand as you head towards this, uh, like, automaton being that you had found in these tunnels and fixed up yourself, like, a year ago, where you finally got some power into his body, and he's sort of relit.
0:17:37: Zariel: Alright, yeah, I'll, uh, keep walking until I see Leo leaning against the wall, and, uh... They will.
0:17:47: Zariel: Leo, take a gander at this here flyer they got up.
0:17:49: Zariel: I couldn't help but notice they're looking for folks perhaps like you and me.
0:17:56: Zariel: I think we could actually do some real good, you know, better than just general upkeep.
0:18:06: Zariel: What do you say?
0:18:06: Leopold: What do you say?
0:18:08: Leopold: Leopold has been kind of left alone for so long in his past that he almost blankly blocks out his friend, Zariel, who resurrected him.
0:18:22: Leopold: And you just see his head tick a couple of times, almost in an unhuman way, and examine the file.
0:18:32: Leopold: And stand up and you can hear steam hissing out of his joints and bones.
0:18:38: Leopold: in front of you is a imposing six-foot-eleven, 450-pound suit of armor.
0:18:42: Leopold: And he just hangs down, and he picks Zariel up, and he goes, Zariel, I'm so happy to see you!
0:18:46: Leopold: And without any care for Zariel's well-being, he starts flinging him around, you know, clear that he has been completely deprived of attention.
0:19:04: Leopold: And he...
0:19:06: Leopold: I'm pretty well used to this.
0:19:10: Zariel: I can take a good bit of thrashing.
0:19:13: Zariel: I just see it as good male bonding.
0:19:14: Leopold: I just see it as good male bonding.
0:19:32: Zariel: Jeez, Leo, you still haven't been able to get that hat off yet.
0:19:33: Zariel: One of these days I'll have to grease you down and take turns yanking on it, because eventually you're going to have to shout.
0:19:51: Leopold: And I set him down, and I kind of go to dust him off, because I'm clear I've roughed him up a little bit. But honestly, the hands just come down.
0:20:00: Leopold: And they really kind of rough you up a little bit on accident.
0:20:05: Leopold: And he goes, oh, that's quite a nice flower you have there.
0:20:07: Leopold: And I'm going to do an investigation to see if I can determine what type of flower that is. 21.
0:20:22: DM: Put it on.
0:20:24: DM: This is a red-tipped orchid.
0:20:30: DM: Not super common. If you were to ask him, Zario would be able to tell you that he found it in the tunnel system.
0:20:41: DM: sort of heading towards the Emerald Grove. It's not uncommon to find, like, moss or grasses growing out of, like, little cracks in the ceiling as you sort of head that way, so everything's very overrun with plant life.
0:20:54: DM: But to find a blooming flower where he did is, you know, really caught his eye and is why he took it.
0:20:59: DM: Because you wouldn't expect to see a flower in the dark.
0:21:05: DM: But he didn't think of it necessarily like that. He just saw a pretty flower and he grabbed it.
0:21:10: Leopold: Yeah, so knowing all that, is there any kind of tells for the environment this grows in? Like, would I expect to find something nearby? You know, like, I don't know if I... To find this flower, you would expect sunlight and fresh air.
0:21:25: Leopold: Right, so underground is pretty unusual. Like, could I, would I be putting that together? It is pretty unusual, yeah.
0:21:33: Leopold: Would you be putting it together?
0:21:33: DM: Yeah, I think Leopold's pretty sharp.
0:21:35: Leopold: He's fairly well read. Yeah, he's pretty sharp. He's studied the botany tomes.
0:21:39: DM: Yeah, he's pretty sharp.
0:21:44: Leopold: But I'll lean down to Zariel and be like, oh, Zariel, that's quite the flower you have there.
0:21:45: Leopold: Where did you find that?
0:21:54: Leopold: Well, I was on my way from the Emerald Grove, and I happened to see a little bit of a pecan
0:21:54: Zariel: Well, I was on my way from the Emerald Grove, and I happened to see a little bit of a pecan
0:22:04: Zariel: color.
0:22:05: Zariel: You know, I don't generally see this type of thing down there.
0:22:07: Zariel: I took it as a bit of a sign. I was in a good mood, and our good mutual friend Billy, he pitched me this here flyer idea, and well, between that and the flower, and it's just been a good day, I figure, heck, do something for the good of the people.
0:22:28: Zariel: Who knows? Maybe we could be some help out there.
0:22:38: DM: Leopold, do you know this is a bad idea because robots don't really exist?
0:22:43: DM: In common... I dig?
0:22:49: DM: There's just something in your head that's like... Why not?
0:22:53: DM: Like, logically...
0:22:56: DM: You exist, and that's not... that's not wrong, right?
0:22:59: DM: Like, there's no reason you can't be a part of the Guard.
0:23:04: DM: You wouldn't even need armor for that.
0:23:22: Leopold: And I just kind of pat the wall, and a whole boulder shatters underneath my pat.
0:23:43: Zariel: Yeah, I'm pretty used to this sort of behavior. And I just say, well, I think you're being a little humble, Leo. And I tell you what, if you're wood, you're scared.
0:23:51: Zariel: I'll be there.
0:23:53: Zariel: Tell you what, it beats you watching me drink in the afternoon, all day, every other day.
0:23:59: Zariel: I will change it up.
0:24:02: Zariel: We're staking studies now.
0:24:19: Zariel: Sounds good, and I'll, uh, I'll grab his, like, little opening between where his, like, armor links together with his hand, and I'll kinda pull him in the direction to start walking, and then I'll put the little flower away, and we'll all just keep whistling as we head towards, uh, the testing area.
0:24:35: Zariel: Very good, love it.
0:24:39: Zariel: Leo is already sticking, which is great.
0:24:46: DM: Yeah, as you guys head down, well you at this point would be heading up just slightly, you're just going up the stairs through the various tunnels, making your way to, you know where this is, you know, it's easy for you, you've got this place mapped out. You're just going to like the training grounds is what it's formally called, but this is like where the tryouts are being held.
0:25:12: DM: uh uh and then do you guys make a stop anything on the way there or you just head there yeah um oh go ahead no you're first uh okay yeah i was just gonna say i'd like to uh
0:25:27: Zariel: Zair would like to go and swing by wherever his abode is, whether he's got a place on site in the core, like a little bunk he stays at while he's on shift. And I just like to put the flower somewhere safe, because I know I'm probably going to get a little physical.
0:25:39: Zariel: I just want to put it with my other little specimens that I find, just interesting little trinkets of nature, you know, just kind of set it aside, give it a little bit of water.
0:25:51: DM: They've got living quarters, so you've got like, think of it as like a quad studio apartment, like there's a shared kitchen and like four rooms just attached to each area, where it's like tight living quarters, but you do have your own space. So you head back to your house, where you maybe, well your room, not a house, it's your room, and you've got like a poster on the wall of the outdoors, and then you open your locker, and you've got like various things you collected, rocks, petals,
0:26:03: DM: You know, little shells that like somebody tracked in when they went to the Emerald Grove.
0:26:21: DM: You've got like maybe even like a crystal you found, something crazy cool like an arrowhead, something just neat. Like you've got weirdly valuable stuff just because you've got so much access to so much area, you find the most stuff.
0:26:34: DM: But this is, I would say, the first living thing you found.
0:26:40: Zariel: Yeah, it gets this special spot at the front, just where the tiny little window of the bathroom shared area, there's like a little glass thing that gets a little bit of sunlight outside, just peeks in, I set it right there.
0:26:47: Zariel: And then I give it a little pat, say, it's a big day.
0:26:58: Zariel: Big day, things are gonna change.
0:27:00: Zariel: And then I change out of my traditional like real work clothing into more of like,
0:27:07: Zariel: I imagine it as like a 30s fighting guy, like a pugilist outfit, just like a tight white shirt with suspenders and then work pants.
0:27:19: Zariel: And then I just kind of stretch a couple times, move a little bit, and then I meet up with Leo outside and head on down to the Legionnaire testing place.
0:27:33: Zariel: Love it. And then as we circle back, is Cal didn't want to do anything on his way in, or is he just heading there?
0:27:42: Kaliden: Um... No, I wouldn't have anything else to do, but... I probably think to myself, like... Okay, we must do this better.
0:28:05: Kaliden: Okay.
0:28:13: DM: You head down the tryouts, the combat arena is actually in the core itself.
0:28:18: DM: It's just like a huge, you know, vaulted warehouse ceiling arena built inside of another building kind of deal.
0:28:29: DM: And there's like lines of hundreds and thousands of people. It is packed.
0:28:34: DM: Everybody's in respective lines getting like little stickers and name tags and numbers on it for like a tryout number. The tryouts run for a couple days. So it's like a big event.
0:28:45: DM: There's a bunch of screening tests. There's like a strength, a wit, a con, a wisdom.
0:28:50: DM: There's like human relations and public talk. Like it's all these different things.
0:28:58: DM: uh that like sort of sorts you into what you're gonna be final testing for uh and like your best overall score will determine if you go one into the stonewall legionnaire and then two like you know it's not unheard of there are stories of like individuals who tested into like special forces equivalents right away you know like real impressive people as you guys wait in line uh
0:29:25: DM: Somebody just wrote me a D20 for a luck check on if you are in line together.
0:29:38: Leopold: Who's doing it? Jesse, you don't roll the dice that often.
0:29:38: Kaliden: Who's doing it?
0:29:40: Leopold: You roll it.
0:29:41: Zariel: You roll it.
0:29:46: Zariel: Yeah, I was going to say that. I'm always asking for them.
0:29:48: Leopold: I'm always asking for them.
0:30:09: DM: You are smart, you're pretty dexterous and strong, and you've got wit.
0:30:13: DM: You're pretty confident that if you did good, you're at least getting in.  if not being noticed really well, but as you walk in, it's not hard to miss.
0:30:23: DM: Everybody is staring at one of the most uncommon sites anybody sees in their life.
0:30:34: DM: You see a six 11, 400 something pounds metal man, except you don't see body parts necessarily.
0:30:43: DM: It's like,
0:30:49: DM: a glowing eyes coming out of a helmet like fucked in rags just towering over everybody else standing in line just waiting just you know hanging out having a good time that's that's like something that catches your mind your eye you're like holy shit that's my competition Zariole do you think we should uh do some maybe warm-ups or something i've never quite done anything like this before
0:31:19: Leopold: I'm just like yeah well I think that I'm just like kind of like standing on one foot balancing you know like trying to get my my feet underneath me
0:31:31: Zariel: Yeah, I'm used to trying to, like, make light of his ridiculousness and his giantness. So I'll just be like, yeah, well, I reckon that's a fantastic idea.
0:31:31: Leopold: Yeah, I'm used to trying to, like, make light of his ridiculousness and his giantness.
0:31:39: Zariel: Start doing some of these, swing your arm around.
0:31:45: Zariel: You know, one of these days, you know, you can just wear, like, normal clothes.
0:31:48: Zariel: You don't have to wear this big old... But, you know, anyways, it's fine.
0:31:53: Zariel: It's fine.
0:31:56: Zariel: You left your T-shirt at home, it happens.
0:31:56: Leopold: You left your T-shirt at home, it happens.
0:31:59: Leopold: I started loosening up by spinning my arm and it just starts accelerating to the point where it's like generating.
0:32:10: Leopold: Reach out to the center point and try to slow it down a little bit. Oh wow. I don't know if that would be a good idea.
0:32:18: Leopold: I think it's spinning quite fast.
0:32:21: DM: Eventually you all get your numbers, you know, uh,
0:32:25: DM: You're waiting, everybody's sorted in, and then finally, everybody gets sorted into their own groups. Why don't each of you roll me a d6 and we'll determine which testing round you go to first.
0:33:18: Zariel: Oh yes, as I'm walking by, I'm like, I couldn't help myself.
0:33:18: Kaliden: Oh yes, as I'm walking by, I'm like, I couldn't help myself. I've never seen what appears to not be human.
0:33:25: Kaliden: or a humanoid at all.
0:33:28: Leopold: Leopold is now just kind of squatting down. You just see his body perfectly squat down straight, and then you just hear this actuation of steam, and he just jumps up in the air quite a bit, just kind of doing vertical jumps.
0:33:48: Leopold: Go ahead and give me an acrobatics check.
0:33:54: Kaliden: Show us how impressive that gunk is.
0:33:57: Kaliden: Oh, it's very impressive.
0:34:01: DM: He jumps incredibly high and all you hear is like a... And he's arcane, he's not totally mechanic, but you hear gears winding up and grinding and then setting into very heavy positions and then just...
0:34:20: DM: The figure like burst off the ground into the air, like arms straight, legs straight, still clearing air, then hits the ground. The whole arena sort of shudders with his steps.
0:34:32: DM: And you, everybody can see, it's not a surprise, people notice. You see figures up in like a raised balcony look down and sort of point and make some side talk looking at you. But then, uh,
0:34:48: DM: Who rolled, what I see them now, on the five?
0:34:51: DM: Calvin and Mildew, you first.
0:34:53: DM: Your first test, as everybody gets separated, like it's basically like a festival. Think of it as like that busy. Everybody's getting tested individually because it's going to take too long to do semantically.
0:35:05: DM: This is not a quiet or private process.
0:35:05: Kaliden: This is not a quiet or private process. It's kind of loose. No. So, Keladin is heading to his own testing.
0:35:11: DM: No. So, Keladin is heading to his own testing. They're testing your wit at first. So, you just do a couple like, you know, not activity based things, but like, you know, they switch a ball around in a cup a bunch of times and have you pick which one it is.
0:35:29: DM: They do testing and smelling things. But overall,  as you're doing these tests, is there anything you wanna do to make yourself stand out?
0:35:37: DM: Otherwise, if not, just roll a wisdom check. And so what this is gonna be is, is you guys are gonna roll checks on each of the basic stats that determine where you fall.
0:35:52: DM: But if you do something to try to stand out, it can either work really well in your favor, or it can go horribly wrong, obviously.
0:35:59: DM: It's just sort of the thing
0:36:01: DM: you decide before your roll. So it'll be like, I want to just roll. And then if you do well enough overall, they notice you based off your score, you do something to stand out like Leopold did, then it like could be beneficial, but you might have attention for the wrong reason.
0:36:19: Kaliden: Cool.
0:36:21: Kaliden: I do this first one.
0:36:21: DM: I do this first one.
0:36:23: Kaliden: I'm just going to roll. Yeah. Do you either just make me wisdom check or do you want to try to stand out?
0:36:24: DM: Yeah. Do you either just make me wisdom check or do you want to try to stand out?
0:36:27: Kaliden: I'm going to just roll on this one.
0:36:37: DM: 13. You did pretty good. Above average. You're like 80th percentile of the grouping of the people who test, they tell you.
0:36:41: DM: Good potential as you move on. And then next up we'll do Leopold.
0:36:55: DM: Which section are you going to?
0:36:57: DM: Oh, this is a great one.
0:37:01: DM: They're doing like a body endurance test. They're trying to see how long you break.  but the tests aren't designed for something not human. And they have you like doing extended plank holds.
0:37:14: DM: And so you're just locked into a position holding it. So like you break the plank record.
0:37:20: DM: They have you do like a one leg balance as they like hit you in the stomach with like a kettlebell trying to throw you off.
0:37:29: DM: And it's just like bouncing and tinking.
0:37:32: DM: But go ahead and give me a constitution check.
0:37:36: Leopold: to see how you score overall. And I'm gonna try to impress him a bit.
0:37:37: DM: to see how you score overall.
0:37:42: Leopold: Okay, so instead tell me how you're gonna try to impress him.
0:37:42: DM: Okay, so instead tell me how you're gonna try to impress him.
0:37:46: Leopold: Yeah, so I'm balancing on one foot and they're just smacking me with metal pipes and the pipes are just wrapping around my body.
0:38:01: DM: Okay.
0:38:02: DM: Wrapping around your body, you're showing yourself to be really tough, and then when I conjure, you get 11. Your armor gets a little dented, but that's not what sticks out to people. You see, they're hitting you in the stomach with these pipes, and they're bending. Your torso gets dented. And then, like, as you're taking a break, people already were noticing you from your, like, stunt you pulled.
0:38:24: DM: And so everybody's just sort of watching it all the time and then what people notice with time is that the dense sort of self-correct, just over time you're like... It's like everything sort of pops back into place as apparently this mechanized being has the ability to rest and reset and heal on its own.
0:38:51: DM: Uh, not sure if that's good or bad, but 11 is not horrible.
0:38:55: DM: Uh, and then what did you get?
0:39:00: DM: Sorry, you got a 4.
0:39:04: DM: Okay.
0:39:05: DM: Uh, this is a great one for you. You are in a chess game.
0:39:10: DM: Dragon chess game.
0:39:12: DM: They've got you up pinned against the wall. You're sort of in a battle of like,
0:39:18: DM: strategy and determination. And as you have this chess game, they also have you playing like the equivalent of risk at the same time. So you're like being challenged to do all these things simultaneously as they talk with you and test you. Go ahead and give me an intelligence check or try to stand up.
0:39:37: Zariel: Hmm.
0:39:40: Zariel: Intelligence check wouldn't be fantastic.
0:39:44: Zariel: I think of what I could do to stand out. Are we level one as far as like stuff we can try to do? Or... Otherwise, not unless you try to... Standing out would be the equivalent.
0:39:59: DM: So let me know what you're trying to do and I'll let you know how it plays out.
0:40:05: Zariel: Well, I was thinking about trying to use a spell, but um...
0:40:11: Zariel: not necessarily for like the practical in-game effect, more of just like, I'm trying to, I was thinking I could try to use like fairy fire to like lay out like an area that I can focus on intensely and then it would like make the stuff pop up and easier to see so I could focus on more things moving at once.
0:40:24: Zariel: But I don't know if I have access to that or not.
0:40:38: DM: You can certainly try.
0:40:43: Zariel: All right, how do I try that? How do I try to cast that spell?
0:40:48: Zariel: Easy, it just happens. I just needed to know if that's something you wanted to do.
0:40:55: Zariel: Oh, no, go ahead and say what you gotta say.
0:40:59: Zariel: I was just gonna say, I think that his mind, his like,
0:41:03: Zariel: intelligence rational mind is starting to get a little overworked and so that kind of like more of like wisdom soul spiritual stuff starts to like well up and it just kind of emanates out of him and just kind of helps put things into focus as things are starting to get a little hectic.
0:41:25: DM: Yeah, it's almost akin to overstimulation. You're trying to focus on the strategies that are forcing you to. You feel like maybe it was the wrong test at first.
0:41:30: Zariel: You're trying to focus on the strategies that are forcing you to.
0:41:35: DM: You start hearing other people's conversations too much. You're focusing on the movement. You're like, can't help but keep looking at your peripheral vision.
0:41:44: DM: You start to hear your heartbeat in your chest, just a... And then it just continues to slow, just...
0:41:57: DM: And there's a moment of pause as all of a sudden you feel like something unlocks inside of you.
0:42:08: DM: And you open your eyes and you almost see like a purple outline, a haze sort of expand centering on you out and everything sort of gets lit up.
0:42:20: DM: Now it's up to you on whether or not this is visible.
0:42:26: DM: But something has happened and you've done something you've never done before.
0:42:30: DM: And you're sitting there and you get it.
0:42:34: DM: You have a plan mapped out in front of you. You execute the moves. You basically score 100th percentile in that test.
0:42:47: DM: But you can't help but notice that your test administrator starts taking some notes down.
0:42:55: DM: nothing super obvious in that you would like confront them about it but like as you're walking away with your score you look back and they're writing something down uh like taking notes diligently and then they take the next the next tester all right sweet let's kind of shake it off things that's a bit uh strange it's strange but oh yeah it was strange
0:43:21: DM: Kaladin, as you're going through these tests, is there any point in which you feel as though you would try to show off?
0:43:31: DM: Any test in particular in your head that you think Kaladin would go, okay, this is my chance to shine?
0:43:39: Kaliden: Yeah, it would probably be either a dexterity test.
0:43:49: Kaliden: or intelligence, probably.
0:43:53: Kaliden: Even though I've got a good modifier, I think that's where I would play my own strengths.
0:44:02: DM: Yeah, there is like a dueling tournament towards the end, so Kelly realizes, being a fairly smart individual,
0:44:13: DM: that, like, he's just gotta work his way through these initial testing phases, make it through, noticed or not, because you know that with your history of studying the sword, that, like, any sort of combat encounter is likely to go in your favor.
0:44:22: DM: So Kaladin is sort of prepping for the fight sequence, where they test, like, potential soldiers' actual ability in combat, opposed to these, like, sort of,
0:44:42: DM: wide cast net sort of strategies of just getting the best recruits out of thousands.
0:44:50: DM: So you do good. You just sort of power through and make it through.
0:44:53: DM: Leopold, back to you.
0:45:00: DM: Apparent or not, I'm setting everything up for like your character's sort of potential moments.
0:45:08: DM: Do you think Leopold would
0:45:12: DM: try to access something greater in initial testing, or do you think he'd only resort to something like that if he absolutely had to?
0:46:09: DM: Alright, cool.
0:46:11: DM: After a bunch of people are sort of filtered out, you know, the real trash and shitty people are just like, yeah, please leave, you're just embarrassing yourself, this was a money grab.
0:46:21: DM: Then like the true talents start to get noticed, there are like individual combat tests, and eventually he gets down to
0:46:36: DM: Like the final 10 and you three are a part of that in your like area.
0:46:38: DM: And this is where everything changes a little bit.
0:46:43: DM: It goes from being a bunch of just general test administrators to you see a figure step out of like the balcony area down the stairs, accompanied by a bunch of his own personal like soldiers all dressed similar to him.
0:47:01: DM: this figure he's got like a bucket like a 10 gallon hat on his head he's got like a nice done-up vest that's got a pocket watch on one side that hangs into another pocket on the other he doesn't wear like an overcoat or a trench coat so it's just a vest with a black shirt underneath but slung at his side you see like like beautifully impressive technology of like
0:47:30: DM: a bolt launcher, like a hand crossbow, but it's incredibly sleek and the arms that fire the bolts are really minimalist and not super noticeable.
0:47:38: DM: So it's like, it's the closest thing to like an evolving gun, but he's got one on his side and one sort of tucked underneath his armpit on the other side.
0:47:53: DM: And this figure sort of stands in front of the large crowd and rejects his voice. And he goes, now alright, you all listen up.
0:48:02: DM: This is the best day most of you will ever see, and that's just a fact I'm sorry to say.
0:48:09: DM: Welcome to your testing day, the tryouts.
0:48:14: DM: For our more astute attendees, you will have noticed that this year has a little bit different theme.
0:48:17: DM: We seem to be searching for something.
0:48:24: DM: No, I should introduce myself first.
0:48:27: DM: I am District Captain Levi.
0:48:31: DM: I will be overseeing any sort of recruits that get hired today, so it is in my best interest then to find the best, is it not? And he waits, just a beat, searching for a response.
0:48:49: DM: Yes, sir, is the correct response to you, Tall General.
0:48:53: DM: Yes, yes, sir, of course, of course, yes, sir. We'll keep you down for now. This is just a speech section, sir.
0:49:05: DM: This will differ in that you will be provided tools that you feel will best suit you in this combat.  Is that understood? And he sort of tilts his ear up as if he's waiting for you to say like something more akin to sir yes sir kind of deal?
0:49:26: Zariel: Yes sir. Yes.
0:49:27: DM: I love how enthusiastic this tall gentleman right here is.
0:49:31: DM: We'll split up into groups.
0:49:34: DM: Everybody go ahead and pair up with one other individual One caveat though. Mr. Eight-foot sir over there. I've got a special friend. I want you to play with And everybody sort of brings them into their own group Oh a special friend you say I'm quite excited to meet this good sir.
0:49:54: Leopold: Where is he?
0:49:55: DM: So you see like a bunch of like other like stonewall Legionnaire just like basic soldiers sort of usher you to your own fighting pit and
0:50:04: DM: And at the entrance of the pit, you see there are tables on either side of the steps into the pit itself. And they've got a different array of weaponry. There's swords, bows, axes.
0:50:14: DM: You've got maces and clubs, and then you've got tomes and arcane focuses. Different things that people would use for their own styles of combat.
0:50:29: DM: And they just sort of like free to pick what you think you're gonna be best suited for as you get ready When everybody gets ready for their fight, go ahead and let me know what you're picking And if something is there if you're not sure Are there any shields?
0:50:47: DM: Yeah shields are a part of like the Marshall set so there's gonna be a lot of shields I have a question with my current
0:50:57: Kaliden: clasp but my race does that allow me to pick up a longsword?
0:51:01: Kaliden: If you'd like, yeah.
0:51:05: Kaliden: I mean right I have a proficiency in that.
0:51:11: Kaliden: If I can use a long spear or a long sword could I use, could I mean a staff is something I can use, could I use a spear, would I be allowed to use a spear?
0:51:23: Kaliden: Spear is technically even just a simple weapon, so you can pick up a spear.
0:51:23: DM: Spear is technically even just a simple weapon, so you can pick up a spear. That's great.
0:51:26: Kaliden: So that still fits my current class and what I'm holding.
0:51:29: Kaliden: So yeah, I think I would pick up a spear.
0:51:35: DM: This is a pretty basic, like, you think like cedar handle, like not built to last kind of deal.
0:51:40: DM: It's just like, this is like the low grade testings that they just see for like one fight. If it breaks, who cares kind of deal.
0:51:49: DM: Uh, you pick up a normal looking sphere, you step into it. Uh, I want, uh, we're all four going to roll a d20.
0:51:56: DM: Uh, and then I'll just let you know what happens with the results. I'm trying to figure it out on the fly. I want to kind of do something fun with this.
0:52:11: Zariel: Uh,
0:52:22: Leopold: Yeah, you cut out there, Jesse.
0:52:25: Zariel: Sorry, I think I want a whip for my weapon, if they have it.
0:52:25: Leopold: Sorry, I think I want a whip for my weapon, if they have it.
0:52:31: Kaliden: Yeah, you can grab a whip.
0:52:39: Leopold: Um, Leopold is perusing all of these instruments of war and kind of thinking to himself how crude they all are. And, uh, just gets distracted reading a tome. And I think Levi notices him not pick a weapon and yells, you need a sword, son, and throws one up at me.
0:52:57: Leopold: And I kind of panic and grab a shield to block myself from that sword he threw at me.
0:53:04: Leopold: and it bounces off. It hits the ground and you're holding the shield and you hear a real deep bassy voice, not standing above you, behind you, but almost level with you.
0:53:05: DM: It hits the ground and you're holding the shield and you hear a real deep bassy voice, not standing above you, behind you, but almost level with you.
0:53:12: DM: You hear her nice, tiny, and you turn around and there's this enormous man, not quite six 11, but like six, nine, you know, three 50 just,
0:53:31: DM: putt of pure muscle this soldier who is like if you knew anything about the military you would recognize that his outfit's a little bit nicer he's obviously not a trainee he's already wearing like some form of stonewall engineer gear but he's just like in whatever pants it is and he's got just like a real tight tank top
0:53:53: DM: on his, like, upper body, and you see he picks up, like, spiked brass knuckles and he smacks them together and he goes, I hope you're ready for this one. Uh, and he's like, cause you were up against me.
0:54:02: DM: Oh my, is that you, Victor?
0:54:28: DM: All right, we'll get you in time.
0:54:29: DM: First up in the fighting order, we have, funny enough, tall guy right here.
0:54:38: DM: What is your name, son? I'm sorry.
0:54:42: DM: Is that your correct pronouns? Are you a son?
0:54:46: DM: Sir, what's... He gets close for the first time, and do you try to hide your appearance?
0:54:51: DM: Do you sort of shrink back, or if he gets close, is he seeing what you are? Uh, yeah, yeah.
0:54:53: Leopold: Do you sort of shrink back, or if he gets close, is he seeing what you are?
0:54:57: Leopold: He'll see me pretty up close. I'm fairly focused on the imposing brawler in front of me.
0:55:07: DM: He, like, sort of snaps in front of your face to get you going, and he's like, well, now, aren't you interesting?
0:55:07: Leopold: He, like, sort of snaps in front of your face to get you going, and he's like, well, now, aren't you interesting?
0:55:16: DM: I think there's something in you after all, ain't there? And he backs up and under his breath, he doesn't even try to hide it, he goes, this'll be a fun fight.
0:55:23: DM: And he looks at the other guy and he goes, Titan, I want you to push him, if you know what I mean.
0:55:29: DM: And you see Titan, the other fellow, just going, huh, you got it.
0:55:35: DM: You will be the first fight.
0:55:37: DM: I want you to go ahead and roll initiative.
0:55:40: DM: Okay.
0:55:45: Leopold: Well, could have been better.
0:56:00: DM: not the best you see uh you guys like back up to the the edge of your corners you sort of get ready you're like holding your shield a little precariously and for a second you lift it up over your eye line and then in a moment this massive man grabs up kicks the shield with you holding it and he flips it over his body and he's going to attempt to tackle you down with it uh
0:56:28: DM: With a natural 1, he misses. So he sort of flips up and he doesn't realize how heavy you are, and he just goes to pull the shield and he misses me.
0:56:37: DM: And he's gonna lift up the shield, he's gonna try to get a gut punch in at the same time.
0:56:42: DM: Does a 18 hit. Yeah, I don't have any armor on.
0:56:45: Leopold: Yup, that hits. Well I guess I have a shield, so it's plus 2. Yeah, still hits.
0:56:55: DM: punches you straight in what would be your ribs, but just sort of the lower plates of your armor. And then he kicks back and he sort of steps back in a second, uh, out of your range, funnily enough.
0:57:27: DM: As he kicks himself back, mechanically you would know that in theory you're supposed to get an attack of opportunity when somebody leaves your space, but for reasons not known to you or your character, he kicks back and there's no chance to attack him.
0:57:44: DM: He is much faster on his feet than you figured he was. It is now your turn to do something.
0:57:47: Leopold: It is now your turn to do something.
0:57:54: Leopold: Yeah.
0:57:56: Leopold: So Leopold is quite astonished.
0:58:00: Leopold: Oh dear, that really didn't feel good. I don't want to hurt you, but I wish you wouldn't do those kinds of things to me.
0:58:09: Leopold: And this little pipe shoots out of his wrist and just starts spraying oil all over the ground.
0:58:20: Leopold: I think you really should stay away from me. I don't really like it when you get all up close to me and he just starts squirting oil everywhere. And kind of turns around and hightails it.
0:58:33: DM: He's sure running.
0:58:36: Leopold: And then once he gets sufficiently far, let's see, what's the distance here?
0:58:47: Leopold: Uh, I'm gonna, yeah, I have 30 feet. I'm gonna grab, is this a torch?
0:58:54: DM: Uh, it's an arcane light. It's like just normal light bulb on the wall.
0:59:08: Leopold: And so, um,
0:59:15: Leopold: and when I actually run, I'm going to attempt to swing, is my shield, what's the quality of my shield, is it wood? It's wood, it's like wood with a metal frame, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty, it
0:59:57: Leopold: Yeah and the objective there is to light the grease on fire at my feet.
0:59:57: DM: Yeah and the objective there is to light the grease on fire at my feet.
1:00:04: Leopold: Go ahead and give me then just a nature attack.
1:00:17: DM: I'll say it starts to catch fire.
1:00:20: DM: It's not instantaneous, it didn't have this space in between the particles to instantly ignite and explode, but the greasy sludge catches on fire and puts an immediate barrier between you and this large figure. You see where the crowd goes, like everybody's cheering at this unexpected tactic to this fight.
1:00:48: Leopold: Okay. Yeah. And that's a 10 foot, 10 foot square centered, uh, like he, I put it right on the edge of his feet. So he would be standing underneath of it.
1:00:57: Leopold: That makes sense.
1:00:59: Leopold: Gotcha. Gotcha. You see, as you're doing that before you even have a chance to react, he's around the side and then he jumps up with lightning speed.
1:00:59: DM: Gotcha. Gotcha. You see, as you're doing that before you even have a chance to react, he's around the side and then he jumps up with lightning speed.
1:01:03: DM: You instantly realize in this moment,
1:01:14: DM: that you probably are not a match for this fighter. He comes down and he throws like a Muay Thai style elbow, where it's like forward into your face and he throws another one backwards.
1:01:23: DM: He's gonna attack you twice more. The first one is a 14 to hit.
1:01:35: Leopold: Meets it, beats it.
1:01:39: Leopold: Well, I guess, would he have to do a deck save?
1:01:43: Leopold: uh because of the grease uh he's just gonna take whatever damage it's gonna do or anything like that no terrain yeah difficult terrain class wise he ignores typical terrain when he moves there you go okay so
1:01:59: Leopold: It just says, when Grease appears, each creature standing in his area must succeed a dex throw, save, or fall prone.
1:01:59: DM: It just says, when Grease appears, each creature standing in his area must succeed a dex throw, save, or fall prone.
1:02:07: Leopold: Also mechanically, the reason why you couldn't attack him with an opportunity to attack is because he has the equivalent of mobile.
1:02:15: DM: Yeah, you instantly realize, and I do mean this
1:02:22: DM: As, like, harshly as it comes out, you are set up to fail in this fight. This guy is a skilled, seasoned veteran, and he is coming at you with, like, blood in his eyes kind of deal.
1:02:36: Leopold: Got it.
1:02:37: Leopold: Yeah, so, uh... Is that something that... Am I somewhere where I can see that, or am I off to do my own thing?
1:02:43: Zariel: Because I don't want them to kill my friend. You will be in your own fight.
1:02:43: DM: You will be in your own fight.
1:02:48: DM: You just haven't got there yet.
1:02:50: Zariel: Gotcha. No worries.
1:02:50: DM: No worries.
1:02:52: Zariel: I also, can I add that I imagine Leopold moving around like C-3PO because of his voice. I just see this giant metal. Weird movement like that. That's not too far off.
1:02:59: Leopold: Weird movement like that. That's not too far off.
1:03:06: Leopold: He is clearly not suited for his current form. He's very, very clumsy.
1:03:17: Leopold: Leopold, you take seven points of damage with these two strikes together.
1:03:24: DM: Is this a moment that you feel Leopold would try to instinctively react, or is he still trying to think logically?
1:03:35: Leopold: Yeah, so it's kind of two things in one. So the armor, I think, itself would react for self-preservation without much of control by Leo.
1:03:48: Leopold: So Leo's thinking,  How do I get out of this? And the armor, uh, I think kicks in and starts acting, uh, instinctively. Okay. But the, the armor is acting not Leo. Yeah. It's, it's taken over. It's it's realized this is a dire situation. Um, clearly it's, uh, it's going to perish and it needs to be something done.
1:03:57: DM: Okay. But the, the armor is acting not Leo. Yeah.
1:04:13: Leopold: Okay. Uh, you take that damage then, uh, your turn.
1:04:19: Leopold: Um... I am going to use... So it says, uh, for the Mending spell, I can physically repair or, uh, an item or a construct, so would that- that be effectively, like, healing myself?
1:04:36: Leopold: Uh, no, you are no longer considered a construct that way.
1:04:39: Leopold: Got it, okay. I will- You could repair your armor, but not, like, your hit points.
1:04:47: Leopold: Right, right.
1:04:56: Leopold: I will... So I've gotten knocked off my feet from his roundhouse kick or his power kick.
1:05:04: Leopold: And the armor just kind of kicks into gear and fires some jets of propulsion and I go shooting backwards without standing up.
1:05:21: Leopold: Away from my enemy.
1:05:23: Leopold: And, uh... He's gonna attack you on your way out.
1:05:27: Leopold: Oh, he was within a- okay.
1:05:28: Leopold: He's within 12. Yeah, he closed the distance on ya.
1:05:29: DM: Yeah, he closed the distance on ya. Uh, he- I don't think he gets within 9, though.
1:05:31: Leopold: Uh, he- I don't think he gets within 9, though.
1:05:35: Leopold: No, no, 9 doesn't hit. No, no, no, 12. You see, he goes down to stomp on you as you leave his space, and he just kicks up sand as you jet out of his way.
1:05:36: DM: You see, he goes down to stomp on you as you leave his space, and he just kicks up sand as you jet out of his way. Yeah, yep, so I'm gonna- I'm gonna basically get as far away as I can from him.
1:05:52: Leopold: And then, uh, the arena is just dirt?
1:05:56: Leopold: It's like sand, yeah.
1:06:04: Leopold: Oh dear.
1:06:11: Leopold: Are there any broken bricks or small pebbles or stones that have kind of...  fallen off of the arena or is it just sand and solid solid masonry?
1:06:23: DM: It's not even like that. You're like in a one foot lower down into the ground sand pit in like the middle of a combat arena.
1:06:32: DM: Options are pretty limited.
1:06:36: Leopold: And so I go scooting away on my butt, and I go, but Levi, Levi, I don't think this is really not a good idea for me.
1:06:52: Leopold: And yeah, with that, I'm going to end my turn there.
1:07:04: DM: Will Leo try to do something beyond what he considers in his grasp?
1:07:36: Leopold: Well, yeah, I mean, he's in full self-preservation mode. He's pretty much a big coward, so he's going to use whatever he can possibly manage to defend himself.
1:07:46: Leopold: But I think he imagines himself pretty much out of options. He's not known for his combat prowess.
1:07:56: DM: He does.
1:07:58: DM: what would be four points of damage to you, but you get to four free.
1:08:06: DM: As you're getting slammed, time almost seems to stop.
1:08:11: DM: You have flashes of memories you don't fully remember of a different body, a different time.
1:08:18: DM: None of the environment looks the same. You have flashes of just intense pain
1:08:45: DM: And as you hit the ground from this slam, you instinctively cast without spending a slot, and officially gaining your first level as an artificer, absorb elements, and you absorb
1:09:01: DM: all four points of that damage and you feel like a surge of power sitting just underneath your armor but as he lets you go and you stand up it's your turn and not only did you not take damage but you feel like this thrumming in your in your like dominant arm oh yeah that's cool uh i didn't know absorbed elements work for just like bludgeoning damage
1:09:26: DM: Not normally, but for flavor and fun.
1:09:26: Leopold: Not normally, but for flavor and fun. Right on, that's awesome. Yeah, I considered that, but I didn't think that was possible.
1:09:36: Leopold: Yeah, so absorbing the force of this attack and kind of harnessing it within my body, and I've suddenly realized that I have an ability that I didn't prior, I can actually deal some damage.
1:09:49: Leopold: So I will attempt to fire back that force I gathered at him.
1:09:57: DM: Yeah, go ahead and roll whatever, I don't think you have good unarmed strike.
1:09:57: Leopold: Yeah, go ahead and roll whatever, I don't think you have good unarmed strike.
1:10:05: DM: It'd just be 2 damage, so go ahead and roll 1d6 plus 2 on the damage of that.
1:10:12: Zariel: Okay. 6 damage.
1:10:20: Leopold: Great.
1:10:20: DM: As you strike into it, it's not invisible, which is what I think captures everybody's eye, but like he slams you down, you absorb all this energy and you turn around and you hit him in the gut as you close the distance and you see he physically launches backwards off his feet, fully not expecting this, but you see like an explosion of purple arcane power out of your fist and everybody goes,
1:10:21: Leopold: As you strike into it, it's not invisible, which is what I think captures everybody's eye, but like he slams you down, you absorb all this energy and you turn around and you hit him in the gut as you close the distance and you see he physically launches backwards off his feet, fully not expecting this, but you see like an explosion of purple arcane power out of your fist and everybody goes,
1:10:48: DM: and like looks at you because everybody knows what this is. This means anybody who can like display power like this is considered like almost certainly cursed, like you have the curse in your blood.
1:11:04: DM: But then I think it hits everybody else like, what?
1:11:07: DM: That doesn't make sense. He doesn't have blood. But everybody's just staring at you as you launch this big backwards.
1:11:15: DM: And then Captain Levi goes, whoa, that's wide enough right there. Why don't we get our little soldier here some rest?
1:11:20: DM: And you see a bunch of people sort of split the fight up at ends. And he goes, I knew I'd see something out of you.
1:11:28: DM: And then in that moment, we're going to cut to the next fight.
1:11:35: DM: And it's going to be between Zariel and you have a different encounter going on at the same time.
1:11:45: DM: You step into the table, and what was it that you grabbed?
1:11:49: DM: You grabbed a whip. That's right.
1:12:09: DM: So you step into the sandpit with your whip.
1:12:12: DM: You sort of
1:12:14: DM: Wrap it up, get it ready. Have you used the whip before, or is this Zario's first whip?
1:12:27: Zariel: Um, I just like to imagine, you know, that whole display in the war thing kind of threw him a little. Feeling this weird draw of different things.
1:12:38: Zariel: And so normally he went for the quarterstaff or maybe a spear. But something drew him to the wheel. He's going with his instincts today. He found the flower. Now he's just being whipped.
1:12:53: DM: All righty, standing across from you, you see a not an impressive looking figure, just a smaller soldier. He's got like his little spectacles like tightly fixed to his face and his weapon of choice, you see, he pulls out a tome.
1:13:15: Zariel: Well, I know he's a technologist, Paolo, but I got this here whipped, so I guess we'll see.
1:13:24: DM: And he's just like, yeah, your move, buckaroo.
1:13:35: Zariel: And so I guess I'll just say, well, good luck to you, son.
1:13:44: Zariel: And I'm going to take my whip, and I'm just going to kind of
1:13:48: Zariel: flip it out where it's not going to roll close to me. And you're just going to kind of give it a little shake, see how stiff it is.
1:13:51: Zariel: Step up to within five feet.
1:14:02: Zariel: So I'll get within five feet and I'll just try to whip him just like on the shoulder.
1:14:10: Zariel: You know, I don't want to hit him in the face or anything, you know.
1:14:21: Zariel: I feel a little awkward.
1:14:23: Zariel: I'll roll basically this.
1:14:36: Kaliden: Is that rolling?
1:14:36: Zariel: Is that rolling?
1:14:40: Kaliden: No, it's not.
1:14:40: Zariel: No, it's not.
1:14:45: Zariel: Oh, okay. There we go. Let's try that.
1:14:52: Zariel: Okay fine, I'm just going to roll a d20 and then add four. That's what it is on the sheet.
1:15:31: Zariel: Oh, um, here, I'll switch over to my phone.
1:15:34: DM: But 10, uh, doesn't hit plenty enough. You see this like little scrawny guy just like picks up his foot real quick as the whip like misses your target and goes low.
1:15:35: Zariel: You see this like little scrawny guy just like picks up his foot real quick as the whip like misses your target and goes low.
1:15:42: DM: He goes, Hey!
1:15:45: DM: And you see he like turns around and he throws a firebolt at you.
1:15:51: DM: Mrs. Wildly, and he's like panicking going through his book. He's like, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
1:15:59: DM: That is your movie again.
1:16:10: Kaliden: I wonder if he's a mid-switch.
1:16:13: Kaliden: Seems likely.
1:16:26: Zariel: Okay, I'm just gonna move to a better spot. Okay, alright, I heard you said that he missed me. So now is it my turn? Yep, you both have a 4 for showing, yeah.
1:16:35: DM: Yep, you both have a 4 for showing, yeah.
1:16:40: Zariel: I just kinda coughed a little bit.
1:16:40: DM: I just kinda coughed a little bit.
1:16:45: Zariel: Well, let's try this again. And I'm just gonna kinda move around.
1:16:51: Zariel: off to the side, and while I'm running over here, I just want to take another whip shot.
1:17:09: DM: And it, like, goes over his head, and it goes, like, really loud, and it sounds like it's gonna hurt if it hits him, but you're not making contact, and he's like,
1:17:20: DM: moving through his spellbook you can tell he's not good at this he maybe has like pretty low level magic ability uh he finds he lives on the same page and you see he throws another firebolt at you uh does 12 hit i don't think i have any armor uh oh 13
1:17:45: Zariel: So he misses. This is a great showing. Go ahead and hit roll to hit again on your next one.
1:17:46: DM: This is a great showing. Go ahead and hit roll to hit again on your next one.
1:17:52: Zariel: I might at some point try to do something different if this keeps not working.
1:17:58: Zariel: Oh!
1:17:59: Zariel: Natural 20.
1:18:00: DM: Natural 20.
1:18:01: DM: What's in Whip's damage?
1:18:05: Zariel: So I didn't really have a Whip pulled up, but I have the cantrip Thorn Whip.
1:18:05: DM: So I didn't really have a Whip pulled up, but I have the cantrip Thorn Whip.
1:18:15: Zariel: And I was gonna try to use that, and that's a d6 of force damage.
1:18:20: Zariel: Or, sorry, piercing damage. Um, and so I could just roll a d6.
1:18:27: Zariel: Okay.
1:18:30: Zariel: Let's see.
1:18:35: Zariel: Oh. Oh, it's a Crysta, so I could roll... Well, I guess... I already rolled one, so let's just do two.
1:18:43: Zariel: Roll, roll another one.
1:18:43: DM: Roll, roll another one.
1:18:44: Zariel: Okay.
1:18:46: DM: I was hoping it'd be enough to kill him in theory, but it's not.
1:18:50: DM: Seven.
1:18:51: DM: Oh, the duality of the rules.
1:18:55: DM: The duality of the limit.
1:18:59: DM: Interesting enough though, with the nat 20, you go to like whip him, and is this a moment, do you think, where Zariel is like pushing himself?
1:19:13: DM: So I think that, um, I'm feeling a bit embarrassed.
1:19:15: Zariel: You know, I had this really good start to the day, and the whip was, like, calling to me, and then I just whiffed twice, and then I'm starting to realize they stuck me with this nerd.
1:19:28: Zariel: And so I'm starting to get a little angry, and so I channel a little bit of extra oomph into this, and so I really, I really want it to work, and I'm starting to get a little emotional, and I think that's why I get the natural 20, is I just... Yeah, you reach out with the whip, and... It's not the whip that makes contact, in fact the whip misses again, but...
1:19:54: DM: when you do the motion like your fingers trail magic in the air in a whipping motion and a magic like whip manifests in the air and then like materializes full greenery and growth out of the ground and lashes out and grabs him and I think with the thorn whip you get to throw them too, right?
1:20:05: DM: You can move them a direction.
1:20:21: DM: So it wraps around this person's leg for a substantial amount of damage and then throws them 10 feet to the side and they go rolling down to the ground, very injured, but not dead.
1:20:32: DM: But this is another situation where everybody sort of stops and looks and is like, holy shit, did you just see that?
1:20:44: Zariel: Once the blood slows a little bit like, yeah, yeah, yeah, are you alright there, kid?
1:20:50: Zariel: He goes, fuck you, man!
1:20:52: DM: This is unfair, I get paired with some cursed fucker!
1:20:56: DM: And he throws another Firebolt at you. Oh, shit.
1:21:00: DM: Uh, 14 to hit this time.
1:21:03: Zariel: That does hit.
1:21:06: DM: Uh, that's 2 damage.
1:21:07: Zariel: Uh, that's 2 damage.
1:21:09: Zariel: Ooh, that smarts.
1:21:12: DM: I'll say, uh...
1:21:16: Zariel: Screw this! And now I'm gonna try to hit him again.
1:21:22: Zariel: Shoot me with your magic.
1:21:25: Zariel: Oh shi- Ugh, goth.
1:21:32: DM: That's where those four right at the end of the misses.
1:21:34: Kaliden: You whiff again.
1:21:34: DM: He only has the firebolt as an offensive spell.
1:21:41: DM: Natural one misses, your turn again. Nice.
1:21:43: Leopold: Nice.
1:21:46: Zariel: I'm gonna say, alright, now I missed on that last one because you bolted me in the arm, but this is it, say your goodbyes. And I'm just overhand, both hands, whippin' down, Indiana Jones style. 18.
1:21:46: DM: I'm gonna say, alright, now I missed on that last one because you bolted me in the arm, but this is it, say your goodbyes.
1:21:58: Zariel: Hits.
1:22:01: DM: No need to roll damage.
1:22:04: DM: You're not gonna kill this man, are you?
1:22:07: Zariel: No, no, no, I, I, I'm just, uh, my ego's a little hurt from missing five times out of six.
1:22:16: DM: your last one double overhand whip wraps around his neck and it pulls him up and just the force of being pulled by his neck not abrupt enough to like snap it just whips him unconscious as he goes flying 10 feet and hits like the edge of the arena just unconscious uh an insane deal you see uh leading him this time captain levi's guards uh are like
1:22:44: DM: to there to meet you instantly as it ends and he goes to say something to you at this exact same time.
1:22:47: DM: Kaladin is in his fight.
1:22:53: DM: Kaladin, you are going last and you have an interesting pairing as well.
1:23:03: DM: You haven't pushed yourself yet so there is no like eyes really on you but you were against this
1:23:12: DM: an ostentatiously posh nobleman, you don't know why he's even here, but he's dressed to the nines.
1:23:22: DM: Perfectly trimmed beard, hair in a nice little tuft, and he goes, ha ha!
1:23:29: DM: I would step forward.
1:23:43: DM: I respect only those at my level."
1:23:46: DM: And he looks at you, and when you look at him, you do see that this person looks more human than any other race, and it's like, at that point, you pick up, like, this guy is part of, like, a pretty high family, to have, like, a pretty high concentration of singular blood in his veins.
1:24:06: DM: And you see he looks you up and down, and he goes, well, you might indeed be my level.
1:24:12: DM: And he goes, haha, a battle for the century, I'm gone! And he pulls out a little rapier, and it's like really, really tiny and flimsy, but like, looks incredibly sharp, but it definitely wasn't on the table he brought this.
1:24:25: DM: Uh, go ahead and roll initiative.
1:24:32: Kaliden: Oh, poop.
1:24:35: Kaliden: He's got the first rank mecha one. It makes sense, he cuts you off guard.
1:24:35: DM: It makes sense, he cuts you off guard.
1:24:48: DM: He goes in with his rapier to attack you.
1:24:51: DM: He gets an eight.
1:24:53: Kaliden: It's a miss.
1:24:56: DM: Uh, and that's it.
1:24:57: DM: It's your turn.
1:25:07: Kaliden: Yeah.
1:25:11: Kaliden: I think being most interested now, like in,
1:25:17: Kaliden: But again, I want to like, I want to really impress people. And so obviously like, well, I'm not like quite my aiming buddies yet.
1:25:25: Kaliden: They don't have a lamb, but you do.
1:25:29: Kaliden: So I've got a lot of personal experience. And so I think I'm already starting to sort of like dive deep into some like inner self and channel some energy.
1:25:39: Kaliden: And I'm going to make a
1:25:45: Kaliden: an attack with my spear.
1:25:50: Kaliden: And I think I just want to cast Shocking Grasp right through the tip of the spear.
1:26:03: Kaliden: Doesn't 11 hit?
1:26:05: Kaliden: Bummer.
1:26:10: Kaliden: That's alright.
1:26:11: Kaliden: He's dancing around. Go ahead and roll to hit for the Shocking Grasp now.
1:26:16: DM: Oh yeah, go ahead and roll the hit for the spirit on that one instead. Like, you get to roll the hit for both in this situation.
1:26:19: Kaliden: Like, you get to roll the hit for both in this situation.
1:26:27: Kaliden: We're starting out cold.
1:26:31: DM: Full whiff. He sort of is more live than you experience, than you expected.
1:26:35: DM: I mean, he like dodges in on your attack and he's going to go to stab you again, but he's really close on this one. And this kind of feels like a dirty shot for like a fencer.
1:26:52: Kaliden: What's his hit? Are you rolling it?
1:26:56: Kaliden: I was going to, but it's being funky with it. So I'm just going to rock that.  Uh, that's a 10.
1:27:04: DM: Misses your turn again.
1:27:07: DM: You'd hope that the rolls would make for more exciting.
1:27:07: Kaliden: You'd hope that the rolls would make for more exciting.
1:27:10: Kaliden: It's ticked right out of the way. It's okay.
1:27:12: Kaliden: It's good.
1:27:13: Kaliden: Um, I think this time, I think having, having attempted that one time already, I would, I would do the exact same thing again.
1:27:20: Kaliden: I want to, I want to try to do a shopping graph through my spear again. Actually, you know what, this time, you know what?
1:27:29: Kaliden: I think just looking at him, I think I would back up five feet.
1:27:35: Kaliden: No, I don't want to, I don't need to obviously set that. I'll do, I'll do shock and grasp through the spear again. You want me to do the spear attack first?
1:27:44: Kaliden: Here we go.
1:27:52: Kaliden: And then the shock and grasp or don't do it because it was a miss.
1:27:57: DM: Go for the shock and grasp.
1:27:59: Kaliden: Okay.
1:28:01: Kaliden: There we go.
1:28:02: Kaliden: It's got a 21.
1:28:02: DM: Looking just for a hit really. Yeah. So the spear deflects off his armor and as it hits the ground, your determination to make something happen is, it's sort of swelling to the top.
1:28:02: Kaliden: Looking just for a hit really.
1:28:14: DM: As your spear hits the ground, you see like little tendrils of lightning, like grow off of each one.
1:28:26: DM: as, like, particles of sand explode outward. This dude is wearing, like, a metal breastplate.
1:28:33: DM: While it is form-fitted, he, like, just is an instant conductor for it, and the current shoots right into him, and he thinks he's safer, so you see he smirks again as he goes to pull another shot into you.
1:28:36: DM: He's basically just trying to shank you, and he doesn't go out cold, but he gets absolutely fried by this.
1:28:56: DM: And he backs up, he's like, what the fuck?
1:28:59: DM: And it's at this exact time you hear an explosion over from Leopold's pit as he punches this dude and sends him flying.
1:29:08: DM: And almost a split second later, you hear something come out of Zdariel's, uh, light arena as you see HE does something, but you can't make clear detail on it because you're in the middle of this fight, but
1:29:22: DM: Everybody's attention is getting pulled left and right and then back on you. He's going to go for one more attack. I'm going to say he's at a disadvantage because he just lost such a huge amount of his HP.
1:29:34: DM: He misses with a 7.
1:29:39: DM: Your turn to make something happen.
1:29:51: Kaliden: Yeah, I think having gotten now excited with getting a hit and seeing his weakness, I think I would just slam the butt of the staff on the ground.
1:30:03: Kaliden: And as I did that, I would just say again, out of respect, and I would just hit the ground and I'll cast Thunder Wave.
1:30:11: Kaliden: Nice.
1:30:14: Kaliden: Good damage for us. Why did I not do the...
1:30:17: Kaliden: Oh, it's just a concept, sorry. Well, it's a save, so yeah. I'm going to say, no save necessary.
1:30:19: DM: Well, it's a save, so yeah. I'm going to say, no save necessary.
1:30:25: DM: It's the intent that matters with this.
1:30:29: DM: You verbalize that it's not malice you're after.  you you speak into existence that you were just have some respect your voice rings out and we'll say like half of the arcane light bulbs blow out in that second people are thrown to their feet this guy is sent flying out of the arena out of your pit into another pit ass over tea kettle goes flying
1:30:58: DM: as you slam it down and like, we'll say the majority of the sand in your pit is like evacuated. You were standing on like the stone of the floor and everybody doesn't make a sound, but everybody stares at you.
1:31:07: DM: Go ahead and give me a perception check in that moment.
1:31:51: DM: Gotcha. As you, your positioning makes a lot of sense too. You're looking up into sort of this, like,
1:32:00: DM: raised balcony up here that you saw Captain Levi descend from before.
1:32:05: DM: When you do this level of like arcane explosion, just like a truly higher level spell than most people ever see in Cast, you see up in that corner in like a dark area lit by like the embers of his pipe, a figure is very closely watching you.
1:32:28: DM: Some people lean in and whisper, this figure sort of waves off and doesn't break eye contact. And you see Captain Levi is watching this figure as well, gives a nod, looks to you and has you escorted to the other two figures who have sort of made a pretty good scene.
1:32:49: DM: You guys aren't brought in chains necessarily, but you get the sense
1:32:54: DM: Uh, when you were brought together, like, tensions are kind of high here. You're not totally sure. As you're brought together, do you guys say anything to each other as you're sort of rounded up?
1:33:09: Zariel: Can I see, like, does Leopold look, like, just jacked up?
1:33:13: Zariel: He looks...
1:33:15: DM: He did, but you can tell, like, as I stated before, through his mending cantrip, which basically is free cast anytime he's got a free action, his armor is, like, slowly undenting itself.
1:33:33: Zariel: I'll just give him a pat. Not something you've seen before.
1:33:34: DM: Not something you've seen before. I'll give him a pat on the back plate, and I'll just be like,
1:33:40: Zariel: Must have done, uh, pretty good. How are you feeling, Leo?
1:33:59: Leopold: He threw me around like a toy, and then I didn't quite mean to do it, but I blasted him with some kind of force.
1:34:10: Leopold: This is quite traumatic. I am not cut out for this fighting stuff.
1:34:15: Zariel: Oh, don't sell yourself too short. I think you're pretty great. Sounds better than mine. They paired me up with this little pipsqueak, and I just whipped him until he was unconscious. I'm starting to feel a little bad about it. You whipped him?
1:34:36: Zariel: Yeah, well, it sounds... Oh, dear.
1:34:40: Zariel: It sounds bad. Uh, it's not that bad. Don't look at me like that with those weird red eyes.
1:34:45: Zariel: I'm sorry, I'm getting defensive. I don't know about this, Zariel.
1:34:55: Zariel: Well, he was trying to shoot me, uh, first, uh, as well, but yeah.
1:35:01: Leopold: Well, yes, I guess indeed, self-defense.
1:35:05: Zariel: Yeah, a whip is just not a very, like,  heroic weapon. It just seems very mean-spirited.
1:35:09: Leopold: heroic weapon. It just seems very mean-spirited.
1:35:18: Leopold: Yes, indeed. I was whipped once, you know, as a young boy. It's not pleasant.
1:35:25: Zariel: Yeah, yeah. What about you, Mr. Tresemme?
1:35:26: Leopold: What about you, Mr. Tresemme?
1:35:31: Zariel: You seem like you must have done well, too.
1:35:36: Kaliden: Yes, I did quite well, very much.
1:35:36: Zariel: Yes, I did quite well, very much.
1:35:40: Kaliden: You two are being escorted, too. You must have done well.
1:35:43: Kaliden: My name is Kaladin.
1:35:46: Zariel: Kaladin?
1:35:49: Zariel: Pleased to meet you. Ariel? This here is my friend Leopold Magnus.
1:35:55: Kaliden: Yeah, I could not miss this. I saw him on the way in. It is nothing like I've ever seen.
1:35:56: Leopold: I saw him on the way in.
1:36:01: Leopold: Real pleasure to meet you, sir.
1:36:03: Leopold: Can I extend out my automatic arm for a shot?
1:36:06: Leopold: Yeah.
1:36:06: Kaliden: Yeah.
1:36:07: Kaliden: I'll very slowly extend mine.
1:36:10: Kaliden: The pleasure is all mine.
1:36:12: Leopold: The hand just kind of seizes and collapses around yours. And then I start to shake violently up and down the arm is very quickly up and down. Yeah.
1:36:29: Kaliden: So are we being, are we being led towards the dark figure that we saw or just to a different area?
1:36:36: Kaliden: I just made note that someone was watching us.
1:36:40: DM: They're like up and removed. They're just sort of watching the whole thing. From this distance, you know that there's no way you're going to tell who this is. This is just like a person fully in the dark.
1:36:41: Kaliden: They're like up and removed.
1:36:42: Kaliden: They're just sort of watching the whole thing.
1:36:49: DM: You only could tell them they were there because they like took a puff on their pipe when you looked up at them.
1:37:00: Zariel: Could I, while we're like being led by the people around us, could I just
1:37:07: Zariel: take a look at their faces and try to get a gist from their body language about whether or not, I mean, obviously there's tensions, but whether or not there might be something more malicious than just that we did something unexpected.
1:37:22: Zariel: Give me an insight check.
1:37:24: Zariel: Okay.
1:37:26: Zariel: Just kind of an odd... Anybody who wants to make a check can give an insight check as well.
1:37:38: Leopold: Well, that's another natural 20.
1:37:46: DM: Number two.
1:38:01: DM: Zario, you don't know how you know.
1:38:06: DM: But that heartbeat, that... rings out again, and you can tell there's something going on in your body, but you didn't realize it until you sort of look at Kaladin, you see what he was capable of doing, and then it sort of just clicks into place, and you're like, they're kind of screaming for potential super soldiers, like,
1:38:37: DM: You aren't- people aren't in awe because, like, they're about ready to pounce and stab you to death because you're witches.
1:38:44: DM: People are looking at you like that because they're like, holy shit, I'm within a hundred feet of somebody who might someday be able to, like, punch a building down kind of deal.
1:38:53: DM: Like, to be- to carry the esophic curse isn't necessarily a death sentence.
1:39:03: DM: Like,
1:39:04: DM: people turn into monsters, you have this curse that's well-known, which is why people are hesitant of it, but people also, like, unleash, like, unobtainable potential that, like, is almost always locked off from the general populace with, like, the ability it grants them to channel natural, like, magic and mana.
1:39:26: DM: So you're, like, just sort of surveying the room for the first time, and you
1:39:30: DM: realize you are now MVPs of history. Like everybody's looking at you because they're like, so what's next?
1:39:42: Zariel: Well, while I'm noting this, I'll say that I imagine I'm hearing more nervous chatter from Leo, and I'll just put a hand out on one of his pauldrons. Just like, it's alright, Leo. I think, uh...
1:39:57: Zariel: I think we've shown everything we need to, I think. Things are going to be looking up from here. It's going to be all flowers for us.
1:40:06: Leopold: Why indeed? I sure hope so, because that was quite, quite traumatic for me.
1:40:13: Leopold: If it's anything like that, is it red wing-tipped orchid was the flower?
1:40:15: Leopold: I think I said red-tipped orchid.
1:40:22: Leopold: If it's anything like that, red-tipped orchid in your breast pocket today, we're off  We're off to see quite an adventure, I'd say. You know, those flowers don't grow commonly down in the Underdark.
1:40:36: Leopold: Indeed.
1:40:41: DM: Yeah, you guys are, you have this like moment and you feel connected.
1:40:49: DM: Like you share a common heritage almost in this moment.  And you are all officially level one, and go ahead and take a long rest, and gain the benefits of leveling up to level two as well.
1:41:08: DM: And as you do that, there's going to be a little bit of narration before we get into the final bit of tonight.
1:41:13: DM: But Captain Levi walks up and he goes, now I didn't want to spoil the fun anyway, but it's just not every day you have three individuals
1:41:24: DM: blessed with the Esoptic Curse.
1:41:27: DM: Now, it's fairly rare, I do admit myself, I do have some abilities granted by a similar curse, you could say.
1:41:36: DM: Luckily, I didn't turn into a threat of any kind.
1:41:40: DM: Most of the most powerful soldiers in Legion are cursed to some extent.
1:41:45: DM: I will say I've never seen power drop like you, sir, as he points.
1:41:51: DM: First at Kaladin,
1:41:53: DM: then at Zariel and then lands on Leopold and he stays on Leopold and he goes, you are an interesting figure. Has anybody ever told you that?
1:42:08: Leopold: And, um, yes, uh, I didn't see him very often, but, um, I have heard it once or twice, you know, I'm quite the, quite the academic.
1:42:10: Leopold: So folks think I'm fairly intriguing to talk to. Yes.
1:42:24: Leopold: Alright then.
1:42:33: Zariel: Well, he's more of the uh book smart but he's got a good heart.
1:42:38: Zariel: Well, uh he's he's he's he's he's he's a good he's a good person. Alright, I'll bet you're the
1:42:45: DM: Alright, I'll bet you're the
1:42:51: DM: Peter in the Bush right here. What do you think about this scenario, Lord Marshal Thurr?
1:42:56: DM: And he looks up at the figure who was like cloaked in the shadow before and you see a bear of a man.
1:43:02: DM: He's got thick, muscular, hairy arms, a deep head and a full black beard that sort of hides most of his face.
1:43:16: DM: He carries like a long cob pipe hanging out of his mouth, partially lit, and he carries a huge scar over his right eyeball that sort of leaves it in discoloration like it doesn't quite work as well anymore. He has a high and tight haircut that starts sort of dark and fades to gray at certain portions.
1:43:39: DM: Lord Marshall Thurr is a very famous man in the city. He's like,
1:43:45: DM: Famous for being a soldier who made it to, like, one of the highest ranks.
1:43:50: DM: Not coming from money, he's like a battle-tested, he's fought more monsters and creatures than anybody else combined kind of guy. Real man of the people.
1:44:01: DM: And as he stands and leans on the railing, he goes, I have to agree with my, uh, comrade here.
1:44:10: DM: No beating around the bush. We screamed today because we were looking for
1:44:17: DM: You three have shown this potential.
1:44:21: DM: I'd like to offer you a seat among our ranks as legionnaire soldiers, and I don't just mean this as general propaganda, with opportunity to move up quickly.
1:44:37: DM: What say you?
1:44:49: Zariel: I'll turn towards Leo and I'll give him a little elbow nudge. I'll kind of tilt my head to be like, what do you think?
1:44:56: Zariel: You know?
1:45:07: DM: After what I've seen today, I think the skill set is there.
1:45:11: DM: Tiny man.
1:45:21: DM: I love... Okay, I'm going to go to the southern because of Jesse's character. I love the enthusiasm.
1:45:29: DM: Obviously, without the paperwork, you would have time to move with your things.
1:45:35: DM: But to settle matters first, everybody else, I thank you for making it this far. Tryouts have hereby concluded.  I found what I had been looking for in my drinks.
1:45:48: DM: See you next year, perhaps."
1:45:50: DM: And the noble who had been beat by Kaladin, he's sort of still recovering from his fight, slunk in the corner, gets up and he's, "...No!
1:46:01: DM: This absolutely can't be the case!
1:46:03: DM: I demand a recount!"
1:46:05: DM: as he storms around. "...Yes, a recount! Vote on who should be sent through!"
1:46:14: DM: And Lord Marshal Thorgo goes, I'm not interested in any recounts.
1:46:19: DM: We'll see you next year. I promise you, you have potential as well.
1:46:24: DM: And this noble goes, you're damn right I have potential.
1:46:25: DM: You think they're the only ones who are cursed?
1:46:30: DM: And he goes, well, I'll show you.
1:46:33: DM: And he goes, you think he's going to cast a spell? And then he freaks out because his entire hand catches on fire.  And he starts just screaming in agony and pain as the fire spreads from his hand to his forearm.
1:46:48: DM: It encompasses his entire body. His screams suffocate as he leans his air and then he ignites into this enormous flame monster.
1:47:00: DM: And you see the Lord Marshal Thurr turn in shock.
1:47:05: DM: And he goes, guards!
1:47:07: DM: You three!
1:47:08: DM: Do me! And he jumps down to join the fight. I'd like you all to roll initiative one more time.
1:47:16: Kaliden: Hey Jonathan, so I was at 16, and now I roll a 1d6, is that right?
1:47:22: DM: Yes, 1d6, and it'll automatically odd your con modifier, so just add the d6 to the rolled number, don't worry about adding any other math to it.
1:47:31: Kaliden: Right, there's no way to roll automatic, I just need to roll it on the table.
1:47:37: Kaliden: Just roll it on the table, in person, or on the app.
1:47:39: Leopold: So it's what do we say, it's plus your con modifier?
1:47:43: DM: Well, it's whatever your hit die is. His is a six, yours, Artemis, might be six, and it might be eight.
1:47:55: Leopold: Let me tell you, just a second.
1:47:58: Leopold: And then we did level to 2, right?
1:48:01: Leopold: You have D8s.
1:48:02: Leopold: So you roll a D8. Yes, you're at level 2 now.
1:48:02: DM: So you roll a D8. Yes, you're at level 2 now. I got a 5 right there on the board.
1:48:03: Kaliden: I got a 5 right there on the board.
1:48:06: DM: And you instantly feel refreshed as this monster emerges. There's a surge of pressure and power. You feel the air is heavier. It is something your body is like picking up on.
1:48:07: Kaliden: And you instantly feel refreshed as this monster emerges.
1:48:11: Kaliden: There's a surge of pressure and power.
1:48:19: DM: And in the thrill of the fight, you guys feel like a surge of power and energy come to you.
1:48:31: Zariel: Nice, look at that. All right.
1:49:05: Zariel: Okay, there we go.
1:49:24: Leopold: So my hit dice is, so I'd only roll a 1d8, right? 1d8 and add it to whatever your total is.
1:49:32: Leopold: Okay. But there's no like constitution. Uh, no, it automatically does it based off of your stats.
1:49:39: Leopold: Oh, I might figure that out later. I guess I'll just sleep.
1:49:45: DM: Like you were constitutions of plus three. So whatever you roll on your DA, you add it to roll and hit dice and it'll automatically throw in the plus three.
1:49:47: Leopold: So whatever you roll on your DA, you add it to roll and hit dice and it'll automatically throw in the plus three.
1:49:58: Zariel: So I got a quick question. So when I open up my sheet here with the space bar, it only gives me like the top left corner.
1:50:04: Zariel: Good job, sir. You might need to reload the page.
1:50:10: Zariel: I'll try that. OK. Did you see that 8 I got on the hit points?
1:50:19: Zariel: I did. I'm pretty excited about that.
1:50:24: Zariel: Let's try that now.
1:50:26: Zariel: I still didn't see anything. Okay, it's fine.
1:50:40: Zariel: Well, that's a plus two, so I'll just roll it over here for initiative.
1:50:54: Kaliden: I'm going to use this intermediate mod for this guy.
1:51:16: DM: Okay, so I believe the order will be Zariel, Kaladin, Leopold.
1:51:40: Zariel: So I feel this burst of power and being so unsuccessful with the whip, I feel the kind of almost animal desire to just
1:51:54: Zariel: attack with my hands, but I'm gonna sprint towards this guy, and I'm gonna get out in front of Leo, and as I close the gap, you're gonna see this burst of arcane energy, I guess it'd be more nature-based energy, shift my form into that of a dire wolf, and I'm going to use my wild shape
1:52:24: Zariel: and change it to a dire wolf.
1:52:27: Zariel: And I've got the stats over on a different page.
1:52:32: Zariel: But I should have prepped this better.
1:52:36: Zariel: Yeah, so it has to be a CR1. And when I do that, I'm going to make an attack.
1:52:47: Zariel: It's plus five to hit on a target.
1:52:50: Zariel: And is this considered a creature?
1:52:55: Zariel: Or is it a monster?
1:52:57: Zariel: It is an elemental, but it is a monster. Okay, gotcha.
1:53:10: Zariel: So that's gonna be... A 20 to hit on my bite attack?
1:53:21: Zariel: All right, so it's... let me just get it here. 2d6 plus 3 piercing damage.
1:53:29: Zariel: So I'll roll that.
1:53:34: Zariel: So it's gonna be 9 piercing damage as the Dire Wolf runs out and just... bites.
1:53:44: Kaliden: 9 damage... All righty, you take...
1:53:51: DM: Two points of damage for being close to it, as this creature just is blitzing heat into the space around you.
1:54:01: DM: Singes your fur a little bit.
1:54:05: DM: Gotcha.
1:54:06: Zariel: Anything else on your crew?
1:54:06: DM: Anything else on your crew?
1:54:08: Zariel: Bonus, action, movement, I'll just say Eldritch Blast. No, I won't say anything.
1:54:21: Zariel: All righty, off we go.
1:54:26: DM: This Cursed Fire Elemental, it is going to unleash on the closest thing to Zariel.
1:54:43: Zariel: It gets two attacks.
1:54:46: Zariel: AC 14 for the wolf.
1:54:48: DM: First one is an 18 plus 6, so 24. Second one is a dirty spawner.
1:54:51: Kaliden: Second one is a dirty spawner.
1:54:57: DM: Oh yeah.
1:55:00: DM: And you take a 7 damage, 7 fire damage.
1:55:07: DM: And since you are a creature, you ignite on fire. So until you take the action to douse the fire, you take 1d10 fire damage at the start of each of your turns.
1:55:18: DM: But actively, he won Empire.
1:55:21: DM: Kaladin was your turn.
1:55:26: Kaliden: Uh, yeah, I think I'll... I'll shift to the side a little bit here.
1:55:38: Kaliden: And then... He hit the elemental.
1:55:43: Kaliden: Is that what he did? He bit? Or what did you do, KC?
1:55:47: Zariel: Yeah, I just ran up, turned into a wolf, and bit it right in the center of my ass, and so now my whole mouth and head and face is on fire. Toasty.
1:55:58: Kaliden: Uh, I'm gonna cast Chromatic Orb.
1:56:03: Kaliden: I'm gonna make a water damage.
1:56:08: Kaliden: It's not gonna hit.
1:56:18: Kaliden: Alright.
1:56:20: Kaliden: Oops, I need to roll that again. I don't know why it auto-rolls the damage on that cast.
1:56:23: Kaliden: Bummer, because it didn't hit.
1:56:31: Kaliden: Anything else?
1:56:33: Kaliden: Well, I don't need bonus actions yet.
1:56:37: DM: Okay, next up is Lord Marshal Thurr.
1:56:38: DM: He points at you, Leopold, and he goes, I want to see what you can do in this fight, but I'm not concerned. And he will point to you and he will use a battle maneuver and have you attack as a reaction. So go ahead and take your turn early.
1:56:55: Leopold: Oh, cool.
1:56:58: Leopold: Um, so I'm going to cast, uh, Fire Fairy and I'm going to place it, um,
1:56:59: Leopold: right over the elemental.
1:57:12: Leopold: I know you meant Faerie Fire, but I do really like that you said Fire Faerie first, because it fits Fire Elemental. Yeah, Faerie Fire.
1:57:12: DM: I know you meant Faerie Fire, but I do really like that you said Fire Faerie first, because it fits Fire Elemental.
1:57:22: DM: It is ignited. I think it just works, unless there's a save or anything. So, for the duration, I believe it sheds enlighten everybody who attacks it has advantage, correct?
1:57:35: Leopold: 20 foot cube, any creature in the area is outlined in light if it fails a dex save. So, dex save is what it needs to... Dex save out of... Elemental.
1:57:50: Leopold: 6 plus 3, 9. Ooh, fails. Nice.
1:57:51: DM: 6 plus 3, 9.
1:57:55: Leopold: It is covered in a different kind of light.
1:57:59: DM: Makes it a little bit easier to hit Viridiana.
1:58:02: Leopold: Makes it a little bit easier to hit Viridiana.
1:58:06: Leopold: And I'll scream out, uh, Azariola, he should be easier to hit now. I recommend not biting him.
1:58:17: DM: It's quite powerful. It's your actual turn now.
1:58:17: Leopold: It's quite powerful.
1:58:21: Leopold: Oh, I thought it... Oh, oh, now I get a second... Oh, weird. Okay. Yeah, so she on his turn lets you take a free turn, essentially.
1:58:25: DM: Yeah, so she on his turn lets you take a free turn, essentially. Oh, interesting.
1:58:29: Leopold: Okay.
1:58:32: Leopold: Um...
1:58:43: Leopold: Still no stones around, huh?
1:58:47: Leopold: You can find something at this point if you'd like. Okay.
1:58:50: Leopold: You're not in your little sand pit. Got it, excellent. Yeah, I'm looking around for a few magic stones, or a few stones that I could imbue with magic.
1:58:50: DM: You're not in your little sand pit.
1:59:00: Leopold: And, um... Yeah, you find some, just like, you walk over and you go to, like, grab a brick that's in the wall, but then your hand just goes through the wall and you pick up the brick anyway.
1:59:12: Leopold: Excellent.
1:59:13: Leopold: And I will imbue those bits of brick with some magic energy using magic stone. And I'm gonna do three pebbles.
1:59:23: Leopold: And then, can I throw all three at once or is that just a one at a time?
1:59:30: Leopold: Magic stone.
1:59:41: Leopold: With one of the pebbles. I think you do one at a time. Right, yep. I will do that. With one of the pebbles, yeah.
2:00:01: Leopold: I don't know why you would choose to make one instead of three when you can, but anyways. I will throw a magic stone at this fire golem.
2:00:14: Leopold: Go ahead and roll to hit. 15 to hit.
2:00:18: Leopold: 15 does hit.
2:00:20: Leopold: Excellent.
2:00:23: Leopold: You will take six damage from that stone.
2:00:33: Leopold: That was my action, and I don't have a bonus action, so that was my turn.
2:00:40: DM: Nice next up. Zaro, you are up next. Before your turn at the end, as Leopold, you do your thing, you're using magic to imbue things. The Lord Marshal goes, interesting, I pegged you more for a fighter with your stature, but all skills are beneficial skills.
2:00:40: Leopold: Zaro, you are up next.
2:00:44: Leopold: Before your turn at the end, as Leopold, you do your thing, you're using magic to imbue things.
2:01:00: DM: Doggy it is your turn.
2:01:04: Zariel: I do love the visual of the giant metal knight, just like nervously looking around and throwing rocks.
2:01:10: DM: He's like C-3PO meets Baymax from Big Hero 6, like he's just an awkward but gentle giant.
2:01:18: Zariel: Yeah, I love it, it's great.
2:01:22: Zariel: Say whale. I can do one thing pretty whale. So I'm gonna take another bite.
2:01:33: Zariel: So we'll do, uh... How do you do it with advantage in the chat?
2:01:38: Kaliden: You can right-click, uh, right-click the attack and you have that. You have a thing to do with advantage. Yep. I'm gonna roll a double for ya.
2:01:42: Zariel: You have a thing to do with advantage.
2:02:05: Zariel: Alright, well that wasn't with advantage, it just did it once, I'm not sure why.
2:02:05: Zariel: It did, it just only showed you the highest roll, which is kind of interesting.
2:02:18: Kaliden: It said keep highest, so 17 is what you should.
2:02:22: Zariel: Dumb. Okay, I'm just being dumb. Alright, so 17, so yeah, I'll take another bite. So that's gonna be 2d6 plus 3. And so I'll roll that real quick.
2:02:38: Zariel: That's gonna be, uh, 10 piercing damage. Is that just taken out of chain?
2:02:44: Zariel: No.
2:02:48: DM: Now this Fire Ansemoto is looking praised. It is screaming, like, just if fire could scream, that is what you are, Matt. It's like a high-pitched whistle as it, like, opens its mouth and thrashes.
2:02:48: Zariel: Now this Fire Ansemoto is looking praised.
2:02:58: DM: It's looking hurt, but it's, like, actively catching the, like, training area on fire.
2:03:09: DM: Oh, but it's looking hurt.
2:03:10: DM: On its turn, you see it's going to make one attack on you and one attack on the Lord Marshal. Uh, it has a... Don't criticize all my d10.
2:03:15: Zariel: Uh, it has a... Don't criticize all my d10.
2:03:18: Zariel: Because I didn't use my self-heal.
2:03:24: DM: Oh, you take 9 damage.
2:03:28: DM: Ooh, yeah.
2:03:31: DM: It also, I believe, what is its bonus?
2:03:43: Zariel: Oh yeah, it's a plus 6.
2:03:43: DM: So 17 hits you, it rolled a 25 to hit the Lord Marshal, which hits, and both of you take a d10 of fire damage for being in its proximity.
2:03:56: DM: You take 10 damage because of the fire damage as well.
2:04:03: Zariel: Ow.
2:04:05: Zariel: This wolf looks really messed up.
2:04:11: DM: And then actual damage on you.
2:04:11: Zariel: And then actual damage on you.
2:04:16: DM: You take 9 fire damage from the strike, and Lord Marshall takes 8 damage from the strike.
2:04:26: Zariel: That exactly bumps me out of wolf form.
2:04:30: DM: You drop out of wolf form, but back into your normal form, correct?
2:04:30: Zariel: You drop out of wolf form, but back into your normal form, correct?
2:04:36: Zariel: Yeah.
2:04:40: Zariel: Would I still be on fire? No, I'm going to say, as the wolf fully ignites fighting through the entire thing, it basically just burns away like flash paper, and your form is underneath, ready to continue the fight, unscathed from that damage.
2:04:43: DM: It's almost like an outer shell you fought through. It is Kaladin's turn.
2:05:10: Kaliden: Oh, I'll do the exact same thing again with a little bit more focus. Oh yeah, with Vanish.
2:05:27: Kaliden: Not quite. 14. 14 hits.
2:05:31: Zariel: Nice.
2:05:34: DM: And it has water susceptibility, so go ahead and roll double damage.
2:05:35: Kaliden: And it has water susceptibility, so go ahead and roll double damage.
2:05:42: DM: Wanted damage. It is so hurt, but it is not dead yet.
2:05:45: DM: In this moment, this is something I'm going to introduce throughout the campaign.
2:05:48: DM: I'm not going to explain it.
2:05:54: DM: It's one of those things where you're going to just have to say yes or no.
2:05:59: DM: Does Kaladin push for a little extra damage?
2:06:07: Kaliden: Yeah, spearing this rush of power for the first time, not knowing what it is, I think I'll let that maybe... I'll tap a little too far, or let it overtake me a little bit.
2:06:18: Kaliden: I don't think there'll be any consequences later on.
2:06:21: Zariel: No, never ever. Never ever.
2:06:23: Kaliden: No, never ever. Never ever. This curse will never end.
2:06:25: DM: This curse will never end.
2:06:28: DM: Mark one stress point.
2:06:31: Kaliden: One stress point, okay.
2:06:34: Zariel: I love that.
2:06:44: DM: Describe how you and your chromatic orb of water destroys this elemental in fashion.
2:06:55: DM: Um, I think I would, I was using all three components to cast that one.
2:07:07: Kaliden: Yes.
2:07:09: Kaliden: Uh, I would be, I would be doing all of my regular motions and like preparing for the spell.
2:07:11: Kaliden: And I think I would just point the staff when I was having to spear.
2:07:22: Kaliden: I'll point the spear at right at the fire elemental now or this, whatever this being is that burns into flames.
2:07:29: Kaliden: And I would think I would probably say.
2:07:49: DM: You say, we're not on my level and the orb starts spinning with increased, increased speeds. You see like, uh, tales of magic sort of manifest into the air and sort of
2:08:00: DM: almost like Vitamix blender, where you see it sort of circle towards the center, and when it makes the connection, it seems to speed up and get pulled in much faster.
2:08:15: DM: And as you gather this power, your hands start shaking, the ground starts shaking, you unleash this torrent of concentrated liquid that doesn't just make this fire elemental extinguish and get doused, but tunnels a partial hole into the wall
2:08:34: DM: where it, like, hits behind it, leaving just, like, this faint humanoid-type form with, like, hands stretched out where the Elemental was, and then just nothing.
2:09:00: DM: Uh, after this...
2:09:04: DM: Everything settles for a second, and you hear the Lord Marshal goes, I'm happy I didn't have to step in.
2:09:13: DM: You were all capable fighters.
2:09:18: DM: I would have meant I didn't have my eye particularly on you, young man.
2:09:22: DM: And he looks at you, Kaladin.
2:09:26: DM: But I appreciate the showman you've offered today.
2:09:32: DM: The offer still stands.
2:09:34: DM: for you to join our forces.
2:09:37: DM: This is the threats you will face somewhat regularly if you join.
2:09:52: Kaliden: I want to be trained better.
2:10:05: Leopold: I'm still a little apprehensive. That fellow was not kind to me or my friends here, but I think we're stronger together if we all team up.
2:10:18: Zariel: Yes, I have to say that I would agree. Are the lodgings provided? Or let my inferiors
2:10:31: DM: sorts that out. Then you see he just sort of three-quarter squats, and without very much, like, effort at all, he jumps back up into the balcony above, barely disturbing the sand below him, and walks back into the cover and into the doors and disappears.
2:10:48: DM: Standing under the cover where he was, just casually relaxing as if he wasn't really all that worried, Captain Levi goes, well now, how about this?
2:10:59: DM: I like what I saw, y'all. The Lord Marshal likes what he saw, y'all. I will give you three days to make a decision.
2:11:07: DM: Three days, you report back to my company. We'll move on with our new training regiments. I'll lay out the plan for y'all.
2:11:15: DM: If you don't, don't show up.
2:11:17: DM: I don't care.
2:11:19: DM: If you wish to move into the Legion facilities,
2:11:25: DM: I only ask that you do it within those three days, that way it doesn't affect your work life.
2:11:32: DM: Between now and then, I also would like to have you meet up with a smithy.
2:11:38: DM: We like to call her Last Ham Hawk.
2:11:40: DM: She's over there in the Storm District.
2:11:43: DM: Tell her Captain Levi Sanchez will get you hooked up with standard gear, whatever weapons you feel like you want to specialize in.
2:11:47: DM: She'll hook you up real nice.
2:11:52: DM: Any questions?
2:11:57: Leopold: Yes, do you have a library at the at the Legionnaires accommodations?
2:12:07: DM: Yeah, once we get you through a proper tour if you choose to report back Come see me.
2:12:17: DM: We'll get you hooked up with the learned stuff if you will any other questions that
2:12:31: DM: Alrighty.
2:12:33: DM: Welcome to the Legionnaires.
2:12:36: DM: Dismissed, soldiers. He turns around and he walks up the stairs. He doesn't jump or anything fancy like that. He just disappears into the stairwell. You can tell he's going up to the balcony and then into the same door that the Lord Marshal disappeared behind.
2:12:52: DM: Leaving you three in this open arena, void of any other fighters, void of any other threats,
2:13:01: DM: A new party, forming or unforming, we'll see.
2:13:05: DM: We're gonna end it right there for tonight. About 11, I think it's a good time.
2:13:13: DM: We can work out ironing other backstory ideas in the meantime, but I like where that started.
2:13:20: DM: Yeah.
2:13:25: Leopold: That was good. That was a lot of fun.
2:13:31: Leopold: Rex, your character is fun. I enjoy it. I had to pick something almost polar opposite of Maharb.
2:13:42: Leopold: Had a little fun with it, yeah, for sure.
2:13:47: Zariel: I like that you made him so big and scary.
2:13:47: Leopold: I like that you made him so big and scary.
2:13:50: Zariel: I think that was a good choice. Yeah.
2:13:50: Leopold: I think that was a good choice. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
2:13:54: Leopold: Maybe we'll get to the specifics about how he ended up in there, but I think you guys will get a kick out of it.
2:14:03: Leopold: Nice.
2:14:04: DM: In normal Rex fashion, it's unexpectedly dark for how it turned out.
2:14:15: Leopold: Yeah, that was a lot of fun. This is cool.
2:14:19: Leopold: And I can't wait to finish off the other campaign when we get a chance to meet up in person.
2:14:24: Kaliden: Yeah, I was going to say, Loretta and I were talking about that earlier.
2:14:28: Kaliden: Was there a weekend for July that looks good for
2:14:32: Kaliden: Uh, I think. Yeah, go ahead, Jesse.
2:14:32: Zariel: Yeah, go ahead, Jesse.
2:14:35: Zariel: I was just thinking, I think we decided the weekend after the 4th would be the best.
2:14:40: Leopold: All right, yeah.
2:14:41: Kaliden: I'm cool with that.
2:14:42: Leopold: That Saturday, the 6th. Oh, the 13th.
2:14:44: Kaliden: Oh, the 13th.
2:14:48: Leopold: Yeah, so I need to, I think Megan and I had a concert in Portland that week.
2:14:52: Leopold: It's either that weekend or the following. Let me double check.
2:14:59: Leopold: Hey, let us know.
2:14:59: DM: Hey, let us know.
2:15:01: DM: I think that'll be the only conflicting plan. I'm good for that.
2:15:03: Zariel: I'm good for that.
2:15:06: DM: Yeah, I think that was kind of a tentative.
2:15:09: Leopold: Okay.
2:15:09: Kaliden: Yeah, the 13th's okay with me, so check on that.
2:15:09: Zariel: Yeah, the 13th's okay with me, so check on that.
2:15:13: Leopold: Yeah, that is, I just looked. It is that weekend. No problem.
2:15:18: Leopold: Did anybody roll a natural during that?
2:15:18: Kaliden: Did anybody roll a natural during that?
2:15:22: Leopold: What's that?
2:15:24: Kaliden: During this session, any natural ones? I rolled two. I rolled one natural one.
2:15:27: Kaliden: I don't think I rolled any.
2:15:31: Zariel: I rolled two natural 20s. Yeah.
2:15:33: Kaliden: Could you guys do the 20th? Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
2:15:33: Zariel: Could you guys do the 20th? Yeah. Yeah.
2:15:37: Kaliden: Um, I can even do
2:15:49: Zariel: um a sunday instead of saturday if we wanted to do uh the weekend before that but i mean if you're in portland on that saturday you probably don't want to drive all the way back on the very next you know everyone at concert late and i'm not exactly sure when we'll be back um yeah but yeah if the 20th works for everyone
2:16:13: Leopold: Yeah, well then let's just tentatively shoot for that and then go from there.
2:16:16: Leopold: Cool, I'm putting it on the calendar.
2:16:18: Leopold: And then... We good for a normal session Wednesday then?
2:16:23: Leopold: Sounds good to me. Yeah, I'm free Wednesdays going forward, unless I have a kickball game and I'll let you guys know, but generally they're earlier. This was one of the earlier ones.
2:16:33: Leopold: Next Wednesday's the third, everybody's good with that?
2:16:33: Kaliden: Next Wednesday's the third, everybody's good with that?
2:16:37: Leopold: Yep, I'm not headed out of town or anything.
2:16:40: Leopold: Should be fine for me.
2:16:40: Kaliden: Should be fine for me.
2:16:42: Kaliden: All right. Yeah, let's go. Let's do this. That's a con.
2:16:42: Leopold: Yeah, let's go. Let's do this.
2:16:46: Zariel: Awesome. Thanks guys. I like this a lot.
2:16:46: DM: Awesome.
2:16:46: Kaliden: Thanks guys.
2:16:47: DM: I like this a lot.
2:16:50: DM: Welcome to VRS and welcome to being curved.
2:16:53: Kaliden: Are we going to learn the mechanics behind the stress point eventually?
2:16:59: Kaliden: Nah. Okay. Maybe we'll figure it out as we go.
2:17:01: Leopold: Maybe we'll figure it out as we go.
2:17:04: Leopold: You could just do that for free as many times as you want. Definitely no repercussions.
2:17:04: Kaliden: You could just do that for free as many times as you want.
2:17:08: Leopold: None at all.
2:17:08: Zariel: None at all.
2:17:10: Zariel: You know, I was also thinking we should have talked about this beforehand, and all of us should have just chose to not ever push it, and then just went and got normal jobs, like being a banker or something.
2:17:19: Kaliden: Actually, you know what? I just feel like being really safe with this. I was gonna say, Rex, there was a time where I was trying to talk with you, and you would, like, step away or something, and I was like, do you want to push it or not?
2:17:23: DM: And you were silent, and I was like, I have a feeling his character is gonna sort of resist
2:17:37: DM: Fighting aggressively and anything he's do he does is going to be on the defense So I had looked at your character sheet ahead of time and then like I think I'm gonna pull an absorb elements Yeah, no that that's that's pretty sick.
2:17:47: Leopold: I I was thinking I wanted to do that But I was like damn this guy's hitting you bludgeoning or you know, it's just like there's no elements to it. No, this is I should all this is a little more out of the way now so I'm feel free talking this campaigns gonna break some rules a little bit just because I
2:18:06: DM: I want to play around with like important moments having more weight than other moments.
2:18:12: DM: So like there will be chances for you guys to do like damage with a cock.
2:18:19: DM: There will be, there's like the, like I said, the going on a heater mechanic I was working on.
2:18:20: DM: There's going to be situations where you can like, as you know, the curse sort of is impacted by your intentions, your actions.
2:18:36: DM: and like what you do. So if you guys have to do something bad, there's a chance there's going to be like physical changes to your persons as a result of it kind of deal.
2:18:48: Kaliden: Yeah.
2:18:56: DM: Like it goes both ways.
2:18:56: Leopold: Like it goes both ways.
2:18:58: Leopold: Yeah.
2:18:58: DM: Yeah. I mean, this guy turned into a fire demon, so clearly.
2:19:03: DM: Yeah, you don't know what he'd done previously, but that was enough to change it.
2:19:03: Leopold: Yeah, you don't know what he'd done previously, but that was enough to change it. Yeah.
2:19:08: Leopold: No, that's awesome. That's, uh, that's fun. I love the homebrew.
2:19:15: Leopold: I love you guys.
2:19:18: Leopold: Cool. All right. Well, uh, we'll see you guys next week and then, um, plan on doing the 20th in person.
2:19:25: Kaliden: Yeah. You guys available for any distance weekend?
2:19:25: Leopold: You guys available for any distance weekend?
2:19:30: Leopold: Uh, you know, this weekend I'm out on my sister's wedding, but I'm, I'm in town, uh, next week over the 4th of July. So like, I'd be down if you're, if you're one.
2:19:42: Kaliden: Cool.
2:19:43: Kaliden: I know I've got Thursday, Friday off of work, so we could definitely find some common time in there.
2:19:49: Kaliden: All right.
2:19:53: Zariel: Take it easy. Have a good night. Yeah, you too.

Leopold Magnus 00:00:00 Yep, really fucks.
Cyrus Schwert 00:00:01 It does fuck. It's so hard.
Dungeon Master 00:00:02 What to start with. What to start with? That's the question.
Kaladen Shash 00:00:02 Oh.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:29 Oh, nice. Yeah, you guys, you did some character AI stuff. That's sick.
Cyrus Schwert 00:00:44 Yeah, a new profile picture for the boy. An imagey for sure. Edge Lord. Yeah, it's my choker, dude. I didn't give it that many things to put on me. It did get that.
Dungeon Master 00:00:47 Buddha.
Cletus Cobbington 00:00:51 You're so edgy, Cyrus. The choker, I love the chow.
Kaladen Shash 00:00:59 It's on there. I love that I showed up. It's red.
Cletus Cobbington 00:01:13 Even though I don't picture myself as just a full-on cow, I just am so in love with the one Jesse made it so good. The glass of milk is so nice. It's so good.
Zariel Torgan 00:01:25 I was really happy with that turn. Yeah. That turned out really good. Yeah, I was pretty happy with it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:01:26 Let me have business. Let me have business.
Cyrus Schwert 00:01:27 Good last milk and I have got almonds.
Leopold Magnus 00:01:27 Yeah, man, that cracks me up. Oh my God. It's like the live action version, you know. That's great.
Kaladen Shash 00:01:29 It's really.
Cletus Cobbington 00:01:41 My buddy, I was on Discord with him, he goes, why is your profile a picture of a cow guy? Like, don't worry about it.
Leopold Magnus 00:01:57 Yeah, that's a good idea. I should change my Discord.
Zariel Torgan 00:01:58 I was going to a project called Westwood. So there's not what we really tell us.
Dungeon Master 00:02:13 All right, a Spotify link was posted. So, um, last we left off, you guys had just defeated the elder brain. You, um,
Cletus Cobbington 00:02:16 I'm hearing listening, don't worry.
Cyrus Schwert 00:02:17 Man, a little creepy.
Dungeon Master 00:02:33 gathered the remaining members of this sort of animal folk adventuring party in major way via different bird styles to the small settlement of Cottonwood. Quallan Cottonwood, taken by the beauty of the simple crick, enchanted houses, all these animal folk sort of gawking at your alien forms. You were eventually led to an old sort of tortal shaman named Bernelia, an elderly stuttering.
Cyrus Schwert 00:02:48 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:03:03 a cleric of some sort who offered you some services if you were to help them as they've been recently being besieged by this praised group of knolls and lizard folk in name of some deity on the mountain.
Dungeon Master 00:03:22 You were offered some amount of gold slash gemstones for each ear of the knolls you brought. And when you made your way to the mountain, you started by taking all the ears of the cobalds in record hand in. And we ended right as you guys had finished off. So you are ascending the sort of volcanic mountain pass. We left off with everybody having finished this. We didn't get any further.
Kaladen Shash 00:03:35 It's
Dungeon Master 00:03:51 So as you guys catch your breath, the heat sort of radiating off the rock at all time is getting pretty intense. You're getting uncomfortable at this point, but do you guys have space to go wherever you'd like?
Leopold Magnus 00:04:14 Well, Cyrus, that choker really suits you. You gotta keep it? Yes, it looks quite uncomfortable to breathe, to be honest, but I didn't want to say anything.
Cyrus Schwert 00:04:15 Yeah, it's a little tight. I sensed it really tight. I sensed it really tight. I know. I mean, it could be worse, I suppose. The worst thing is being choked to death.
Kaladen Shash 00:04:22 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 00:04:37 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:04:39 Yeah, you could have it like that guy rat shit and do some serious damage to your soft tissues. Oh, oh dear. Well, you and rat shit have more in common than you'd think.
Cyrus Schwert 00:04:48 I actually have very soft tissues as well. Believe it or not. Like my soft tissues are like really soft. Tell me about it.
Kaladen Shash 00:05:06 It sounds the same as the old. Yes, old stuff, yes, yes. Does, is there like a, is there like a clear view of where we're heading or is this path just winding around a corner? Is he not on? Okay. Okay. Okay. I mean, yes, let us continue, right? Keep pushing for it.
Dungeon Master 00:05:17 We're drifting at this point. It's just winding. It kind of maybe a hundred or so feet up sort of disappears around a bend and you can't see the rest of it. Yeah, what happened to Jesse?
Leopold Magnus 00:05:36 Well, I suppose. But it seems like Zario is getting left behind over there. Right.
Cletus Cobbington 00:05:43 I have a question for the group, I guess. Did we actually notice that we picked up the wrong kind of ears yet? OK.
Cyrus Schwert 00:05:43 What's the internet?
Kaladen Shash 00:05:44 We can wait for a moment. Because the internet is ass. He said so. No, no, no. I mean, only only if we listened to the instructions from the previous session. We talked about that way we were playing disc golf. We were like, yeah, we got all those ears. And then I was like, yeah, they were all cobalds. Darn it.
Dungeon Master 00:05:50 You know.
Leopold Magnus 00:06:09 Yeah. Yeah. No, we just brutalized the cobalds just for the hell of it. That's her calling card now. We are called the Odeers. We'll just call her, oh, dears, the O'ears, yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:06:13 What were we supposed to get the ears of? Cyrus? That's true. I think Cyrus would...
Cletus Cobbington 00:06:17 Whoever walks this path after us is just going to be horrified. The, we're now the note years. That's the rename after Cyrus and Cleod is joined.
Dungeon Master 00:06:20 No ears, the odiers? This is horrible, you know?
Kaladen Shash 00:06:22 Earless, steerless lizard men just laying around. It's played it.
Leopold Magnus 00:06:38 Maybe that could be the rumor. Yeah. On the years. Jeez.
Cyrus Schwert 00:06:42 That's horrible, a horrible calling card. Cyrus updates his hinge profile to have like when people catch fish and hold it up, you know, just like with a bunch of covaldeers. This is gonna get me hell of babes. Yeah, how many hits do I have on hinge?
Dungeon Master 00:07:01 Yeah, see you back. Yeah, go ahead. Roll forehand. You get 19 matches. A lot of them seem fake.
Cletus Cobbington 00:07:03 Can Cyrus roll to see if that hinge actually makes him get some dates? Holy fuck.
Kaladen Shash 00:07:05 You're muted, Jesse, if you can hear it. Oh, he's out. He's up. He's up.
Cyrus Schwert 00:07:12 I got an 18. The red one. Oh, my God. I'm like literally drowning in it right now. Some of them are bots, but some are probably real. The hinge exists and I get hell of pussy.
Leopold Magnus 00:07:19 Oh, wow. Damn. There's a lot of cobald haters in this world. Is that what we're making canon? But 90% of them are bots?
Kaladen Shash 00:07:35 Oh, my God. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Cyrus Schwert 00:07:41 Yeah. I get so much virtual tale. I got hella war forged in my mentions.
Cletus Cobbington 00:07:46 And only after you... It's your robot helper. He's just... When he's being repaired, he scrolls hinge. Yeah, bone crusher. Yeah, bone crusher.
Dungeon Master 00:07:47 Some of them are just a profile picture of Leopold, so like an actual robot. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:07:55 Yeah, yeah, they're not robots per se. I got it, yeah, that's great. Yeah, I did make him a tablet the other day at camp, so, you know, so you could scroll.
Kaladen Shash 00:08:11 Oh.
Cyrus Schwert 00:08:14 But unhinged, oh, dear. He's an iPad kid. It's got hash going along in the corner. Got it. Perfect. Does he needs Starlink.
Cletus Cobbington 00:08:20 We should have, it's writing bitches and letters. Hell yeah. So, so efficient.
Leopold Magnus 00:08:25 No, no, it's like a slate. It's a slate tablet. Yeah, it's a slate tablet for his messages, yeah. Writes him in stone and passes them out. And Jesse is struggling right now.
Cyrus Schwert 00:08:48 He needs to get hooked up with Starlink. That was a lot of damage. God damn.
Dungeon Master 00:08:49 Star Lake went to shit after Elon became president. Yeah. He was fine. Drove down the street.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:53 Alright, can you hear me? Jesus Christ. Yeah, that was that was ridiculous. I moved location, so I should be decent on the, on the internet now. So feeling good.
Leopold Magnus 00:08:55 God bless America.
Kaladen Shash 00:08:56 Yeah, there he is.
Cletus Cobbington 00:09:09 You went to your third mansion instead?
Zariel Torgan 00:09:15 No, I actually, I hooked up a second Starlink here at the resort, and I think I might have too much stuff on the one, so it's slowing everything down. So I'm on the other one now, though, so it should be okay.
Dungeon Master 00:09:24 All righty. You guys, I don't know how much Jesse heard or didn't hear. You have a brief moment in between that you can tell, no other noise that's anything that you see. There's not any danger in the immediate future. So as Caledon had sort of asked,
Leopold Magnus 00:09:29 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:09:52 about how far up could you see it's like 80 to 100 feet and then so gradually goes around the corner of this volcanic area so um what would you guys like to do
Leopold Magnus 00:10:03 I guess first off, Zaryl, did you catch the cannon about the cobald ears while you were gone? Yeah, OK, cool. I just wanted to make sure you got that while you're in and out. Cool.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:09 Was it that we got them, even though we didn't really even need them? Yeah. I think that was brought up, like, right before we got off last time. He's like, oh, yes, so just so you guys know. Those weren't. Uh, no. No. Yeah. Colbolts are like the... Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:10:24 Okay, maybe that ones. Knowles. We're just going to, we're just going to, let's just turn them all in. We already got some ears. We're just going for quantity, guys. Rack them up. Rack them up.
Cyrus Schwert 00:10:26 What kind of ears are we supposed to be getting? Right. If we fuck them up enough, we could probably sell them as in old years. Mangle them. He's wise, dude. He's wise.
Cletus Cobbington 00:10:29 Knowles. We need hyena ears. I mean, he's old as fuck. He's an old-ass turtle. What are the odds he mistakes some of these ears? That doesn't mean he's not blind.
Dungeon Master 00:10:37 experience.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:38 Just grab all the ears that we can get. Okay, now that we've got somebody with charisma, we need to just gaslight this, turtle.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:54 Yeah. Oh, Zario, you should just hand them to your hounds. They'll chew up on them and look a little bit gross. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:10:57 He's wise beyond his ears and he's 400. We probably walk up the mountain. Yeah, how long can we do kids? Yours.
Cletus Cobbington 00:11:13 No, I wanted to talk about ears for an hour. First roll of the day. Oh, 26.
Kaladen Shash 00:11:15 Just let us let us continue. Ooh.
Dungeon Master 00:11:16 Okay. As you guys are walking, he needs more photos. As you guys take more steps upward, everybody go ahead and give me perception checks as you were moving. Let's go. 25, natural 20.
Leopold Magnus 00:11:43 I'd be good. Let's go. Let's go. Oh, yeah, not good. I'm not seeing or hearing anything.
Kaladen Shash 00:11:44 I see it.
Cyrus Schwert 00:11:45 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:11:49 Go, guys. Those are good role. Cletus and Caledon, you both get the same information, but through different sources. Caledon, you're the first to see it because you see, like, the faint reflection off the walls, the flickering of what looks like firelight to start with.
Cletus Cobbington 00:11:51 He sees more ears peeking over the distance.
Dungeon Master 00:12:18 but it's moving in sort of a linear fashion. And then Cletus, you pick up, you hear like some almost organized marching sounds humming as well. So as you guys, yeah, they sort of flick up and are catching something. We lost them. I'm not going to stop this time.
Cletus Cobbington 00:12:30 My cow ears. No. We got the bulk of the way. Yeah. We got the bulk of the session out of the way.
Cyrus Schwert 00:12:36 Cow here. It was doing so good. We got the good stuff. We got the good stuff. We managed to get through the good stuff. You didn't hear about my hand.
Kaladen Shash 00:12:42 I'm glad he was on while we could talk about yours.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:43 Damn. Yeah. Oh, man. Oh, man. I just felt like that was such a pivotal moment. I wanted to make sure he had heard it.
Dungeon Master 00:12:54 as you guys make your way up you see like an open lava stream sort of coming down the side of the mountain from like a recent eruption um you both everybody picks up on it but i'll say cletus and caledon catch wind of it first you sort of hear it you hear
Dungeon Master 00:13:23 flapping of wings and a huge burst of firelight sort of descend out of the clouds to the top of the mountain above you, but you don't see a whole lot of form other than the explosion of light as it comes into frame, so it sort of obfuscates everything.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:37 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:13:37 There's this loud screech of this enormous bird creature that rings out into your ears. And then you sort of crouch down and you see not on map yet, but this huge line of these sort of, as you would describe them, hyena-like creatures holding torches and various sort of handcrafted and chipped stone and.
Cletus Cobbington 00:13:37 Sure.
Dungeon Master 00:14:01 very primitive iron working weapons sort of going down single file down the path you have a chance there's there's a lot of them so you guys do have a chance to move around sneak past them however you would like to approach cornelius
Cletus Cobbington 00:14:20 Can you remind me of the Torto's name really quick? Cornelius. Didn't that old fart Cornelius say this was a hill? This is a damn volcano. That does make sense. He said it'd take him a long time just to get down to the village, so...
Cyrus Schwert 00:14:23 really is.
Kaladen Shash 00:14:24 Cornelia. Oh, what I want to say? Creed is.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:24 Yeah. Back when he came up here, probably was just a hill, probably erupted since then.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:33 Well, at his pace, I doubt he's ever been up here. He's only some 200 years old. He'd never make it.
Dungeon Master 00:14:47 Ruth. Ruth.
Cletus Cobbington 00:14:51 Yeah. I think this. I mean, I mean, Nat 20, right?
Kaladen Shash 00:14:55 but there's too many to engage but there's too many to engage i think we're understanding also too many techniques right here is a long a long line we're talking 40
Zariel Torgan 00:14:56 So are we thinking, are we thinking these are nulls? Are we thinking these are more quibbles? All right, so they're bigger, right? Yeah, like rough, rough numbers.
Cyrus Schwert 00:15:03 They're definitely in the nulls. Yeah, how many would you just?
Cletus Cobbington 00:15:21 He sees exactly how man. Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:24 Guys, I think we need to set a trap. No, these are different ears.
Dungeon Master 00:15:27 Roughly like 20 or so that you can see initially, but there's more behind. This is when you notice that the ears are completely different.
Cyrus Schwert 00:15:31 That's a fuck ton. Um, we should hide. It's gonna go. So. Now, they're like the same, basically. Hyenas and dragons.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:32 All right. I've got the perfect plan. We have the exact same ears that they have. We just put the ears that we've taken off on ourselves. We'll blend right in. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So you guys want to try to sneak? Because I can do a pass without a trace if that's what we're thinking.
Kaladen Shash 00:15:33 Yeah, this is a void. This is a move around situation. No, we have cobald. Yeah, we have cobald ears. Yeah, we have cobald ears.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:55 Oh, my God. I think that's, yeah. Yeah, I'm not very sneaky. Yeah, yeah, I'm terribly, terribly poorly sneaky. I have disadvantaged.
Kaladen Shash 00:16:01 I think we're going to have to try to sneak, and the two robots are going to have to get super sneaky. Probably Leopold. I mean, I don't know. It's thought. Yeah. I'm stealthy. I'm stealthy.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:07 Right, yeah, I'm going to cast past the trace then. Yeah, Leo. I'm not great. Like two. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:16:08 Who is the least sneaky? How is everybody else? I'm good.
Dungeon Master 00:16:12 Leopold. Yeah, you can get everybody. It's.
Cletus Cobbington 00:16:18 I'm really big. I have a plus one, so I'm not amazing. Yeah, I think it does the party. It says you and your companions.
Kaladen Shash 00:16:28 Yeah. If we get a pass without trace, it would be a big boost. If you can only cast it on a few people. Oh, then it's whoever's in the radius, I thought, when it starts. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:34 I can get like up to like 10 people. Let me double check, but I'm almost positive. I can. Yeah, but I think it's like, oh yeah, yeah. So everybody gets a plus 10. So for sneaky, we can do that.
Dungeon Master 00:16:42 Anybody who starts in the radius when it's cast, it's the benefit of it throughout. Nice. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:16:50 I'm also cool. I'm also going to cast a enhance ability on Leopold and Cletus and give them advantage on decks-based ability checks.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:04 Nice. Nice. Plus 10.
Kaladen Shash 00:17:05 Okay. So a flat stealth check. Is that what happens now? Sweet.
Cletus Cobbington 00:17:10 Oh. Oh. Oh. Um.
Dungeon Master 00:17:11 100%. Everybody go and give me those stealth checks. And then just to reward the perception check a little bit more. Calden, you can tell, like, across the lava stream, up sort of the hill side, it's not even like an established path, a lot of loose gravel and rock. You hear like a rattling of chain almost.
Cyrus Schwert 00:17:36 Jay. Put him away, dude. Put him away. Is there anything to, like, hide behind behind anywhere?
Cletus Cobbington 00:17:38 Kaladin, can you scoop me into your stealthy arms with that? Chip starts screaming when he sees all these knolls. I shove his mouth so full with almonds and shove him in my overall.
Kaladen Shash 00:17:42 My goodness. That's great first. I'm blowing it here. We got two net. We got two net 20s. That's strong. That's strong. No, no, no, no. You're getting straight, you're straight rolls right now.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:52 Oh, yeah. I have disadvantaged. Oh. I'm 25. No, that, I have disadvantage. I have this. Oh, well, that was the second one then. I feel like that's not really fair.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:52 So we've got a, we've got a 29, 12. Jesus Christ, yeah, two net 20s beat the net one. Get a flat roll. Yeah. Oh, no. Oh, no. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:18:11 great role. No, I pre-roll. No, I pre-rolled.
Kaladen Shash 00:18:17 okay that's not bad but so is that so 15 plus 10 though yeah yeah that's right that's right on it was a nat one it was a nat one it wasn't just a two i would
Leopold Magnus 00:18:19 Because I thought I disadvantaged, so I rolled two. I rolled 15 first. Yeah, so 25, yeah, yeah. Jonathan, I mean...
Zariel Torgan 00:18:24 That's 25. Yeah. Our average is really, really good. It's just whether or not Jonathan wants to make that one be bad.
Dungeon Master 00:18:40 And I average their check. It was a DC-11, which you definitely surpass. How would you guys like to maneuver?
Cyrus Schwert 00:18:48 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:18:49 That's good. So two canceled out the one. That's good. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:18:51 I was able to stuff almonds in his mouth before he screamed a little too loud.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:58 Ha, ha, ha.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:04 So Jonathan, I guess how much time do we have right now? Are they like charging right at us? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:19:10 until they sort of come frame they're no they're not charging they're like marching in line so if this is oh i don't have my drag little measuring on recent they're like 60 feet so they're they're moving at a brisk pace but you guys don't think you've been seen and you've got
Kaladen Shash 00:19:23 Would you say that we just scurried uphill off the path or something? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:19:35 You can go left and up if you'd like, or you can sort of crouch down and do something else if you're like, you could just let them pass. It's totally up to you. Since you guys beat the DC, they're big enough to hide behind that's what you would like to do.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:42 I'm just curious, is there any large boulders or giant rubble that we could use to create a landslide? Yeah. I'm just thinking, yeah, we could hide.
Cyrus Schwert 00:19:43 I'm on the let them pass train. How big are these? I think that's what we'd like to do.
Kaladen Shash 00:19:59 Yeah. Yeah. Let us observe.
Cletus Cobbington 00:20:06 I mean, they're, and they're marching in
Dungeon Master 00:20:11 Okay. You guys hide and you do have your like telepathic link set up so you don't have to talk verbally. You can talk through your minds. But it takes like minutes and minutes for this crowd, just like mob to sort of wind its way down the path. Eventually they sort of fade into the distance and
Leopold Magnus 00:20:11 I was thinking we have a good chance. Oh, good.
Dungeon Master 00:20:34 You unfortunately know that this means that a fog is sort of rolled into Cottonwood, and they're going to be like under siege. That's kind of how they described it as working. So you either have to backtrack there or keep going up and finish this quickly. We're not quickly. It took like a half a day to get there.
Zariel Torgan 00:20:43 Leo, was there something that... Was there something that... Was there something that you were wanting to do, Leo? Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:20:45 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:21:02 oh no uh no i think it's fine we can hide i don't think they were coming down the path like i was thinking or maybe they did but um i guess jonathan so did they go into the village then or are they still up the mountain okay and they were headed i see okay
Cletus Cobbington 00:21:12 well they have half a day
Dungeon Master 00:21:19 Again, it took hours to get from Cottonwood to where you are now. So they're on the mountain and they were going towards Cottonwood. Just past that. So, yeah, it's not like you have to sprint, but you don't have, like, a lot of time.
Kaladen Shash 00:21:19 You're heading. Yeah. Yes.
Leopold Magnus 00:21:31 And they just passed by us and they're headed towards Cottonwood. Well, I was just thinking, yeah, we could cut them off at the pass. We might be able to, like, trap them without having to fight.
Cyrus Schwert 00:21:43 And there's going to be some pretty big repercussions if that gets to cotton. These things look hardy. Oh, fuck.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:54 Did we notice? Yeah, that's good. Let's get to ask. So my... Yeah, I think that's the right. Yeah, I think that's the right way.
Kaladen Shash 00:21:59 I mean, Jonathan, after they passed us, would we have had an idea of actual number? So you said it took minutes. We heard 20 initially plus more. Yeah. How do you engage that, guys? We're going to kill the spirit that emboldes them.
Dungeon Master 00:21:59 Some of them. Well over a hundred.
Leopold Magnus 00:22:17 Yeah, well, so like what if we pulled like a 300 type deal? Is this pass narrow enough to where we could get a choke point? You know, we could like collapse some rubble and then just like push them into the lava. Yeah, that's fair.
Cyrus Schwert 00:22:18 Mm-hmm. Boulder anywhere right above them?
Zariel Torgan 00:22:25 I was... So, yeah, my question was going to be very similar. It was going to be, did we notice any sort of, like, natural, like, like, sheer cliffs that were tight or, like, you know, geographical things that would make it easier?
Dungeon Master 00:22:30 You'd have to do some serious searching. So you don't know if you had time for that, just because you didn't pre-scope it out. There was a long ascending sort of,
Kaladen Shash 00:22:34 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:22:51 I mean, where we were, where we just fought was like that. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:22:59 three person wide path only that was pretty steep um but that it you know they're they're already sort of on it and ahead of you so you'd have to get behind them without being seen and take on all
Zariel Torgan 00:23:14 All right, yeah, I think, I think Caledon's right. I think we, we go past and we hit him while they're gone. Yeah, get him scared.
Kaladen Shash 00:23:19 just kill their master and then come back for them. Correct.
Leopold Magnus 00:23:19 Yep, let's do it. And I'm sure that twirdle won't mind a few more of them Cottonwood villagers massacred. Let's carry on.
Cyrus Schwert 00:23:40 It's pretty heartless, vehicle. That's like really mean. We just met a lot of them. We were trying to convince them that you were like a person, right? And that kind of behavior is just not really helpful. They're the weird ones. We're normal.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:46 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:23:52 Oh, sorry that my analytical circuits just computing. Something weirder in the food chain.
Cletus Cobbington 00:23:58 Remember quote unquote, they're the weird ones. Wow. I'm actually a little bit surprised, Cyrus, that you've come full circle against robots. It just took more animal folk to turn you.
Dungeon Master 00:23:59 Ha ha ha ha ha.
Kaladen Shash 00:24:02 Oh.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:18 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:24:20 Yeah, I really don't like animals. More of a robot guy now. Really not an animal guy. More of plants. I like plants.
Cletus Cobbington 00:24:24 I scratched my huge cow ear. All right. Let's move on.
Dungeon Master 00:24:30 Okay, guys, as they pass, you have the path directly ahead, or you have the area sort of hand-in-foot crawl up the kind of slope that you heard some noise on some sort of plateau up there, sort of two routes you can take.
Leopold Magnus 00:24:30 Well, it's such a wonder you get along.
Cletus Cobbington 00:24:56 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:24:56 We must, yes, we must hit towards the plateau, towards the fighter spirit. Yeah, I think it lasts quite a while, like an hour. What does that spell? Yeah, we can keep, we can keep climbing, get to scope it out.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:04 Yeah, let's do it. Yeah, that's a while. Yeah. Might as well sneak. Do we need to re-roll since we're moving instead of just like crouching?
Leopold Magnus 00:25:05 Indeed.
Dungeon Master 00:25:10 Fire spirit you would assume is, that's not trace is an hour? You could roll, but I'm not going to waste that just because there is nothing you're rolling against.
Cyrus Schwert 00:25:11 Can we, how long does it pass without trace last? Do we sneak up here? Maybe we should proceed with caution. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:25:28 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:38 Oh, you hear that guys? Let's go the other way. Sound, right? Is that what we decided? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sneakily.
Leopold Magnus 00:25:40 I'm all ears.
Cyrus Schwert 00:25:41 I think so I think so.
Dungeon Master 00:25:43 So are you guys, there's the sound to your left that's sort of a little bit out of the way and then the direct path up. Okay. How do you want to traverse over this is like 15 foot wide sort of gap of like lava flip?
Kaladen Shash 00:25:58 Yes, I look around the motor sound, yes? We got to get across that. We've got to get across that sweet, sweet problem.
Cletus Cobbington 00:26:06 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:16 Although we gotta get across. Um, let's see.
Kaladen Shash 00:26:25 Can we, how much, how difficult would it be to jump on the rock in the middle, a little higher up? You know, one, two, rather than all at once. Okay. Yes. That could be, that could be good. You say that's acrobatic is what that would be?
Dungeon Master 00:26:33 It would be in like an average DC of like acrobatics check. You don't know exactly how much, but.
Cletus Cobbington 00:26:35 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:26:42 Uh, meopold and clea still have an advantage on deck space checks.
Leopold Magnus 00:26:49 How much time do we have? We can maybe fashion something, like to help cross us, like a little bridge. So any like spare parts in the toolbox that I could lash together to like give us a slight advantage? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:27:03 I mean, your artificer ability, I think it's just called the right tool for the job. You can spend like 10 minutes making anything you need. So you could assemble like a ladder walking bridge or something or some sort of mechanism for like swinging across. You could do like anything you want if you spend time doing it. Or you could jump.
Leopold Magnus 00:27:26 Okay. I mean, what do you guys think? We want to move faster and just take the risk or you want me to build a little something? Oh, hold on. Hold on. I've got... Go ahead.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:33 What's the jumping mechanic again? Is it strength plus five? Or what is what is jump mechanics? Yeah, I think it's like...
Cletus Cobbington 00:27:34 I mean, how long would it take to build a... How long would it take to build a... How long would it take to just, you know, push a tree over or whatever? Make a little log...
Dungeon Master 00:27:41 I can just do a jump calculator for each of you. I forget what it is.
Cyrus Schwert 00:28:03 There's no trees around here, dude. We're on top of the mountains. There's lava. We're dumping over lava. There's no trees. Sorry, dude, but that's, that was crazy. A tall is Cyrus? Um, I would have to look at normal. I'm the normal one. There's a size.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:04 I don't think there's any trees. 5.6.
Cletus Cobbington 00:28:06 I look just there. Oh, I see you. Oh. I see.
Kaladen Shash 00:28:09 Cyrus, Cyrus says there's no. Yes.
Dungeon Master 00:28:10 How tall is Cyrus? How tall is Cyrus? Like, actually. Yeah. Zareil 6 foot. What's Zareal strength for?
Cletus Cobbington 00:28:32 whoever the next tallest is i'll hold your ankles and we'll flip over
Cyrus Schwert 00:28:38 Where would you find?
Leopold Magnus 00:28:38 Jonathan, I've got something small that. Oh, God.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:39 Strength is zero. Hmm? Sorry, what? My normal score is 11. Only 5 feet in number.
Dungeon Master 00:28:42 I mean, what's the number? 10. Zaryl can jump 10 feet horizontally. Yeah, Zaryl could jump jump to the rock. What is Caledon's height and strength score? What's the number?
Kaladen Shash 00:28:55 Okay, I must be close to that. 6.2 is height and strength is plus 1. 13. And is that like I don't need to, I don't need to. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:29:13 Caledon can jump 13 feet, so he can jump to the rock but not past it. What is? Who else has got their number? I need strength score, not modifier, and then height. Is it able to take age?
Cletus Cobbington 00:29:20 Thanks.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:24 What is it you need, Jonathan? Strength and desk. Strength score. Yeah, so my strength score is 15 or like a plus two. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:41 I am. It's all. It's all. It's like hopping over a puddle.
Dungeon Master 00:29:42 Leopold could span the gap on a pretty easy acrobatics check. Clea, how tall are you, and what's your strength? 13. What's some cleatist's the strength score?
Kaladen Shash 00:29:47 that's sweet that means oh you can hurdle it
Cyrus Schwert 00:29:49 Mine's 13 and 5.10. You're huge. Like a minotaur.
Cletus Cobbington 00:29:52 Eight feet tall and 12 strength. It's just a little long step. I do a long jump. That's what I'm saying. 12.
Dungeon Master 00:30:13 Actually, Leopold, not Leopold, Cleopold could only get halfway. It steers is 12 feet horse. Yeah. Leopold could go the whole way. And then, so basically, Rex, you have to make one check. Everybody else has to make two checks. That's all.
Kaladen Shash 00:30:19 Okay. No, I mean, we jump again. So it's one jump, second jump.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:21 So we have only two of the party and they're trapped at the center section. But can you make it a second?
Cletus Cobbington 00:30:30 Thanks.
Zariel Torgan 00:30:32 Double jump.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:39 Right. I was just, I have this rope trick spell. If I just kind of cast it mid gap between the two, like a rope would come out and maybe we could swing. Would that give us any advantage? Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:30:52 Swing. Maybe just one check instead two. Sweet.
Dungeon Master 00:30:53 Yeah, 100%. So, like, Leopold wouldn't have to make a check to jump halfway because that's well within your jump distance. So Leopold could jump, set up the rope trick high enough that you could swing the rope, and then everybody could just get it. Yeah. Good use of utility and ability. That's great. You guys jump across. As you're sort of going up the hill,
Leopold Magnus 00:31:09 Just swinging across. Yeah. Let's do that.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:12 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:31:22 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 00:31:23 It levels out to this pretty flat, carved out area. And what you see is pretty gruesome. There is this old sort of avian bird-like gentleman, it seems like.
Dungeon Master 00:31:39 who he's like chackled to this like stone wall. He's very bloody. His feathers are falling out. He's like got a long sort of black beak. He's like looks more like a crow than anything with a little bit of red at the tip of everything. He lets out like a stifled cock.
Dungeon Master 00:31:59 as he's like mostly unconscious. But you see occasionally he shifts and the chains that are like holding his wing arms up hit the wall and that's what you would hurt. Approach him.
Cletus Cobbington 00:32:11 Hmm. Are we up? Up to?
Cyrus Schwert 00:32:12 And. Thank you. Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:32:15 We did this to you. How long have you been here? Can you hear me? These, they all speak filled with all these animals. I'd be there. Let's talk them.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:15 Does he speak Sylvan or does he speak common? Tongues is temporary?
Leopold Magnus 00:32:27 Oh, Zario, suppose you ever, yeah, I'm not speaking. Well, do I speak, Sylvan, no? Is that guy, he gave me a, oh, okay. I see, I see. I was just going to turn to Zareel and say, suppose you've ever seen a big bird like that before.
Dungeon Master 00:32:35 You do not... I think it's probably one. Brooke midway through. Just that...
Cyrus Schwert 00:32:50 Only on Sesame Street. He has pneumonia. He has pneumonia. You can tell by the wheeze.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:50 Not quite like that. He's not eating his weedies. This one looks sickly.
Kaladen Shash 00:33:09 That's all he does. He just coughed. I just stare at him. He said, sir, you have cough. That's it. We are adventures, my friend. What are you doing here? We are adventures, my friend. What are you doing here?
Cletus Cobbington 00:33:15 We're your humble heroes.
Dungeon Master 00:33:16 Okay, sorry, you guys are just not up to him on the map. You approach him. You get all the way up to there. You sort of like, he doesn't notice that you're there. So you, like, have to, like, get kind of close and press on. And you see he jerks up. And he just goes, who are you?
Leopold Magnus 00:33:20 Oh.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:21 Oh.
Cyrus Schwert 00:33:40 We're adventurers. You go to years. I'm an adventure now. It's really fun. It's cool. It's like I'm larking, but for real.
Kaladen Shash 00:33:42 This one's new at it, but he really likes. Very excited. Very good at it right now.
Cletus Cobbington 00:33:55 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:59 Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:34:02 He chuckles to him, so it's adventure. Just what a man like me needs. Sort of peeks up an eye. He's got like a little bit of an ember burning behind his, otherwise black bird eyes. And he goes, I reckon you don't want to help this old crow with one last favor before he passes.
Cyrus Schwert 00:34:31 What is it? It depends
Kaladen Shash 00:34:31 What do you ask?
Zariel Torgan 00:34:34 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:34:37 Sorry, this is such a little shit now.
Dungeon Master 00:34:38 He like moves his body over and pulls out. He's got like this pendant of like this fiery bird sort of etched into stone that hangs sort of at his neck. And he goes, I just want to see the restoration of my lord who's been misled. And now he is under worship of these creatures. But he.
Cyrus Schwert 00:35:03 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:35:08 He just wanted to fly before he got lost. He sort of motions up the hill. He goes, I serve my great master of the fire spirit, but he roosted for a while and was eventually he came onto by this cult of fanatics and they did something to him, corrupted him. Now he flies dragging this flame instead of encompassing it like he used to.
Dungeon Master 00:35:36 I just wish to see him set free before he loses his way forever, coughs again, a little bit of bird blood hits the ground. He always, he was born in the age of the war of the creatures and the cursed versus the living. He lives to fight.
Kaladen Shash 00:35:46 How do we set him free? What makes him weaker?
Cyrus Schwert 00:35:47 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:36:04 I don't ask that you spare him. I just ask that you engage. Do him justice. Did the music stop for you guys? Because it's just my. That's not working. Okay. It's not playing for me. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:36:15 Hmm.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:16 So kill him. I hear it. Yeah, it's cool good. Yeah. Or all or just.
Kaladen Shash 00:36:16 Fight him. I hear it. It's like quarry. That's funny. And what makes your God weaker? We need to know if we're going to take him down. Clearly, he's been corrupted, sir. Sir,
Cyrus Schwert 00:36:20 I still hear it. Yeah, you look at. Yeah, you look pretty weak right now.
Leopold Magnus 00:36:22 Yep, still working.
Dungeon Master 00:36:36 Would I worship a creature with any weaknesses? Would you admit weakness of your own? He doesn't do anything. He gets a little frustrated. I get chained to this wall. He's like, you come. I ask for favor. You're insulting. My God. He doesn't do anything but get assaulted by this cult.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:42 From the looks of you.
Kaladen Shash 00:36:46 Sir, your God is out of control. What do you mean? He's full of weaknesses. Let me. I will do him justice? Don't you worry?
Cletus Cobbington 00:36:50 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:37:07 Well, I was thinking about helping out, but now I'm thinking about telling this old bird to eat crow.
Zariel Torgan 00:37:15 I mean, I think we just pretend to be a cult
Cyrus Schwert 00:37:20 That's really funny. Cyrus doesn't laugh, but he says that's really funny.
Kaladen Shash 00:37:23 Does. What is your name grow? Higher tongue.
Cletus Cobbington 00:37:25 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:37:34 I'm known as elder pyre, Tom.
Zariel Torgan 00:37:46 And it'll just follow us. I think that's a good plan, right? Elderer.
Leopold Magnus 00:37:52 We just infiltrate the cult. How did you spell the name, Jonathan? By her tongue, okay.
Cyrus Schwert 00:37:53 I do have white Nike's in my bag. I have Nike decades in my backpack. I have five pairs.
Kaladen Shash 00:38:04 Well.
Dungeon Master 00:38:07 elder and then P-Y-R-E-Tong as in tongue. His full thing is Apostle of the Flame, but, you know, you don't know that.
Leopold Magnus 00:38:21 Oh, prior tongue, what was it like before this big old bird fire spirit took off and got corrupted by them knolls? How were the good old days treating you?
Dungeon Master 00:38:36 Well, I wasn't alive for the war, but once the general settled on the mountain, everything flourished in his presence. The good weather, the protection. Folks started settling in the valleys as everything was very bountiful. And the balance stayed that way. Offerings were made. People were happy. I taught those to who wanted to see it, and then these fanatics came in. At first, just curious, and then...
Cletus Cobbington 00:39:00 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:39:07 One day they overtook me and chained me here, and I've watched some time as they've slowly corrupted my Lord. You know, unusual stuff. I would rather him be free than see the world like this.
Kaladen Shash 00:39:15 If we kill them, we'll disrupt the balance you speak of. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:39:19 Interesting. And what would you say these, uh, go ahead.
Cletus Cobbington 00:39:30 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:30 So, I was just going to say, so just to be clear, freeing him is killing him, or is there some sort of extra instructions we need?
Kaladen Shash 00:39:46 No, he said, he said engage.
Dungeon Master 00:39:46 Again, this very malnourne, close to death, Rose, like, honestly, like, I wouldn't, I don't want you to kill him. He's my, you know, my whole thing, prostrate myself before him on the daily, my man. But you guys, you guys kind of give up a weird vibe, and I feel like you'd kill him more than anything. And as long as he died and fight, that's also pretty honorable.
Kaladen Shash 00:40:17 Yes, we will give him honorable death. Don't worry. Where can we ambush him if he has no weakness? Where does he go? You do. Yes, you are the apostle of the flame, my friend. You know everything about him. I just slap him.
Cyrus Schwert 00:40:22 You're the one. You're the one prostating yourself.
Leopold Magnus 00:40:25 Oh. Hello, Caledon.
Dungeon Master 00:40:26 Who has information like this? Do you think I spent time thinking about how to ambush him? Fuck you guys. I'm just fucking dying here. He roosted his mess on his own.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:26 Catch him on the Godcan.
Leopold Magnus 00:40:42 I'm not sure he knows those things, you know. It seems like maybe he's a humble servant. If you were to say, was there one thing that all of these, you know, heretics had in common? Did they share a common book? Maybe something that they, you know, we could take advantage of?
Cletus Cobbington 00:40:50 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:41:02 No, not really. I mean, they follow the scripture that I taught, but they just sort of, again, they came as learners originally. And then one of them took the sort of lead and started taking things a little far. And now they just care more about the bloodshed to get the offerings than anything.
Cyrus Schwert 00:41:13 It's
Leopold Magnus 00:41:23 Owen, who was that general that took charge? Okay, if you don't have the answer, that's fine.
Dungeon Master 00:41:30 okay i fucking ask some questions that i don't know uh no okay i got it his this crow coughs out uh having spent so much energy hit with his truly laugh breaths he goes his name was emory razor back uh
Kaladen Shash 00:41:35 It doesn't matter. We need to... What? What? Less.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:35 Jerry, huh? Jerry's a cool name. Like, oh yeah, he's dead. Shit, that's cooler name.
Cyrus Schwert 00:41:39 You can just let the crow die now. I had a lot of spells I could have used to keep them alive, but, like, that wasn't worth it.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:58 I was going to say, hey, hey, Zario, don't you still have that free speak to the dead spell? I'm just kidding. I don't know, I have no questions.
Cletus Cobbington 00:42:03 I didn't want to use my spell slots.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:11 Yeah, but I feel like this creek's been run dry. I think... I feel like... I wouldn't mind bringing him back just to really fuck with him some more. I think we're probably all right. We're the evil ones.
Cyrus Schwert 00:42:12 Make sure you ask him the question. We want to know. For the Odeers.
Kaladen Shash 00:42:14 Yeah, we're pretty good.
Dungeon Master 00:42:27 You guys are the bad guys. Everybody can see another round of stealth checks. You still have passed without a trace.
Leopold Magnus 00:42:32 No, I wouldn't do that, but I thought the thought of it was funny.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:39 Let's go kill a bird like sun god. All right. Does this bird have ears?
Cletus Cobbington 00:42:41 And so the no is moved on.
Kaladen Shash 00:42:44 Let us find this bird fire spirit. Listen to Zario.
Dungeon Master 00:42:56 You still have your enhanced ability as you guys make your way.
Cyrus Schwert 00:42:58 You still have advantage. Also, Leopold still has advantage. I imagine it's been less than an hour still.
Leopold Magnus 00:43:04 Oh, good thing I have passed without a trace. Oh, well, I have... Yeah, but I have disadvantage for stealth. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:43:13 What did the enhanceability do?
Dungeon Master 00:43:26 Yeah, it hasn't been that long. So, yeah, advantage and disadvantage is just flat, yeah. Unfortunately. No, he's like he was long stripped of his clothes and, like, humiliation.
Cyrus Schwert 00:43:29 Oh, so you got flat. Got it. So you still get to 16, as long as that's still going. Nice.
Leopold Magnus 00:43:37 Yep, plus, yeah, 16. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:40 Yeah, we should be deecent. Did he have any of the stuff on him that he had in the picture, like any garb or books or? Okay. Yeah, we're closed. All right, sweet, so now we're headed back the other way, right?
Dungeon Master 00:44:07 Yeah, you guys head up. You're not sure how quiet you are. Leopold trips over and you realize just how clingy he actually is, like a big ring of metal because he's got a lot of intricate gears and inner batteries and stuff, but there's a lot of hollow space in the armor. So anytime you hit something wrong, it fully resonates. You take a moment, pause, and then you keep moving up. And all of you...
Kaladen Shash 00:44:28 Tung.
Cletus Cobbington 00:44:37 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:44:37 are unnoticed, but what you see as you approach is this. This doesn't show actually what it looks like. This is a large fire bird, but it's a very low blue flame. It's feathers are in tatters, very multi and unhealthy. It lets out this sort of...
Dungeon Master 00:44:58 strained screech towards itself as it sits in this nest that it's like on the edge of this sort of magma pit lots of gems and gold nuggets all these precious stones sort of scattered around the nest's offerings over time the birds sort of adjust itself sort of picking at its flumes of a big feather sort of falls out just with the touch but you guys are in notice what would you guys like to do as you walk up
Cletus Cobbington 00:45:16 This is how you call him a hawk. This is how you calm a hawk. Throw a towel over its head.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:28 All right. If we had a big blanket, it would think it's nighttime. I don't think we have a blanket that big blanket that big.
Leopold Magnus 00:45:37 Well, you know, Zario, I do like that idea. And I just cough out the all or nothing coin. And I say, do you want to take it for a spend? I guess for your guys' background.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:41 Oh.
Cyrus Schwert 00:45:41 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:45:49 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:45:59 Yeah, this bird, roughly, is 60 feet in height, and you estimate that its wingspan can get like 200 feet if it was full and it's fender's record. It is an enormous bird. You could try to put a blanket over it, but it's a large creature.
Kaladen Shash 00:46:12 Oh, it's massive. We're not gonna get one.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:17 things huge. Yeah. Some things sound better as ideas. Just throw a rag on its face. It's like... Yeah. What do you guys think? Do you want to, like, try to surround this thing and just try to fuck it up? Or
Cyrus Schwert 00:46:25 You can try to put blank. You can certainly
Leopold Magnus 00:46:33 Probably work for like a turn or two. You get advantage.
Kaladen Shash 00:46:46 I think we all take, yes, we all coordinate first attack. Can we talk to it? It's leading hundreds of Knowles. It's a spirit. It's not like they worship it. I don't know if it's a god.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:47 want to talk to it it's a god right i mean it's a bard right i mean you got a bard it's got to be at least 17 or 18
Cletus Cobbington 00:47:07 He hates animals, he hates them.
Leopold Magnus 00:47:07 I don't know if any of us have high enough charisma to do anything useful. Oh yeah, yeah. Travis, you want to talk to this guy? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:47:19 Do I want to talk to the giant bird? I really don't like birds. They're like nasty. Look at him cleaning his stuff. He's disgusting.
Zariel Torgan 00:47:19 Tell them how much... Tell them how much you hate animals. Yeah, first off, I don't like you. But other than that... I think... Yep. Should we spread out?
Kaladen Shash 00:47:25 Hey, hey, science. Everyone take free. So, yes, everyone take free turn.
Leopold Magnus 00:47:38 Well, that leaves us one choice. Slash it down. Yeah, good idea.
Zariel Torgan 00:47:50 I feel like we should coordinate a little. I feel like it's going to be hard if it can fly. We probably need to find a way to like ground it. We could do what we did last time. If somebody wants, I could polymorph somebody into something real big and it could like bear hug it maybe. Or snakes are, snakes are okay. My giant snakes like snakes like.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:12 What about a snake? Snake constrict? Yeah. What's the biggest animal you have? That's a good idea.
Zariel Torgan 00:48:21 Like 20 or 30 feet. And this thing's like 60. I feel like it might be... Yeah. It might be a little tight. I'm open to suggestions. I got... I'm cool.
Kaladen Shash 00:48:26 It'd be a choker. Just, poop, a little choker.
Cletus Cobbington 00:48:26 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:48:41 Let's see, so we're level 8, so CR 8 Beast. So let's just do this real quick.
Dungeon Master 00:48:54 He was a Bradale student while he's looking that up. What's sort of the game plan? Okay. You're surprised at action as the mirror image.
Cletus Cobbington 00:48:55 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:49:01 If we're going to fight this thing, I'm going to, I'll probably cast mere image again. Use my action for that.
Leopold Magnus 00:49:01 It's a good idea, yeah. What kind of terrain, what kind of cover do we have? It's a pretty open platform.
Cyrus Schwert 00:49:03 It's supposed.
Dungeon Master 00:49:21 Pretty open platform. If you go far enough down, you sort of go towards that, you know, 15 foot wide sort of pretty steep walking path. But as you sort of crest the top, there's like some lower, like hard stone deposit and lava rock sort of build up areas. But most of it's been hewn really flat by this bird and like the creation of its nest in its area. And it's got...
Zariel Torgan 00:49:32 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:49:49 um its nest is built out of entire trees sort of staffed in like pieces of old houses and like large stones and mud and like you just see like entire like like it picked up a whole grass patch and just ripped the whole thing out of the ground like it is this hodgepodge nest made of different things um so you can definitely sneak up and under but you would have to like climb up and into the nest to engage it in the nest or get it out of it somehow that's up to you
Leopold Magnus 00:50:10 So, right? Are you telling me, there's like a lot of wood in this bird's nest, something pretty flammable maybe? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:50:22 Yeah. Yes.
Kaladen Shash 00:50:24 Very much. Pretty much would.
Leopold Magnus 00:50:28 Okay, I'm gonna try and sneak up kind of underneath that platform and I'm gonna cast create bonfire up underneath it so that the bonfire just ignites the whole nest of the bird. Oh shit, fuck, I forgot about that. Yeah, that's probably gonna be useless. Very good point.
Cletus Cobbington 00:50:41 I mean, he is a fire bird. So don't know what that would potentially do. Fanning the fire and really trying to get this going to get this going.
Cyrus Schwert 00:50:43 Is his nest made of wood? Is his nest made of wood? Yeah, clearly the nest is the priority.
Kaladen Shash 00:50:54 Destroy the nest. Get him angry. Getting very angry, very quick.
Leopold Magnus 00:50:58 Yeah, he's going to be very angry.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:01 He's going to be spending multiple turns, re-gathering his nest. Yeah. Yeah. He's a homeowner. So, yeah. I might, I think probably the most practical will be the giant ape just because it's got the throwing rocks attack.
Cyrus Schwert 00:51:14 He will take care of that first. Homeowner.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:29 So even if it's like way up in the air, then it's still distance. So anybody that feels like they're going to be the least effective by something up in the air, I could do that. So just as a thought. But that's just something I'm thinking. If anybody else has any other ideas, there's also a huge giant crab that I could try, that could like grab a leg or something. So.
Cletus Cobbington 00:51:29 the rocks were good.
Kaladen Shash 00:51:29 Oh yeah, that was pretty powerful.
Leopold Magnus 00:51:31 Yeah. I'm down to try whatever.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:00 I have good range, so if somebody else is more grounded, then that would be a good idea.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:04 Yeah, whoever feels like they'd be the least effective, you know, if I made you a giant ape, you'd have, let's just double check here. 157 hit points, plus 9 to hit, two attacks, and you can make two fist attacks or one rock attack, and that's plus 9 to hit, and it's 7d6 plus 6 bludging damage. So it just does decent. Yeah, so anyway, yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:52:09 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:29 Yeah, it's pretty solid. Well, uh, kind of kind of like the pot calling calling the kettle black, don't you think?
Cyrus Schwert 00:52:30 It's pretty sick. I mean, I'm pretty, I just kind of have a sword. I mean, if you're telling me that I could be a big monkey, like, that would be cool. I'm open to new experiences. Maybe my horizons will draw them.
Kaladen Shash 00:52:37 Could be good ways to start fight for you. Quit. excited if you're okay being animal, but you don't like them. So what you're saying now? There's word for that.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:41 Yeah. He's gonna say, you're saying it's, it's an animal.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:59 But I'm not gonna fight it. It was a good time. Dang, dang, dang. What are you saying over there, Cyrus?
Cyrus Schwert 00:53:02 Who's the kettle? What? What? I mean, if I, if you want me to be a big monkey, like I'll do it. That's all I'm saying. I would like to do it. Do you want me to like to do it? Do you want me to beg?
Zariel Torgan 00:53:15 All right. All right. Oh, yeah. Yeah, so you want it. All right. All right. All right. All right. Well, then I'm going to wait because I think he's going to be really loud until I see stuff happening and then I'll cast polymorph. That'll be my action.
Cyrus Schwert 00:53:30 I really want to be the big monkey. Please.
Cletus Cobbington 00:53:33 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:53:37 So I'm actually, since the fire in the nest probably won't do much. I'll just call bone crusher out. And I'll tell him to attack with his cannon as my action.
Dungeon Master 00:53:46 Okay. So we got two of the actions taken care of what is everybody else doing?
Zariel Torgan 00:54:00 You can hold your action.
Kaladen Shash 00:54:11 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 00:54:12 and then.
Cyrus Schwert 00:54:14 I just look angry. That's my action. I just, gur at the bird. I mean.
Dungeon Master 00:54:18 No prep. No, no anything. Holding erection doesn't do anything about surprise around because he'd use it or lose it. Okay. Anything from Caledon?
Zariel Torgan 00:54:26 Oh. That's fair. You don't have like a... Nah, never mind. It'd be good. You snarl at it. Give it the old mean mug. I like to imagine you're starting to slowly turn as I'm holding it. Just getting a little fuzzy. Oh. Do I have to roll to see... Oh, go ahead. Sorry.
Cyrus Schwert 00:54:45 It's like Tarzan.
Cletus Cobbington 00:54:47 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:54:50 I already. I said I already did my mirror image. That was my acting.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:59 Oh, okay. Do I need to roll to see how successful my polymorph turns since last time it was a bit of a little guy? Oh, okay. It's because technically I'd seen an ape, but I'd never seen a giant ape. And so the rules are I have to have seen it, not just hear about it. And so you're like, well, roll to see...
Dungeon Master 00:54:59 Oh, mirror image, okay. Caledon, hungry. Um, no. I don't know why we did it last time. Uh,
Cyrus Schwert 00:55:22 I don't want to be a normal size monkey. If it's going to be normal size, I don't want to do it.
Kaladen Shash 00:55:25 Don't do that to them.
Dungeon Master 00:55:27 I think since you've done it once, you can picture it bigger. We'll count that.
Zariel Torgan 00:55:32 Gotcha. All right. Can I make it... He's going to be huge. I want to... Can I make it with, like, a man bun on top, and I wanted to be lime green. Lime green. Come on to you. Yeah, he's got the tightest. Just, you know... I get to choose.
Leopold Magnus 00:55:40 What the fuck? What the fuck? He's, like, his fur has been dyed, green. God. Are you just like an awful, like, zookeeper?
Cletus Cobbington 00:55:50 Does he still have a tight choker? Limebring. He's Beast Boy, bro. The team titans theme song starts playing. It's Beast Boy.
Zariel Torgan 00:56:01 Yeah, like it looks really unnatural. It looks bad. Just feeding him Kiwi's nonstop. It's manic panic. Green power.
Cyrus Schwert 00:56:04 I was just... I used the dive from the box. It's just for men.
Leopold Magnus 00:56:11 You like. Oh, my God.
Kaladen Shash 00:56:15 Well.
Cletus Cobbington 00:56:23 All right. Can I do my action? I want to do a third level conjure animals, and I'm going to conjure two giant turkey vultures. And they're going to swoop onto my arms, and I'm going to have them fly up in the air to where, when we go, they'll fly in two.
Dungeon Master 00:56:31 Yeah, what do you want to do?
Zariel Torgan 00:56:44 Nice. Like. Like almonds.
Dungeon Master 00:57:00 Is it actually called Turkey vulture? It is. It was just giant vulgar, right?
Cletus Cobbington 00:57:03 It's a giant, giant vulture. There's turkey vultures all around the farmlands. Yeah. I tuck chip as such as you. I took chip further into my overalls.
Kaladen Shash 00:57:14 It. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 00:57:15 They're buzzards looking for almonds. Is that a little animal? Okay. Oh my gosh. He's cute. He's cute. That's a cute cat, actually. I don't really like animals, but that's a cute cat.
Leopold Magnus 00:57:23 That cat is zonked.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:23 These cats, they keep crawling up because they like to be part of what's going on. So it's... All right.
Dungeon Master 00:57:36 Okay. Everybody go ahead and roll initiative them.
Kaladen Shash 00:57:45 And
Cletus Cobbington 00:57:46 That was cute. 17. Let's see. What are my. Okay, I roll initiative for them as well. So the second role initiative for them as well.
Leopold Magnus 00:57:55 Damn.
Cyrus Schwert 00:57:56 Thanks.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:59 Six. Do you need the stats for the giant ape?
Dungeon Master 00:58:13 Yeah. Okay, and they'll go on a group initiative. Right. Oh, no, it is right there is right there.
Cletus Cobbington 00:58:15 Wait, do they have a bonus to an issue? Yeah. They got eight.
Cyrus Schwert 00:58:29 I pulled them up. You can see my big monthly packs, but you can't see my man done.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:37 He's not green like I, but.
Leopold Magnus 00:58:37 That's hilarious. Yeah. That's okay. You tucked them away. No, remember?
Dungeon Master 00:58:39 Okay, well, I couldn't, I wasn't going to Google green giant ape d and D. He is exactly as Jesse describes him, but the photo doesn't represent it.
Kaladen Shash 00:58:42 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:58:57 Do I still have my normal voice? Can I still talk? That makes sense. No, there's no. Seven. Not the worst.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:06 That's all right. I'm happy. Theater than mine. Oh, it's like nothing. It's decent.
Cletus Cobbington 00:59:06 Use your imagination. My birds have a negative two.
Dungeon Master 00:59:09 I'm going to say, but as soon as... What's its intelligence? I think seven is like you could talk like a child. Six is the basis of speech. Okay. You guys also have the telepathic thing. So you don't have to talk.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:09 I just remember you can't, you know, you can't talk.
Cyrus Schwert 00:59:30 Okay, I'll try my best. Oh. Oh. I'd speak like an infant, not a child.
Cletus Cobbington 00:59:34 I go, Cyrus, how do you feel bad animals now?
Kaladen Shash 00:59:40 No.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:44 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:59:47 With the formation of the giant ape, it's huge. This giant bird sees it. You can't hide at this point. The ape is way too large. First step is going to be Calvin. You see this bird doesn't like fly, but its wings go out and expand. Plumes of feathers go flying and sort of settle down as it turns and it steps up onto the nest. You are first to act.
Kaladen Shash 01:00:15 Um, and is this map to scale for distance? Okay. Uh, there's a, there's a, yeah, there's like a ruler. So it's like 60, it's like 60 feet from me 55 to the edge of the token. Um,
Cyrus Schwert 01:00:18 I don't see the grid.
Dungeon Master 01:00:20 Yes. There is no grid, but if you drag your token, you can have a sentence as drag while measuring, or there's also just a ruler. If you go to your settings tab and you scroll down, it says measure while dragging and see how far you've traveled.
Cletus Cobbington 01:00:32 Use the ruler. Oh, yeah. I got to close that one giggling out of a monkey.
Cyrus Schwert 01:00:54 Okay. Bill Bird, kill the bird.
Kaladen Shash 01:00:54 I'm going to cast... I'm going to cast Entangle. It's a 20-foot... We can do it every while. You're good. I'm going to cast Entangle.
Cletus Cobbington 01:01:05 The DM left. We can do whatever we want.
Dungeon Master 01:01:08 Sorry. Somebody fucking called me some unknown number and it threw off my Discord. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:01:09 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:24 Do you want to drop a 20 by 20 AOE? I'm just going to put it all around the bird in the nest so that the battlefield's kind of open, but maybe we can pin the bird where it is a little bit or try. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:01:29 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 01:01:42 It's 90 feet. 45. More than enough. Absolute. Oh, range is.
Cletus Cobbington 01:01:44 Thanks.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:59 It's a 20 foot square. I think that's massive. I think that's massive. I don't know why that appears so large. Yeah. Range 90. That's why I can cast from my app. There we go. That's why I figured token size. That's what I figured. Yeah. Bloop. It's a saving through a strength.
Dungeon Master 01:02:18 That's right on it. What is this best fix? Okay. Strength saving throw.
Cletus Cobbington 01:02:36 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 01:02:48 That is 26. The entangle is...
Kaladen Shash 01:02:53 Absolutely saves. Otherwise, it would have been, otherwise it would have been restrained. But I think it still makes it difficult terrain if it walks.
Cyrus Schwert 01:03:01 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 01:03:03 Yeah, the area, you have these, you guys weren't paying super attention to the inside, but as you, like, jump up and get a peek, there's these huge crisscross trees and the sort of tangle it, but the inside of the nest is burnt down, like embers, kind of scorched down, like the nest has a life that has to be sort of replaced with time. The entangle these huge roots and vines sort of explode out of the embers and the tarcels and everything, but not enough to entangle this bird who just sort of,
Cletus Cobbington 01:03:16 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:03:30 flaps as enormous wings, all of the fire sort of brightens up in that moment as it sort of just goes up for a second and settles back down on the vines. Anything else? A 30 will take you to the front of the group if you want to get to the front. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:03:42 No, use 30 feet just to get out of the very back. Okay, just like screwed around the edge. Now we'll move up to there for this, start of that round.
Dungeon Master 01:03:59 After that, it is Giant Cyrus 8. And he's muted. Okay. Throw her up.
Cyrus Schwert 01:04:14 Sorry, I was coughing. Giant apes going to throw a rock. Is that? That's just a hit. What's time? Fuck.
Cletus Cobbington 01:04:15 Yeah, that works.
Kaladen Shash 01:04:23 Yeah. That's sweet. What is the modifier? A lot of strength. Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:04:29 To hit or a save? Roll the hit. Like a 9. 11 misses.
Cyrus Schwert 01:04:44 I throw a big ass rock over my head like a soccer player. And I would imagine that I hit the bird. Rick. I mean, I could move, but.
Dungeon Master 01:04:52 You throw it and it's just a little too bit of a line drive and it hits lower to the base of the nest. And a tree explodes as it cracks and splinters. The rock gets scattered off to the side. That's all you can do, correct. Go ahead and move yourself if you'd like to. Yeah. Otherwise, leap hold it is your go.
Cletus Cobbington 01:05:04 Thanks.
Kaladen Shash 01:05:08 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:05:14 I'm going to kind of put myself, I'm not kind of put myself at the head of the group here, just to be a big target. And that'll do it. I'm tanking.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:14 Oh wow.
Dungeon Master 01:05:36 All righty. Leopold, you're up. Sorry, Elipold, you're up. Sorry, Al, why does it say you're dead?
Leopold Magnus 01:05:39 Yeah, I am going to move a little closer into range. My movement is 30 feet. 30 feet.
Kaladen Shash 01:06:04 I just saw that too. I was going to ask. That was happening. Yes, Cyrus last time, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:06:07 He's had zero HP the whole time. Okay. Very fire. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:10 Well, that was happening with Cyrus as well. Yeah. Okay, so I'm going to cast fire fairy on this creature. Yeah, sorry, fairy fire for my first for my action. And that's just a deck save of 16.
Zariel Torgan 01:06:10 I'm feeling good.
Cyrus Schwert 01:06:14 Yeah, it was. That was mine.
Cletus Cobbington 01:06:24 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:06:38 That is a 14. All righty. All righty. The blow, the low blue flame that's sort of coming off underneath its skin through the flame, sort of turns a purplish hue as it has been marked by fairy fire. The attacks on.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:38 Hope it's not very dexter. Ah, fail. So you guys have advantage. So you guys have advantage.
Cletus Cobbington 01:07:04 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:08 Nice.
Cyrus Schwert 01:07:10 That's awesome.
Kaladen Shash 01:07:12 Does that just stay up or is that concentration? What is that? Okay. If it's a minute, 10 rounds, yeah. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:12 That's concentration up to one minute. And that's six rounds that it stays up, right? Or 10 rounds. Yeah, 10 rounds. Pretty good. Yep. So I will do that as Leopold's action, and then as a bonus action, I'll cast. Magic stick that up. And then since I already set.
Dungeon Master 01:07:16 It is concentration. So you are concentrating. 10 rounds if you can keep it. This magic stone concentration?
Leopold Magnus 01:07:44 I don't think so. Let me double check. Nope. Yep.
Kaladen Shash 01:07:44 No. No. Because you can carry the stones forever. That would stink to those concentration. It's like, and then it just wears off. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:07:47 The cantrip, so it probably isn't. Yes, that's true. Great. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:49 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:55 Yeah, it just cast it and it's there. Yeah, cool. Good looking out. Yeah, so that will be my action and bonus action and then bone crusher, since he was instructed to take up the artillery positions. We'll move into range and cast fire bolts, which has 120 foot range. I think you can move quite a bit.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:22 Because that creature is much closer than 120 feet. Yeah, 25. And that would be with advantage. 25. 25, excellent. So we'll see if fire damage is his weakness, which probably won't be his weakness. Nine, fire damage.
Dungeon Master 01:08:28 Yeah, go ahead and roll to hit. Yes. 25 and 24 hit. Nine. You see it hits and it seems to have an impact, but not as much of an impact as you would like.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:59 Excellent. Good to know. And that's my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:09:04 Awesome, Cleetus, you're up next. You are also concentrating. He's, his mouth is moving, but he's not talking.
Cyrus Schwert 01:09:22 I can't hear you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:09:26 my bad um yes concentration i don't i can't really cast anything because i would break my birdies so even though it doesn't count as an action i'll just use it to tell my birds to go attack on either side on their turn 60 flying speed
Zariel Torgan 01:09:38 Now,
Dungeon Master 01:09:47 Okay. Immediately after, it is their turn. What is their movement? Perfect. It's 50 feet in a line, so 60 feet would get them, I could say, that'll get them into the range of this fire spirit. They fly up to either side. Go ahead and make your text. Each of them, as they get within five feet,
Cletus Cobbington 01:10:04 If they could be on like either side of it. Um. Ouch. My opinion.
Dungeon Master 01:10:16 of this bird instantly start feeling the heat just radiating off of its body they take a d6 of damage two fire damage to each of them
Cletus Cobbington 01:10:33 Okay, they're both. Cool. Okay. Okay, so they both take two attacks. Is there an efficient way to roll four dice right now? Because I don't want them to...
Dungeon Master 01:10:51 You could do slash roll and then do 4D 20 or you could do slash roll. Well, do you want to do it all at once? Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:11:02 like add together is what I'm saying. Well, yes, but both of them have two attacks, so that would be eight D20s, right? So is there an efficient way to do that?
Cyrus Schwert 01:11:05 Probably not. Four or not.
Kaladen Shash 01:11:07 Right, so they'll add together if you say just roll D420. So, but if you ask, you can do two with advantage if you're just rolling off your feet. That's what you're trying to do. Or you're just trying to do, it's like two attacks with advantage, right? Oh, four attacks is what you're rolling. Yeah. There is, you can write...
Cletus Cobbington 01:11:33 Okay, I'll just use real. Okay. So I just do all eight at the same time.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:33 When I was doing that, I would just... Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, I just say, this pair, the best of this pair, the best of this pair, and you can just see them as they land. I mean, that's what I did, but you can do it however you want.
Dungeon Master 01:11:34 Not really.
Kaladen Shash 01:11:36 You can see there's code that you can follow down there. But I would, yeah, do it. Jesse said he would just roll 8D20 and take the pairs and just look at high, low. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:11:50 They could probably understand. There's a button on the left. There's a button on the left of the screen where there's just,
Cletus Cobbington 01:12:02 Okay, what's happening? Okay, it rolled. Wait, what the hell? Why did it do that? I don't know how to roll this many dice, guys. I know it... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Buck it... That's a lot of D20.
Dungeon Master 01:12:16 So that'll be... So that'll be... First one is 22. Second one is 19. Third one is 17. Fourth one is 18. Sorry, 19.
Cyrus Schwert 01:12:20 the little dice icon, you just click, I just do that. He did 92 damage.
Cletus Cobbington 01:12:31 Okay. Okay. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:12:48 All of those hit. So that'll be... You can rule the whole thing at once. You can do slash R space 4D4 plus 4 plus...
Cletus Cobbington 01:12:51 Cool. And they all had plus four as well. The damage will be a little easier. So they both each take a beacon, a talent attack. So 2D4 plus 2.
Cyrus Schwert 01:12:52 Is there an efficient way to rule so much damage? I think he didn't know.
Dungeon Master 01:13:17 That eight, two times four, because they, oh, they only two, it plus four. So 2D4 plus four plus 46 plus four. And you can roll all of that at once. 29 damage.
Cletus Cobbington 01:13:21 cool okay okay oh okay oh that looked fun 29 damage from the bird
Zariel Torgan 01:13:32 This is the best part of E&D is just the math. Nice. Hot damn.
Cyrus Schwert 01:13:37 The big bird hit the bird.
Dungeon Master 01:13:52 A big hit on it. Up next is Zareal. One, two steps sort of into the circle. One, two, steps sort of into the circle, there's nothing.
Cletus Cobbington 01:13:54 Cool. It took a lot.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:59 Alright, I can't do much, but... What can I do? I'm gonna move over here. Is there anything I can find cover behind? Or is it pretty much all open? Okay, all right, that's fine. I'm just gonna go ahead and
Zariel Torgan 01:14:28 take my movement, which is 30, just to get over here. Right about there. And then I'm going to, uh, since I can't use a concentration, the only thing I can get that's going to reach from here is a sacred flame. So it's going to be a deck save as I reach out my hands and these
Cyrus Schwert 01:14:49 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:57 this big orb of radiant light shoots forth. Alright, that is a failure. So I will roll 2D8 radiant damage. That's 13 points of radiant damage. And then bonus action, I'll just...
Dungeon Master 01:15:03 That is a six. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:26 Chill. That's all I got. I'm gonna mark these two turkey vultures.
Dungeon Master 01:15:32 Last for that least, it is the fire spirit. I'll make it quick. It is just going to attack the vulture on top because those are the ones hearing it the most. First attack, it can do... It'll be 29 to hit. And...
Kaladen Shash 01:15:57 No? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:16:03 Maybe 15. And did take... That is 56 points of damage total. On the top one.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:08 It's 15 hit. This 15 hit. Grace.
Cletus Cobbington 01:16:34 Sorry, I was facing out. Fuck! I didn't want to hear it. I'm sorry. How much damage? He's dead. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Dungeon Master 01:16:36 56 in total to the top one. Okay, that was its turn, though. After that, it is Caledon.
Cyrus Schwert 01:16:37 We fucked up your bird, dude.
Kaladen Shash 01:16:38 Yeah. I will move, I think I need before just a little bit.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:40 Ha ha ha ha.
Kaladen Shash 01:17:06 Yeah, I'm 35 feet. I'm going to move forward just a little bit and I'm going to activate my arc slash charge for the day and take two ranged attacks with light splitter. What is super advantage? Is that a new rule?
Dungeon Master 01:17:20 Go for it. I don't know what that is. That's nothing. That's nothing. That's just there all of a sudden.
Kaladen Shash 01:17:35 Was it like house rule? You saw that too? Yeah. What is this? What is this? Roll. And roll. What's that happen?
Dungeon Master 01:18:07 What you doing? Uh, 28 hits. Napo 20 hits. That number three?
Kaladen Shash 01:18:08 I'm just trying to roll. There it goes. They're just like doing nothing for like a minute and a half. First one. Yep. And then second. Oof, net 20. I'm full of those tonight, man. So that's number three. I want to roll. So it'll be.
Cletus Cobbington 01:18:26 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:18:38 Everything doubled on one of them plus a regular. Okay. So it's going to be 3D10 because 2D10 and a 1D10 plus 2D8.
Dungeon Master 01:18:41 Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:19:07 plus 2d6 okay a number coming in for 32 and i will then use
Dungeon Master 01:19:18 32 points of damage. Showing visible wear in here. Your two slashes go searing through the air, these like explosions of light that go in sort of a crescent arc, both hit it at sort of the base of one of its large wings, and you hear a sickening snap as the bird wing snaps in place, and it looks like it almost loses the ability to fly as it lets up this huge howling squaw.
Dungeon Master 01:19:47 nasty hit. You're welcome. Okay. Okay. After that it is infernate.
Cletus Cobbington 01:19:51 Can we hear that clock? Sorry. Thank you. Oh, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:19:51 And I'm going to use it. That sounds like pure agony. I'm going to use the rest of my movement to kind of tuck over here, so we're all not in one line. Ready good. Keep going.
Cyrus Schwert 01:20:16 Inferneem's going to get into the mix with this big fucking bird. And I'm just going to try to fist this bird a couple times. Oh, it's with the advantage still, right? Okay. Okay. This is plus nine.
Cletus Cobbington 01:20:29 Big monkey punch.
Dungeon Master 01:20:33 Yes, it's still under a ferry fire. You take five points of fire damage as you enter in its space. You didn't? 18-hap. Brian? Brian, what were you saying?
Kaladen Shash 01:20:42 Jonathan, I didn't, I didn't add. I didn't add my modifier to the original D10 rolls. So it would have been 21 more damage. So it would have been 503. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:20:45 Oh, shoot. So 18. I did a wrong. Go let a rock. I'm just going to do it the same way because it's faster. 18 hits. Wow.
Dungeon Master 01:21:07 Okay. Heavier hit. Roll your damage, yeah. Both hit.
Cletus Cobbington 01:21:11 Yeah, I didn't roll my D-100s either, so
Kaladen Shash 01:21:12 Heavy hit, sweet hit. Did that go through the vultures? Yeah, yes.
Cyrus Schwert 01:21:19 So I hit twice. I got 19 on the second one. This is plus 12. Damn. He fit this bird. Fuck this bird up. I hit it for 54. Fuck you, bird.
Dungeon Master 01:21:39 42 plus 12. How does Inhernape incapacitate, not outright kill, but how do you put this bird down for a second in an impressive way?
Kaladen Shash 01:21:42 Oh, good.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:45 Jesus.
Cletus Cobbington 01:21:48 Jesus Christ.
Cyrus Schwert 01:21:52 Shut up. I fucking grab it like I'm arresting him and I grab his wings and I put him on his back like I'm putting handcuffs on him. Just snap them fuckers. You have the right turn me in silence.
Dungeon Master 01:22:12 You spin it around and you see it's fighting and just letting out these loud noises. You feel its body is physically getting hotter in all of the magma and lava around you sort of is bubbling and moving. And as you snap its other wing behind, it lets up this horrendous squeak before. I need you to give me a strength-saving throw.
Cyrus Schwert 01:22:34 OK. So on this monkey, Abe, there's a puss. OK. So just all I see is the check. I don't know how it's work. OK. OK. All I see is the check. All right.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:40 Plus five. Oh, I save is probably more. Okay. So yeah, probably plus five.
Dungeon Master 01:22:51 If it's not proficient, then it doesn't get an extra thing. It'll say savings or strength if it is. Cool. Four, nine. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:23:03 That picture looks sick as fuck. Remember you can't talk?
Cyrus Schwert 01:23:07 The birds wake cooler now. A nine.
Dungeon Master 01:23:14 It explodes in this just like bomb, this nuclear thing goes off right in front of you. And the giant ape is thrown 30 feet back. You slam into the wall behind, cracking a huge piece of stone breaks off and almost block the path as the fire spirit erupts into full flame. And he will be same initiative that he won't live up.
Cletus Cobbington 01:23:41 Way to piss him off, Cyrus.
Cyrus Schwert 01:23:42 Did I take damage? I tried to arrest him. Yeah. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:23:42 I think pass without a trace is still up, right? Sweet music, by the way.
Kaladen Shash 01:23:44 We're walking them up now.
Dungeon Master 01:24:03 Thanks. No, no damage on that. After that is Leopold's turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:12 you're muted oh there you go
Leopold Magnus 01:24:16 Well, oh, that was quite the sight. I don't know if you read him as Miranda writes, but I guess I can't complain too much because you really laid him up. And I'm going to get in there. Is it on the ground now?
Kaladen Shash 01:24:25 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:24:35 it's still like the nest exploded in front so all the trees everything is just level with the ground so it is ground level but hasn't moved from its spot but there's like an easily accessible way up now
Cyrus Schwert 01:24:38 Thank you. Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:24:40 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:24:48 Got it. Okay. So it's on an elevated platform, though, right? Uh. Oh, Jesus. Okay. All right.
Dungeon Master 01:25:00 No, it was. If it's like, if it was like 20 feet in the air, that is exploded and it's sort of rested to ground level. But it is in itself like 60 feet tall. So it takes up a lot of it.
Leopold Magnus 01:25:14 Uh, that sounds good. I guess what I will do since I know that I'll take damage if I enter it space is hang back. And I will just, um, cast, well, I won't even cast anything right now. I'll just use my hand crossbow and I'll try and launch a couple bolts at them. Uh, but I have advantage.
Dungeon Master 01:25:36 Going roll to hit. Is there a Dave from Ferry Fire, a 23 hits?
Leopold Magnus 01:25:42 uh so 23 to hit uh no not to my understand let me reread it just so i make sure uh it's in a 20-foot cube gets outlined if the creature's in that area when i cast a spell
Leopold Magnus 01:26:08 and fails the deck saving throw for the duration objects and affected creatures shed a dim light and a 10 foot radius any attack roll against the affected creature object has advantage if the attacker can see it and the affected creature object can't benefit for being invisible so i can't last for a full minute yep yeah unless i break concentration yeah
Dungeon Master 01:26:27 unless you break concentration. Okay. 10 damage.
Kaladen Shash 01:26:27 as long as you're, right.
Leopold Magnus 01:26:33 Cool. That's very advantageous. Okay, so that was one. Roll the damage on that. 10 damage on that one bolt. 15 to hit on the second one bolt. Oh, wow, okay. I thought a little lower.
Dungeon Master 01:26:57 15 just hits. Wow.
Leopold Magnus 01:27:04 12 damage, max damage on that second one. So I'm just, and then the arm cocks back, launches another one. And then while Leopold's kind of preoccupied with loading his arm bolt loader, one of the stones stops floating around him and just lasers in on the bird and it goes flying.
Kaladen Shash 01:27:07 Come on, good wine.
Dungeon Master 01:27:28 One roll to hit. Nicely done.
Cyrus Schwert 01:27:29 Thanks.
Leopold Magnus 01:27:35 Oh shit, I keep forgetting out of advantage. 18 will hit. Okay, 18 hits. Oh, 11 damage. Another max damage on that stone, just obliterating this bird. Ill defender.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:54 Yeah. Rocked.
Dungeon Master 01:28:00 nine, good news.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:04 I think he has, how's this movement? How far away from the bird is he? Let's see. 20 feet, I think he can move 20 feet, no problem. So he's gonna get up there.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:21 And you normally see him move kind of mechanically and slowly and stiff. This time you see him running at a full sprint and quite impressive. And he takes a lunging slash with his force-empowered rend.
Dungeon Master 01:28:40 Nice. As soon as he enters 10 feet of the spirit, he takes four fire damage, and you guys see bone pressure. He doesn't catch fire like traditionally, but you see he starts radiating. His metal starts getting red. He is technically on fire until he is doubt somehow.
Leopold Magnus 01:29:02 Okay, nice. Four points of damage. And I can't be put out. Ah, I see. Got it. Okay. But that force empowered rend will be a...
Kaladen Shash 01:29:02 Oh, but it's tough. Right. Not until water hits here.
Dungeon Master 01:29:05 So he'll take the 10 damage at the start of each of his terms until he doesn't know. And he does four damage. Well, I mean, you can use your action to douse yourself or somebody else can douse you. 24 hits.
Zariel Torgan 01:29:25 Hello. Hello.
Leopold Magnus 01:29:29 Nice, 24 to hit. That'll hit. Hey, not too bad. Another eight damage.
Dungeon Master 01:29:41 After that, the spirit's going to use two legendary actions and do its wing attack. The turkey vulture and the steel defender give me a dexterity saving throw.
Cletus Cobbington 01:30:06 Would that just be based on my saving throw? Oh, plus zero. OK, so just to 15.
Dungeon Master 01:30:11 No, it should have a deck safe. Both fail. You both take 15 points of bludgeoning damage, the bird is not prone and steel defender is not prone.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:26 16 on my end. 15 points. Ouch.
Cletus Cobbington 01:30:39 Oh, no. All right. Um... The bird would have to do its, like, action to get up, right? Is that how that works with the drone? Oh, okay. Um, well, in that case...
Dungeon Master 01:30:45 After that, it is Cletus' turn. Half its movement.
Cletus Cobbington 01:31:10 I don't have any spells that do too much. So I'll do a bonus action, and I'm going to conjure a hound dog totem, like right in the middle to where it has a 30-foot radius. I want to try and get all four the homies in it if I can, if not, at least Cyrus Ariel and Leopold.
Cletus Cobbington 01:31:38 And when you're inside the radius, it's the spirit totem. I flavored as a hound dog, but it's technically the bear mode. Everyone inside it has 13 temp hit points and advantage on strength checks and saves. It's within the radius.
Dungeon Master 01:31:38 What is this? Sorry. Yeah. You can't get them right away.
Kaladen Shash 01:31:53 If we leave the area to our 10 points drop. Okay, cool, cool. It's not bad.
Leopold Magnus 01:32:00 If you go in and out to those come back.
Dungeon Master 01:32:03 You can get two, but it's just barely not tall enough to get both Leopold and Zario. Minimal distance has to be moved.
Cletus Cobbington 01:32:14 Gotcha. I mean, let's lean it towards Leopold's side, I guess. OK. All right. That'll do that'll do that.
Zariel Torgan 01:32:14 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:32:39 Okay. After the song isn't fitting. After your turn, it is your vulture's turn. Yeah. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:32:46 all right uh you'll use some movement get back up from prone and then take its two attacks so that would just be that that's how that works right okay uh bird shrivels up to fiery dust
Dungeon Master 01:33:06 He'll take five fire damage as soon as he gets back up and do its base. You can get your attacks off at the same time, though. So he'll die at the end of his turn, but he takes the damage, catches fire, and dies. Yeah, the fire spirit hasn't moved.
Cletus Cobbington 01:33:18 Okay. Worth it. So they still have advantage, correct? Okay. Let me do this again. And they have plus four on these. So 18 and what, 21?
Zariel Torgan 01:33:25 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:33:34 Throken concentration yet. Yeah. Yeah, both hit.
Cletus Cobbington 01:33:52 All right, so then 12 damage. And then he poofs into a little smoke bowl. All right. Yeah, Chris, crispy.
Dungeon Master 01:34:10 It's the turkey from National Lampons Christmas. Just double-drawn. After that, it's all.
Leopold Magnus 01:34:15 Say the blessing.
Zariel Torgan 01:34:22 all right i i think i want to let's see i want to i want to i want to and i should just do this instead
Zariel Torgan 01:34:49 Yeah, I'm going to cast fire shield on myself. But instead of a fire shield, I'm going to use chill shield. And so this icy semi-translucent shield just starts floating in front of me. And it'll give me resistance to fire damage. And then I'm going to move.
Cletus Cobbington 01:34:55 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:35:03 Okay. Is that concentration or not? Nice.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:19 no actually it's not that's why i'm that's why i'm trying to i'm trying to find something i can do that you know so i'm just gonna get right to 10 feet away from it um or a little further away i'm gonna move until i feel like heat and then and then back up a little bit that way i don't take the damage and then i'll actually i'll move over here i'll move over here that way i'm in the thing
Dungeon Master 01:35:39 Okay. Okay. Um, after your turn, it is the fire spirit's turn. You see it's,
Zariel Torgan 01:35:45 and uh bonus action i don't have any bonus sections so that's it
Dungeon Master 01:36:02 uh ruffles its flaming feathers uh taking damage taking notice but doesn't look like it is hurting yet it'll move down a little bit to get into the business of making a nice line for itself and it will use its fire beam attack
Dungeon Master 01:36:23 You see it starts choking almost like it's on a hairball kind of deal. And you see like flaming magnets like spouting out of its beak. And then it like opens his mouth all the way. You see this jet stream of flame. That is a, it is a 10 foot wide, 100 foot line. So it'll get the Steel Defender, Zareal, the Giant A.
Cletus Cobbington 01:36:45 Jesus.
Kaladen Shash 01:36:45 Nifty. Four people very easy. Yeah. Some people have advantage to.
Zariel Torgan 01:36:46 Jesus. Damn. The deck say. Oh, fuck me.
Dungeon Master 01:36:53 and Cletus as the line tears down the center, I need everybody in that area to give a dexterity saving throw. Dexterity save you.
Leopold Magnus 01:37:07 Oh, boy. Still the fender's probably going to be.
Cyrus Schwert 01:37:08 Did you say deck? That's a concentration so for Cyrus. So I can't imagine I'm still with the monkey.
Kaladen Shash 01:37:14 Ariel, you still have advantage, right? Oh, no, no, no. It's a Cyrus. Who else got it in? No, you're an ape. Yeah, you're dropping it. Well, we let the druids hold, didn't we let druids hold concentration on a spell they cast? Well, Jews can have their own intelligent blogs. Yeah, oh, fair enough, fair enough.
Cletus Cobbington 01:37:21 Yeah, that's gone. No, you're an ape. Oh, fuck. We rolled so bad. We rolled so bad.
Dungeon Master 01:37:36 That's because it's wild shape, not polymorph. Still the vendor takes 64 points of fire damage.
Leopold Magnus 01:37:43 Steel defender with an aid on the deck save. A steel defender explodes into a like basically pressure cooker bomb of springs and parts and pieces. Yeah, maybe some shrapnel damages other people. Leopold yells, bone crusher. And an arm goes and Leopold grabs a hold of it.
Kaladen Shash 01:37:51 It just. Just.
Cyrus Schwert 01:37:59 Oh, God. There we go. I said I might have right. It's okay. Cyrus gets an 11. Do I imagine I think it to probably? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:38:04 You see the metal parts start like shaking. Yeah. Yeah, you take 64 points. Yeah, you take 64 points of fire damage.
Cletus Cobbington 01:38:12 Jesus Christ. I didn't like that. I didn't like that one bit, actually.
Cyrus Schwert 01:38:31 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:38:37 64 points. Oh my god. One hit.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:38 As a matter of fact, I didn't. Was that all?
Dungeon Master 01:38:41 uh what did cleetus get a four yeah okay uh and that is all it can do on its turn uh start of the round caledon your turn
Kaladen Shash 01:38:56 What, what, what? I'm gonna. Uh, I'm gonna.
Dungeon Master 01:38:56 So, Cowden, from your angle, you saw this an explosion of fire and magma speed. And, like, at the very core, there was, like, this theme, just like Godzilla breath almost, hitting the center. The ground is carved away in, like, a circular arc on the floor as this huge explosion goes.
Kaladen Shash 01:39:23 I'm going to just use all my economy to just make attacks. I'm going to send one bolt of the sopric blast at it. Is it advantage still up on the fairy fire? Leopold you were out of it. Okay, sweet.
Leopold Magnus 01:39:23 Yeah. Yeah, attrition yet.
Dungeon Master 01:39:44 Yeah. Jesse did polymorph stares it dropped. Half of 64 is 30. You fire resistance tonight. Yeah. Good use.
Zariel Torgan 01:39:52 It stayed. I've got Warcaster, and so I rolled advantage, and I got a 22 on my save. I have... Yeah, but I... I have fire resistance. Yeah, that was perfect timing on that. So the apes still up. My question was going to be the temp hit points from that aura thing. Does the fire damage burn through that first and then cut through me, or since it
Kaladen Shash 01:40:12 Oh, sorry, that was weird. Uh, trying, then two attacks looked like the two arc slashes hit again.
Cletus Cobbington 01:40:17 Mm-hmm. It's smelling like roast beef back here.
Dungeon Master 01:40:17 And then HP, yeah. Yeah. Nice.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:23 Okay, so I got to add, I got to add 13 back. Okay. All right, perfect. Thank you. Uh, huh, uh, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Leopold Magnus 01:40:27 Yeah, that was pretty solid.
Kaladen Shash 01:40:48 Oh, I don't know why that didn't go. That's not right, that 43 shouldn't be on there. That was supposed to be 2D6. I don't know why it was 43. So John, then it'll be 15 plus 2D6 here. That's pretty good. Just leave that. Oh, there you go, plus 8 more. So 23 damage.
Cyrus Schwert 01:40:54 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:40:54 forward to me.
Leopold Magnus 01:40:56 Beef, it's what's for dinner.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:00 I'd just leave it. Eh. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Nice.
Kaladen Shash 01:41:20 You guys, watch out for that fire breath. It looks pretty bad.
Dungeon Master 01:41:26 At the end of your turn, it's going to use a legendary action to move 30 feet as it sort of hopped into the center of everybody. And it is Cyrus's turn. Yeah, the start of your turn, you take a D10 of damage. Just as you get close to a heated body.
Cletus Cobbington 01:41:40 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:41:44 You got in the mix with all of this? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:41:45 Wait. Wasn't it just calitons?
Kaladen Shash 01:41:50 Or just from being close to the flame. Dang.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:53 Is... Um... Is the Orica on now, though? Oh, sweet. Okay, cool. All right.
Dungeon Master 01:41:56 uh six points to the giant ape and you are on fire did cletus oh yeah well no that's not concentration that's just an ability
Cletus Cobbington 01:42:13 No, it just exists. Until I die or after a minute.
Leopold Magnus 01:42:17 That's pretty good.
Cyrus Schwert 01:42:23 Okay, I'll try to fist this bird again. Fuck you, bird. I fucking hate you. Does it say a number? It looks like blank. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:42:29 The Giant Age says. I see 13. Okay, well, Travis gets to be the one to roll.
Kaladen Shash 01:42:31 They just bang on it. It says blank. I saw the roll.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:34 Eat him. You always hate to see it. You hate to see it. It lets me roll. I rolled a 27 with that. I clicked on his message thing.
Cletus Cobbington 01:42:50 or just click on it or just click on it on the chat
Leopold Magnus 01:42:52 What? Yeah, what did you just do? That's great. That's great. Yeah, you do advantage.
Cyrus Schwert 01:42:54 Done of a bit. Oh, whatever. Oh, there we go. Oh, there we go. Oh, should I have advantage. Be if I crit. It did not.
Kaladen Shash 01:42:56 Yeah, they clicked the button. I saw, yeah, his button was, oh, because he's making messages instead of. Oh, that's funny, you're doing chats. Yeah, because now your chats are what you need to roll. Yeah. Dang. 3020. Do it.
Dungeon Master 01:42:58 Oh, it's slash R, not R slash. 20 hits.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:09 Yeah, it works. You have advantage.
Dungeon Master 01:43:26 26 hits. You have two attacks, though, both with advantage. 12 misses. Always rolling. 28, 28 hits. Nice.
Cyrus Schwert 01:43:32 Okay. Oh, yeah. There's a second one. It's so long. With advantage, the 28. So two heads.
Leopold Magnus 01:43:34 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:51 Oh, close.
Cletus Cobbington 01:43:55 Damn. We're on a D20 for damages, nuts. Oh, gotcha. Oh, yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:44:02 No, that was just my advantage to my attack. So this is it plus 12 for both attacks combined. Another 44 damage to the homie. Adventure. And
Dungeon Master 01:44:02 It's not. That's just what it lists it as. 44 damage.
Kaladen Shash 01:44:14 gnargs,
Leopold Magnus 01:44:16 Nice.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:22 hitting him.
Cyrus Schwert 01:44:31 I don't want the opportunity to attack. I'll just chill right there. I guess. No.
Cletus Cobbington 01:44:35 Like Caesar and Planet of the Apes. No.
Dungeon Master 01:44:35 Okay. After your turn, it's going to use another legendary action and take a tail attack at you. Just basically hits you with a bludgeoning force. It was supposed to be fired when they changed it. You take, if it hits, that is 30-30 to hit.
Kaladen Shash 01:45:02 Yeah. Oh, yeah, no, wait, wait, don't miss it. Oh, wow, wait. Oh, that's that, man.
Cyrus Schwert 01:45:02 Yeah, that'll do it. Yeah. I'm pretty sure. Let me check the stats. How many? Twenty-two. Okay. When do you go down in polymorph if I become myself, right? Right on. It's like, um...
Leopold Magnus 01:45:03 Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:45:08 You take 22 points of damage. 22. Yeah. Leopold is up.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:09 Day. Pretty quick. Still up. Still up. Yeah. Polymorph kicks ass.
Cletus Cobbington 01:45:14 22.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:32 All right. This bird's now in my space. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:45:38 Yes, so you take a D10 of the damage, and you are on fire. You take five points of fine damage. Yeah, he is the exact same as a steel defender. He's just getting really bright red.
Kaladen Shash 01:45:44 Can you be on fire? I guess he's just heating up. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:57 Okay, what's the concentration? Okay, so DC10, so I just roll the D20. Sorry, say it again. Got it. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:46:09 It's DC10 or half the damage, whichever is higher. Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty cool. Six, you fail. What were you concentrating on? Fire drop.
Kaladen Shash 01:46:15 It's the chat told them. It's pretty fun. Like whenever that was that huge fire blast, it's like 32 save. Failed. No. Drops it. No add to that. Free fire.
Leopold Magnus 01:46:23 Oh, so I guess, well, is there any, yeah, so there's no add to that. Damn. Yep. Uh, fairy fire, yeah. Um, but we are. Okay. So, it's an ax. Have advanced.
Dungeon Master 01:46:43 unfortunately. Yes, you are all sort of flanking at this point anyway. Arranged won't, so Talden won't benefit from the flanking, but anybody up close will.
Leopold Magnus 01:46:54 D8 plus six, okay. Right. So I'll take a strike with my searing saber. Oh, baby, not 20. I think it's my first, but yeah, there's been a lot out there.
Dungeon Master 01:47:12 That's the 20. Obviously. That's the fifth Nat 20 of the night. Fifth total. Yeah, your first. Go and roll damage.
Leopold Magnus 01:47:29 Okay, so that's for one. So I'll double that and roll another one. Nice. And then... Come on. There's the other one. There it is. Five. So eight fire damage. I know that's separate. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And then... 20... Yeah. So four plus 24, 28.
Dungeon Master 01:47:47 4, 27, 32. Oh, and the fire is half. So 32 minus 48. Oh, shit. Sorry. When it was in its other form, it took half fire damage. In this form, you see that it doesn't seem to take any fire damage.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:03 Nice, 28 damage on that slash. That's pretty good. Ah, that's a bummer. All right. But I will take that other swing. I'm to pop.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:16 Mm. Ouch.
Cyrus Schwert 01:48:18 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:48:20 takes to make forward.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:33 Oh, damn, dude. Let's say, so, crit damage. I guess this crit, when I do it on D&D beyond, just crit damage, roll it the proper way. All right, so I'll just roll twice. Yeah. So that's one, so that's one slash.
Dungeon Master 01:48:51 No, it doesn't double your modifier, it doubles your dice. 19 more damage.
Kaladen Shash 01:48:54 Yeah, so you can just type in your double. Yeah. That's great.
Leopold Magnus 01:49:06 19 damage on that next swing. Yeah. That was like 45 damage on just an action. So then I will, I got two more stones flying around here, I think. Maybe.
Leopold Magnus 01:49:30 Yeah, I think I had two more. But I'm within close range. So this would be with disadvantage if it's arranged. OK. So that's not flat, because range doesn't benefit from advantage. So I'll go ahead and burn through a stone as a bonus action.
Dungeon Master 01:49:40 Yeah. Just sort of dissolve as it gets too close to its body. Awesome. At the end of your turn, it'll use a...
Cletus Cobbington 01:50:01 Thanks.
Leopold Magnus 01:50:03 And that's my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:50:10 Legendary action to take it, last legendary action in the round, you take another attack at you. It'll do its beak attack. That is 26 to hit. Does that hit Leopold?
Leopold Magnus 01:50:35 yes uh that would that would hit 27 points it was 13 temporary hit okay so i'll just subtract that so i'll take 14
Cyrus Schwert 01:50:36 Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:50:42 Beiapult takes 27 points of piercing damage. Nice. And then it's Cletus's turn.
Kaladen Shash 01:50:54 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:51:18 I can't hear you, sir.
Cletus Cobbington 01:51:24 Okay, there you go. I'm gonna, first of all, bonus action, third level healing word myself, because I'm mega fucked up. And hopefully I roll semi-decently. Not really, a lot of ones. Awesome. Okay. Epic.
Kaladen Shash 01:51:35 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:41 Nice Oh, bummer.
Cletus Cobbington 01:51:50 I'm a little bit less roasted. Then I'm going to do my main thing at this point, a little fourth level moonbeams straight on this fucker's head, which would be a constitution save. I think just you.
Dungeon Master 01:52:10 Did everybody just lose connection, or is that just me? Okay, I lost connection. I saw that you healed yourself, but nothing else. Okay, and Moonbeam is a concave?
Cyrus Schwert 01:52:12 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:52:21 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:52:21 Thanks, just you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:52:24 I did bonus action healing word and then cast moonbeams straight on his head. Con save. Yeah, Con save 15. No. Disad advantage, right? Oh, okay. So half this.
Dungeon Master 01:52:42 Sorry, 17 plus 9, 26. 26. Nice.
Cletus Cobbington 01:52:54 Please. Oh, no. OK, 26. So 12 or 13 damage. Yeah. That'll I don't know if I really want to move. I'm just going to die. So I'm just going to stay there, I think. Yeah, let's see. I move like right there.
Cyrus Schwert 01:53:13 He might want to move out of line with the big monkey just in case.
Cletus Cobbington 01:53:22 I'm just going to hide behind this. Yeah. That'll do me.
Dungeon Master 01:53:34 That will do you. Okay, at the end of your turn, it is its turn. Roll to see if it's, yes? Oh, it is your turn. Yes, it is your turn. Yes, it is. Sorry. Zoriel's turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:44 Um, I think, I think, I think, I think it's me. All right. I would like to, yeah, if you miss your own turn, you might be, have worse problem. Uh, I'm gonna do a bonus action healing word on Cletus, third level.
Cletus Cobbington 01:53:57 Way to pay attention.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:14 So let's see if we get anything good on that. Okay. All right. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:54:18 You also take, just to start your turn, just like everybody else, five points of fire damage and you are on fire. Or heating up, if you want to frame it down. Yeah, you can't heal up through to tap HP. It's just once it's gone, it's dim in it. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:54:27 Does the temp HP once it's gone, it's gone forever, or does that like regenerate from the totem? Right. So it's just a one, okay. Oh, 17. Yes, I did graciously.
Kaladen Shash 01:54:35 Each round. You took all of it.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:46 All right, and then Cletus, did you take that, did you take that healing? Okay, yeah. All right, and then I'm going to turn into a saber-tooth tiger with my action, and I'm going to use my movement to walk 15 feet away and 15 feet back and try to draw a opportunity attack.
Cyrus Schwert 01:55:15 Did you attack it first? I got it first. Got it.
Dungeon Master 01:55:23 Sorry, you're trying to draw an opportunity attack? You do you realize it's next, though, so it would get its reaction back, no matter what?
Zariel Torgan 01:55:27 Uh, yeah. I mean, if it wants to, it doesn't have to, obviously. It's up to the creature, but, you know. No, I can't. I use my action to, uh, shape change.
Cletus Cobbington 01:55:44 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:55:47 Right at top of the order.
Dungeon Master 01:55:51 Yeah. So do you want to risk getting hit for no reason? Okay. Okay. You got it. 17 to hit.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:56 So I have the chill shield, which does 2D8 cold damage every time I'm attacked. And I wild-shaped, my AC would be lower, so I'd get hit more. So I just want to take as many hits as possible. But, I mean, he doesn't have to hit me. I could move, and it could just be like, I'll get you later, you know. Oh, that was my thought. Oh, yeah. Let me double check that I'm almost positive. It's like nothing.
Cyrus Schwert 01:56:03 Hmm. I'll get you later. I'll get you later.
Kaladen Shash 01:56:26 It's like 13 always or 12. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:56:27 I think it's 12. Sabershoot Tiger take 22 points of slashing damage.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:27 Yeah, yeah, it's like 12. So that hits. All right. And then it takes. Let's get down to it. It takes 2D8. It's going to say fire, but it's really cold.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:56 So that's going to be 14. Terrible. That was my whole plan. All right. That works.
Dungeon Master 01:56:56 It'll take half as it's greasy scinticold. It takes seven then. It's not that bad. I don't think terrible. It's green, which means it's above average.
Cletus Cobbington 01:57:05 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:57:17 You see you fire off your cold shield tries to deflect, and it just sort of evaporates as it hits, and it's just not having as much of a purpose as you would like it to have. But you take that attack, you take the damage, it does a little bit to it. At the start of its turn, roll the steep. Oh, yeah, I got the moonbeam. A con save.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:30 Okay. Okay. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:57:37 On saving throw. Come on. Come on. Roll bad. I want you to roll bad. That's not that bad. OK, half this. 11.
Kaladen Shash 01:57:53 That big bonus.
Dungeon Master 01:57:54 No, that is a 30-20. 11 points of damage. It's round down always, just to keep it easy.
Cyrus Schwert 01:58:12 Do you round up or down?
Cletus Cobbington 01:58:16 I think.
Zariel Torgan 01:58:16 Up when it hurts him down when it hurts us.
Dungeon Master 01:58:24 It's looking pretty hurt. So 11 is still a good amount. It on its turn rolls to see if it gets its beam back and it does on a 5. Okay. How do I do a lot of damage? Um...
Kaladen Shash 01:58:27 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:58:51 So when I said I wanted you to roll bad, I meant. I was really happy when you rolled that 20. So just saying. He's coming after me, isn't he?
Zariel Torgan 01:58:57 Yeah, I saw that. That's rough. If you can't... Oh, no. He's like, where's the beef?
Dungeon Master 01:58:58 the next
Cletus Cobbington 01:59:24 Y'all better be vegetarians. Don't eat me once I'm dead. I might be delicious. Don't do it. Jesus.
Dungeon Master 01:59:31 Okay, it'll take opportunity attack from both the ape and the saber-tooth tiger, but not Leopold as it sort of jumps over Leopold and then it lets out its enormous beam that'll hit Leo, the ape, Cyrus, and Cletus. Oh, sorry, that's my invisible Cyrus token. It is just the three of you. I had to put them somewhere.
Zariel Torgan 01:59:31 It's going to be some steamed almond milk. Is he still? He's still under...
Kaladen Shash 01:59:39 No, the drop, no advantageous. No, the drop, no advantages. Well, parent, you guys are
Cletus Cobbington 01:59:54 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:00:02 Greyfire, right? Oh, bummer. Oh, I'm gonna... I got all right, I'm gonna roll that with advantage because I got both guys over there.
Dungeon Master 02:00:04 None that dropped. Yeah, from two of them, but it just bliveled around you so you don't get one.
Kaladen Shash 02:00:08 hearing there's still you're still uh
Leopold Magnus 02:00:10 uh didn't move uh enough to take an attack opportunity okay well they can both take them both take uh so i'm rolling on a deck save
Cletus Cobbington 02:00:29 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:00:32 18. 10. 10 slashing damage.
Dungeon Master 02:00:34 18 hits. Yes. And slash 19. 19. You need a 21. That is a failure. Does anybody have a way to buff him?
Kaladen Shash 02:00:42 Mm-hmm. Boyy. Oh, oh. Oh. Saving a saving throw.
Leopold Magnus 02:00:44 That's pretty good. 19. Jesus. Yeah, I don't think there's anything out. Yeah, I don't think there's anything out.
Cletus Cobbington 02:01:05 uh buffing for what
Dungeon Master 02:01:07 I don't understand. Anybody has something. What did the monkey get on an attack of opportunity? Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:01:13 You know, what? This fire damage, right?
Cyrus Schwert 02:01:15 I did not hit. It was like 11. Okay. Let me just roll D20. Okay. No.
Zariel Torgan 02:01:19 You have advantage because I'm harrying with you. I was. I don't have anything I can do as a reaction is the problem. Oof.
Leopold Magnus 02:01:42 Jonathan, I do have a reaction that I'm going to do. I am going to cast absorb elements, which will give me an incoming energy. And not that it's relevant here, but I'll be over 1D6 of that and use it against it.
Dungeon Master 02:01:50 What are you doing? Nice. Nicely done. Yes. Yes, so you'll take half damage. Or do you just reduce it?
Zariel Torgan 02:01:52 What you got? Ooh.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:14 It's a reduction. How does it read? Oh, it read? Oh, it must be nothing.
Leopold Magnus 02:02:17 Yeah, I think it, no, no, it says you gain resistance. So you capture some of the incoming energy, and then you have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. And then the first time you're hit with it, you get a melee, you take 1D6 damage of the triggering damage, which is why it rolled that for, because it takes four fire damage, but that's not going to be relevant.
Dungeon Master 02:02:45 Yeah, it does. Love that. Okay. Yeah, you were resistant. Okay, so if you, so Cletus, that's, did you make your deck save? 64 points of your...
Cletus Cobbington 02:02:59 Oh, my bad. Oh, not one. Nice. Oh, I'm just so traumatized by this fire already.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:02 You want over a 21.
Kaladen Shash 02:03:06 Goodness. He's down. He is just downed.
Leopold Magnus 02:03:07 Yike. Barbecue tonight.
Cyrus Schwert 02:03:08 Trips getting out of the way. It was a while ago, but it was much less than a 21.
Dungeon Master 02:03:14 Letus goes down. What did the giant ape get on its deck save? 64 points of fire damage. What did the Saber 2 Tiger get? Oh, you weren't in it. Yeah, you're good. And then Leopold takes half.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:35 Oh, I wasn't in the beam.
Leopold Magnus 02:03:39 64 points. Okay, so I take 32 then. Yikes. That kept me up.
Dungeon Master 02:03:44 Take 32. And that's all it does. Start of the round of this Caledon. Cletus has gone down. Is the monkey looking pretty hurt?
Cyrus Schwert 02:03:57 I'm pretty hurt for sure.
Cletus Cobbington 02:04:02 I'm looking a good medium rare.
Kaladen Shash 02:04:04 I'm going to I'm going to cast this softrick blast because it's got a long range with a dirty 20 to hit and then one force damage
Zariel Torgan 02:04:17 It arcs is
Dungeon Master 02:04:22 320 hits.
Leopold Magnus 02:04:29 Oh, no. It just kind of poops out. Fizzles. Makes a little kazoo noise.
Kaladen Shash 02:04:34 Watch out, guys. That's awesome. But then I'm just going to shift sideways so that I can get within 30 feet. And then I'll cast, or not cast, I'll use two of the arc flash attacks again with.
Cletus Cobbington 02:04:36 Welcome to the club.
Kaladen Shash 02:05:04 light splitter. First one's going to be a 29 to hit. And second one is going to be a 29 to hit. Two, two, six.
Dungeon Master 02:05:14 29 hits. 28 hits.
Kaladen Shash 02:05:41 Jonathan, with one of my feats, it's like great weapon master or something. Is it ones and twos that can re-roll on damage? Is that the rule on that one? Yeah. I rolled three twos. I'm just going to do a D-10 and 2s. I'm just going to do a D-10 and 2D-6s again.
Dungeon Master 02:05:54 um great weapons i think great weapon fighters you're fighting type and you re-roll ones and twos on two-handed attacks yeah
Kaladen Shash 02:06:29 Why is it out where people? Use the dice. Whoever wants this.
Dungeon Master 02:06:33 I don't know. No. Free action. Yeah. What?
Cyrus Schwert 02:06:35 Does it take an action to drop a polymorph? Like if I was, it's just a three? Okay. Another question. If I use movement as a monkey, does it minus it out of mind if I change? Like, I can't take two movements. Like a movement as a monkey, free action, drop it movement.
Cyrus Schwert 02:07:06 as a person. I don't imagine. Okay. Sorry.
Dungeon Master 02:07:09 Yeah, it's so you get one movement economy. Mm-hmm. One rewrite, you don't get to, yeah, unfortunate. 12 more.
Kaladen Shash 02:07:16 So one of them was still a one, but then the other two were, so 12 more. Yeah. Not as I said, it's just to get landed again.
Dungeon Master 02:07:32 It's looking hurt. You guys, it's got visible wear and tear. Some of the spots that were just flamed before are like extinguished, just looks like coal or charcoal underneath. Feeling it. At the end of your turn, it's going to use a legendary action and take a beak attack on Leopold's use right in front of it.
Cletus Cobbington 02:07:38 Same.
Cyrus Schwert 02:07:46 It's
Leopold Magnus 02:07:58 Going for the kill shot here. Let's see, 21 to hit. I'm gonna shield. Yes.
Dungeon Master 02:08:01 21 to hit Leopold. Shield. A.D. goes up. It is Cyrus's turn.
Cyrus Schwert 02:08:25 Okay. The monkey is going to kick it. Monkey Cyrus is going to get out of that spot. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:08:27 Don't have very many of those left.
Dungeon Master 02:08:37 Oh, you are still on fire. You take a D10. I should have done that for everybody else, too. I think you're actually the first one to go. You take nine points of fire damage. Damn. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:08:50 I'm at one monkey hit point. I get over to Cletus and can you bring my guy back? Oh, un-quality one. And then I'm going to bonus action healing word. Cletus.
Cletus Cobbington 02:09:03 Monkey throw me like a dead cow boulder at this fucking bird. That also works. Nice.
Kaladen Shash 02:09:12 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:09:22 Second level, here it is. Really, for 17. Nice roll. And then I'm going to cast a fourth level phantasmal killer, and I'm going to say, fuck you, you fucking bird. And it shows them, I create an illusion of its deepest fear, visible only that creature, and I make a big bird bath.
Dungeon Master 02:09:28 Ooh. Good head.
Cyrus Schwert 02:09:53 I figure that's going to be his biggest fear. And so he makes a wisdom, wisdom saving throw, DC 14. Okay, so it passes. So it takes half of this in psychic damage. Did it roll?
Cletus Cobbington 02:09:56 It's a love-hate relationship.
Dungeon Master 02:10:10 That is 20. 16 plus 4. I don't see anything yet. It's like heavy hit.
Cyrus Schwert 02:10:27 So it takes half of that. So it takes half of that. So 12. And then I suppose that is my turn. I think that's it.
Kaladen Shash 02:10:33 There it is. 20. I.
Leopold Magnus 02:10:33 Oh, nice.
Dungeon Master 02:10:52 Okay. After your turn, it'll use another legendary action. It'll just try to bite you. You're the only one it can reach right in front of it. 27 to hit. Low roll, 19 points of damage.
Cyrus Schwert 02:11:05 Oh. God.
Leopold Magnus 02:11:06 Who's it biting? Oh. Even with my shield, that still hits. Oh, Jesus. One HP.
Cletus Cobbington 02:11:16 No.
Kaladen Shash 02:11:19 Oh, goodness, there he goes, there he goes.
Dungeon Master 02:11:28 Um, your turn, at the start of your turn, you take one D10 fire damage. Uh, yeah, three points of fire damage, you go down. Go ahead and, uh, three half to one.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:35 Oh, no.
Leopold Magnus 02:11:37 Yeah. Yeah. Wait, I guess what was it? Because I'm resistant. Would it matter if you roll a one? Can't roll, can't round down. Yeah. Can't round down. I'm down. I'm down.
Cyrus Schwert 02:11:53 Let's do that. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:11:55 But that happens at the beginning of your turn. So beginning a turn, you take that damage. At the end of your turn, you can make a death saving throw. If you roll a Nat 20, you pop back up. Yeah, it was your turn that it knocked you out on.
Cletus Cobbington 02:12:07 Come on. Come on.
Leopold Magnus 02:12:09 Okay. Uh. Is it my turn? Oh. Oh. Ah, I see. Okay. How about this? What if, uh, what if for this death save, I flip the all or nothing going? Oh, actually, hold on. Don't I have like some, um, creepy doll?
Zariel Torgan 02:12:09 Give me that 20.
Kaladen Shash 02:12:11 Let's go. Well, you can make your make your death roll.
Dungeon Master 02:12:25 So you give us a death save. You were unconscious, you can't flip away. Didn't you use your haunted doll? Didn't you use your haunted doll?
Zariel Torgan 02:12:38 and you fucking die.
Kaladen Shash 02:12:41 Yeah, you're out on the ground. She's like, ciboo. You can't. You can't.
Leopold Magnus 02:12:41 I have like a I say haunted doll. What does this do? Oh, no, no, I haven't used it yet. It's on a third saving death throw. Okay, so that's not relevant yet, but it might be. I was going to say, as I, uh, as I go down, can the all or nothing coin flip out of my chest cavity and, uh, can I roll out on that first dust save?
Cyrus Schwert 02:12:43 Yeah, flip to Klam while you're dead.
Dungeon Master 02:12:58 Not relevant yet. Go ahead. Go ahead. One through two. It's two deaths fail.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:08 Yeah, but if you miss, then you'll fucking die. Oh, it makes it a one or a 20. Oh. Yeah, being that close.
Leopold Magnus 02:13:13 No, no, because it's just attack roll. Yeah, exactly. It's either a one or a 20. I guess what happens if you get a natural one on a death save? Do you have? Okay, so if...
Cletus Cobbington 02:13:24 Isn't it two? We're all making the same face. Correct.
Kaladen Shash 02:13:25 counts as two to fails we're going to get this
Dungeon Master 02:13:28 you lose one opportunity. Don't influence him. You can do it if you'd like. If you fail, you... Yes. And if you succeed, it's you pop up.
Cyrus Schwert 02:13:42 You have to roll real dies. This just feels crazy on a computer.
Leopold Magnus 02:13:42 So if I do that and I fail, it's two death saves, not one. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, fuck it. All right, I'm rolling it. All in nothing coin jingles out of my chest cavity and goes flipping in midair. And if it's above 10, yep, exactly. Let's see how it goes. Oh, baby.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:57 Nice. Nice
Cletus Cobbington 02:14:02 Come on. Come on. Nice. You lucky, lucky boy.
Dungeon Master 02:14:02 Okay, D20, 1 through 10 is bad, 11 to 20 is. At 18 becomes a natural 20 Leopold, you pop up with 1 HP. It is no longer your turn.
Leopold Magnus 02:14:13 It lands. Heads up. I'm back up. Boys dust my armor off. That was something. Okay. All right.
Cyrus Schwert 02:14:14 That's awesome. It's awesome. It's not going to do anything.
Kaladen Shash 02:14:16 cool, just wrote, robotic, sits up.
Dungeon Master 02:14:32 But reminder, you are on fire. So if you do not use your action to put yourself out, you will go down again. Up next is Cletus. Yeah. Just all kind of morphing together.
Leopold Magnus 02:14:42 That's great. So I have one HP, right? Yeah. Yeah, my arm is thoroughly slag at the moment. Yeah, I hate that.
Cletus Cobbington 02:14:46 Yeah. He's dripping. He's melting. He couldn't flip it. That's why he had to die for it to fall out so he could roll it. Oh, shit. Oops. I didn't mean to grab him. I'm gonna...
Dungeon Master 02:15:04 Uh, Trace, what you doing, man? Um, Thomas.
Cletus Cobbington 02:15:18 Fourth level heal in word and just shout almonds and heal Leopold. So many ones again. Oops, I didn't mean to go. You hear me yell from way over yonder and you heal for 22. It's like angelic.
Kaladen Shash 02:15:29 Power work. Sorry, click the button and roll it. Good roll.
Leopold Magnus 02:15:30 What does that look like? Do I just suddenly get better? My ears start ringing in the harmony of almonds rejuvenates me. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's helpful. Give me some time to. They were now, yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:15:50 um let's see yeah i don't know exactly what i want to do you know what we're gonna third level moon beam this fucker right on right on his noggin again the trademark
Zariel Torgan 02:15:55 Are they roasted almonds?
Dungeon Master 02:16:00 on say. Time save.
Kaladen Shash 02:16:11 Moonbe.
Dungeon Master 02:16:36 Oh, that was not the right thing. That is a 16. Fine damage.
Cletus Cobbington 02:16:44 No. OK. Half damage. OK. 9 damage. Didn't like the 1. 10. And I'm going to move. Fuck. That's hard.
Kaladen Shash 02:17:11 which means he'll do it because he'll do it because he says so
Cletus Cobbington 02:17:15 It's hard to not make a line with anybody. Okay. Well, I'm going to hug over here just because. All right. That'll do it.
Dungeon Master 02:17:21 It's got to get its breath back again. The likelihood that I do it three times in a row is low. It's optimal. Okay. After your turn, it'll use...
Leopold Magnus 02:17:29 No matter the probability, it still hurts.
Zariel Torgan 02:17:29 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:17:49 A legendary action. Oh, it's not its turn. It's a legendary action. So it'll attack the only thing in range, which is still just Leopold. That it's a dirty 30 to hit no matter the damage you go down. Oh, you've got 23 hit points. You might live.
Cletus Cobbington 02:17:49 Conce. Oh. Oh.
Kaladen Shash 02:17:52 Moonbeam its turn. Oh, just wasn't very. He goes down. He got it. He got it.
Cletus Cobbington 02:18:18 You don't know that. Immunity to fire and beak.
Dungeon Master 02:18:20 You take 33 points of damage. Uh, Leopold, you go down. Uh, Leopold, you go down again, unfortunately.
Kaladen Shash 02:18:24 Bonus action. Absorb element.
Dungeon Master 02:18:52 And you are muted, sir. No, you're good.
Leopold Magnus 02:18:57 No, I thought I wasn't. Sorry. Yep. I flail around after, yeah, barely, like, coming back alive. I'm still staggering. This thing's pecking the shit out of me. My armor falls stiff as a board onto the back. Gauntlets go flying. Headpiece goes flying. I'm falling apart at the seams.
Cletus Cobbington 02:19:03 You got another coin to flip.
Dungeon Master 02:19:22 Um, it is Sariel's turn. So you take three points of fire damage to start of your turn.
Zariel Torgan 02:19:29 Alright. Okay. So I want to drop my form back to Zoriel and I want to cast Bain on this guy. It's going to be a charisma save of 16.
Kaladen Shash 02:19:52 Excellent. He won't have much curiosity. That birds more charismatic?
Dungeon Master 02:19:58 charisma saves. That is a 16 plus 3. That is 19. Sorry, guys. His charisma is a minus 1, but he's got a saving throw in it for some reasons, so it goes to a plus 3.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:06 Jeez. Yeah. More charismatic than all of them. What the hell? It's like Borat.
Zariel Torgan 02:20:08 Ouch. That's rough. All right. Well, that's all I got. I guess I could bonus in action.
Kaladen Shash 02:20:19 Some sort of celestial creature, he's cheating. Yes, unless it's cantorpe.
Zariel Torgan 02:20:32 I guess like a bonus action healing word. Oh wait, no. You can't do a bonus action as a spell if you are. I did a spell, right? So I can't. Okay. All right. Then yeah, that's the breaks. That's it for me. Should I try to move? I'll stay where I'm at.
Dungeon Master 02:20:40 You did a spell spell, yeah. Okay. Up to you. Start the return and it rolls Cuvicus and breath weapon back on a stick.
Kaladen Shash 02:20:56 perhaps yes very very very smart step away from me am i trying to what
Leopold Magnus 02:20:58 Get smoked by that breath weapon. Yeah, exactly. I'll go ahead and move just a little bit.
Zariel Torgan 02:21:02 Oh yeah, I'll move. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, I'll move over here.
Dungeon Master 02:21:15 Um, Calder, are you challenging it at all? Are you trying to take the heat? Take the heat. Would you say Calden is like trying to be imposing that you haven't been up in its face this whole fight?
Kaladen Shash 02:21:27 I mean, it's not my turn. I'm right where I'm at. I'm ready to attack again. It's my turn. Oh, yeah, I haven't had to be. Yeah. I'll lock eyes with it. I'm the only one that's like out in the open. Excellent.
Zariel Torgan 02:21:44 It is
Dungeon Master 02:21:51 Okay, it's going to use its breath weapon on you then. And it will, just so I can be a dick, it'll actually back up a little bit to include Leopold. Leopold, you'll fail a death save, but just one of them. Calvin, give me a dexterity saving for him.
Leopold Magnus 02:22:06 Solid.
Cletus Cobbington 02:22:09 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:22:12 Um, I will give you a deck save. My armor has some sort of advantage in breath weapons. Is it only dragons or is it breath weapons? I don't know. I need to look at it right. That's inventory.
Dungeon Master 02:22:24 What does it say? Breath weapons of dragons.
Kaladen Shash 02:22:46 Dragons does say that. Okay. All right. Wasn't sure for those. All right, deck save. That's correct. That's correct. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:23:04 19 fails. You're still resistant, though, correct? Five. Okay. You'll take half of 75. 37 points of damage.
Leopold Magnus 02:23:07 Wow. Yeah. That breath weapon is fucking people up. I think I just got soldered to the ground.
Kaladen Shash 02:23:19 casual 70 to 37.
Cyrus Schwert 02:23:25 Casuals, funny. Casual.
Dungeon Master 02:23:29 Again, this beam sort of explodes. Leopold's leg goes flying. His body is tough. There is a huge cut to the ground where Caledon is standing. The stone is only attached at his feet, but it's carved out underneath where his feet are standing. But that is his entire turn. Up at the top, Calden, it is your turn. This thing is looking incredibly hoped.
Zariel Torgan 02:23:39 Oh.
Kaladen Shash 02:23:53 Excellent. Uh, first step I'm going through subject. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, bro. Okay. Okay. It's got a good con. Oh. Oh. Oh. Going down.
Cletus Cobbington 02:23:56 wait did it use was sorry was that it's the bird's turn okay but he started his turn in it sorry delayed reaction come on
Dungeon Master 02:24:01 That was its turn, but it moved. He did third his turn there. That's a con save. No, that's okay. That is a 13. It'll use a legendary action through her succeed instead.
Zariel Torgan 02:24:11 Oh. Oh.
Leopold Magnus 02:24:21 Nice.
Cletus Cobbington 02:24:28 Okay, so half 19. Was that 9 damage? Come on, he's dead. Oh, no, he's at 1 HP, isn't he? No, 1 HP! No, 1 HP! No!
Kaladen Shash 02:24:29 Maybe at like two, maybe at like two, like two. Excellent.
Dungeon Master 02:24:32 takes 9 damage. I'll show you where it's at. This is where it was. So it is at 1.8.
Kaladen Shash 02:24:59 Is it my turn? I will use arc splitter and catch and missed on the first attempt 15. Actually, this is armor class, right?
Dungeon Master 02:25:02 It is your turn. 15 hits. I mean, you're doing minimum one damage. Describe how Caledin finishes the great fire spirit. General of the cursed.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:02 You take them down.
Leopold Magnus 02:25:04 Then Shem Kaladin.
Kaladen Shash 02:25:29 uh i begin i start running you're like leaning down with like the anime run the sword's like way behind me and before i before i get to it i use arc lash and it just like shoots a beam right at its neck and i just kind of continue to slide past it while that beam hits the neck and then it just collapses
Dungeon Master 02:25:39 Mm-hmm. My clean cut just splits light for a second. You see just a thin white light where its neck attaches and also in the head sort of offsets instantly and slides and falls off.
Leopold Magnus 02:25:53 Nice.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:55 Nice.
Cyrus Schwert 02:25:56 Jesus Christ, is Jason Bourne.
Dungeon Master 02:26:08 The whole thing extinguishes instantly. You see the magma on the surrounding area instantly turns dark. And this goes from being this large fire phoenix to a well-done bird cooked. You see an explosion of feathers. Most of them lose colors, but you see two of them.
Cletus Cobbington 02:26:26 Oh, we're eating good tonight, boys. Let's look.
Kaladen Shash 02:26:29 The feast. Ben is.
Dungeon Master 02:26:38 hit the ground and they sort of continue to burn. It's just this huge feather that just sort of gives off this radiating heat that looks like fire. I've defeated my bird. Those are...
Zariel Torgan 02:26:53 Damn. While we're doing this, I'm going to open up the toolbox and I'm going to start to shoveling in coins.
Kaladen Shash 02:26:55 Those two feathers that continue to burn? Are those like, those look unique? Or can you touch them? They give off heat? Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Can we get these into the, get the toolbacks, guys? We got a lot to pick up. All the gems cold.
Dungeon Master 02:27:07 Those are what we call loot. Those are Phoenix feathers.
Leopold Magnus 02:27:09 Mm-hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 02:27:10 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:27:13 Um.
Zariel Torgan 02:27:24 in chimps. I'm going to yell down in there. Tell they tell the puppies to go to their bed so they don't get hit by the loot falling down the ladder. They go lay down. I forgot about that. Oh, I'm sorry.
Kaladen Shash 02:27:25 all the items we'll identify it later dump it no he's very he's very analytical he's a machine that's okay
Cletus Cobbington 02:27:35 Can I walk up and stabilize Leopold? I want to plug. Oh, my God.
Leopold Magnus 02:27:39 All my parts are just scattered everywhere. You guys just went to immediately looting. Oh, okay, so this is, this is for all the marbles. Oh, okay, so this is, this is for all the marbles, though. Oh, God.
Dungeon Master 02:27:41 um leopold actually because of because of the instant rage looting instead i'm going to say leopold is still on fire so he takes a death fail at the start of his turn and give me a death saving pro as zaryl is troubling president
Zariel Torgan 02:27:54 I didn't realize he was still down. Oh, no.
Cletus Cobbington 02:28:05 There's stuff in a bird in a suitcase.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:06 Now, now, now, now your doll would be helpful, but I guess you used it. Yeah. We, sorry, we've, we've got a, we've got a, we've got to save. Oh, it's a fail. All right, we've got the save in the pocket.
Leopold Magnus 02:28:10 Yeah, well, let's see. No, I haven't used the doll yet. So let's just say a D20. What's the deaf say for? There it is. Raw. Yeah, failed, right? Yeah. Yeah, so...
Dungeon Master 02:28:18 That's a fail. We are going to change settings really quick. I don't have an actual. Let me do something.
Cyrus Schwert 02:28:21 What does the doll do?
Cletus Cobbington 02:28:37 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:48 He goes sputer throne starting his journey.
Dungeon Master 02:29:00 It's a little dark, but okay. I'll go with that. Leopold, you are struggling, fighting for, like, the robot equivalent of death. And in an instant, you catch your breath and you sit up and you were sitting in this vast expanse of snow. What do you do? I'll change you think.
Leopold Magnus 02:29:25 This as far as I can see, just like blizzard conditions. Let's see. It's a flat roll. 15.
Dungeon Master 02:29:30 Just, yeah, go and give me a perception check. 15. You sit up and it looks like snow at first, but your hand brushes them aside and it sort of smears the stone underneath. You are in this vast expanse of hatch.
Cletus Cobbington 02:29:36 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:29:59 It's not snow. There is ash raining from the sky. It is thick enough that it sort of fades off and you can't see anything in the distance, except for this large, blurry shape of some large natural structure way off in the distance. But you don't see anything in your immediate area.
Leopold Magnus 02:30:18 Okay, can't hear anything. Is there a wind direction that the ash might be blowing from, or is that just kind of swirling? Okay, I'll just head towards the structure that I can see.
Dungeon Master 02:30:22 just sort of a light wind howling in the distance, just blowing gently where you are kicking up a lot of the ash. Nothing that would be pertinent information.
Cletus Cobbington 02:30:26 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:30:47 you're walking sort of huddling as this sort of kicks up in your face not great distance um but eventually you're walking and you see rather you hear these freaking and steps of this large structure probably knock my phone down that's cool um
Dungeon Master 02:31:08 And you see coming into visual are these large chicken goose type legs bigger than your body. Like the talons of each of the toes are like mid torso and height and it stretches up into the sky. And then this whole house sort of sits down onto itself and in front of you is a cabin. No, it looks like chicken legs.
Kaladen Shash 02:31:30 just giant legs cabin legs cabin legs
Leopold Magnus 02:31:31 Okay, the roosters are made out of stone. Oh, like that like literally like a real chicken, but just massive. Oh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, all right, I'm tracking you. Yep, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm tracking you. Uh, well, is there, uh, presume an entrance?
Cletus Cobbington 02:31:38 Bailey bird legs.
Dungeon Master 02:31:43 Like, it looks like chicken legs that are enormous, and there's a high fountain. Yeah, there seems to be a door. Uh...
Leopold Magnus 02:32:01 Okay, yeah, I'll go and knock on the front door.
Dungeon Master 02:32:09 you walk up the steps each time you hit your footfalls lands on the wooden it creaks under your weight and there's a dull thud as the sound is absorbed into the environment and as your knuckles rattle on the door one two three you feel this warmth at your belt and you look down in your little haunted doll of you that sits on your waist burns up and you are pulled in an instant away from the door
Cletus Cobbington 02:32:19 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:32:36 all the way through the Ashfield and everything sort of blurs in your face as everything is breezing by and you wake up in the battlefield. Everybody around you. Yeah, it turns to Ash. To everybody else.
Leopold Magnus 02:32:48 Ah. I guess that doll is like in my hands just kind of disintegrates. Oh, dear. Ho. Ho. What? And I'm just pancakeed.
Cletus Cobbington 02:32:58 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:58 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:33:06 15 minutes to everybody else. It was like two seconds. It was the time it took for them to stabilize, you know.
Leopold Magnus 02:33:14 Wow. So yeah, I was out for a bit. So yeah, I kind of sit up and, you know, I don't have frizzled hair because I'm a giant suit of armor. But the backside of me has been melted into slag and it cooled and kind of formed in a flat fashion. So I'm just a giant kind of pancake and my helmet's all smushed up.
Leopold Magnus 02:33:34 And it's kind of like glowing orange and singed and, you know, a little bit of charcoal burn on my breastplate. What's that? Yeah. So I'm just kind of sitting up staring at this doll and I, oh dear, ho! What did I miss?
Cletus Cobbington 02:33:35 You're so wide.
Dungeon Master 02:33:35 What did I mean? A little flight just lands on your shoulder and it just evaporates.
Kaladen Shash 02:33:37 Oh.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:51 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:33:58 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:34:00 and I kind of look at everyone and I just see Zareal shoveling gold into the workshop. Well, I see somebody has priorities over there. Oh, you could just hear it sizzle, just kind of psh. Oh, I love the smell of milk in the morning.
Cletus Cobbington 02:34:10 You look to your left and there's a frothy pint of almond milk in your face. It cooled down all your gear. Don't we all, brother.
Dungeon Master 02:34:19 It's boiling to the proximity. Yeah. Oh, well, whoever's going to have it in your inventory, you have. Oh, well, whoever's going to have it in your inventory, you have.
Leopold Magnus 02:34:30 Thank you, Kaletus. All right. So yeah, what's that? 23.
Zariel Torgan 02:34:33 I'll hit you with a third level healing word. 23. So hang on one more time. Let me just get this written down. So I need to add it in.
Kaladen Shash 02:34:39 There we go. There we go. We don't. We don't feel like there are any magical items in there. Or ritual cast it? Can I see any sort of... Okay, just cold. Just cold, cool.
Dungeon Master 02:34:45 2,500 gold worth of gold, unworked gold and various gems. Not really. You ritual cast, and it makes sense that this just comes from like little animal folk. None of them are smart enough to enchant.
Cletus Cobbington 02:34:53 Thanks.
Cyrus Schwert 02:34:55 25.
Leopold Magnus 02:35:03 What about the feathers?
Zariel Torgan 02:35:07 But what about the other?
Kaladen Shash 02:35:13 Ready through, very thorough. Then I think, I'm going to take one of the feathers and then what do I see inside the ashes. I kind of spread it with the tip of my sword.
Dungeon Master 02:35:15 With your detect magic, though, you do sense that the couple feathers that lasted are magic. And you also see that there is like something underneath the act of where the body was of the bird.
Cletus Cobbington 02:35:33 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:35:43 They're like baby bird in there. And identified. Okay, so I just understood, understand what kind of magic it might be? Or just, just,
Dungeon Master 02:35:44 You see this, no, there is an egg, but it doesn't look like it's an actual egg. It looks like this metallic egg structure, very intricately detailed and like etched, but it's just like made to look like an egg seems made of gold or something. It is magical.
Cletus Cobbington 02:36:10 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 02:36:13 I don't have the school because I didn't make it. I'm going to say evocation. Evocation and abjuration. And the identified tells you that this is called the embered mane. And it is a relic. Okay, there is one phoenix feather. Okay, there's one more. So Leopold and Cal wouldn't get those.
Kaladen Shash 02:36:16 That's okay. That's fine. Okay. Okay. Going to take this relic in one of the feathers. What did you call it? What was it? What was the relic called? Something Maine?
Leopold Magnus 02:36:28 What can I take a feather and? And I, well, I guess I don't have identified, but maybe I'll ask Caledon if you're using an identify on the feather.
Dungeon Master 02:36:43 The relic is called the embered main, M-A-N-E. It is just a phoenix feather.
Kaladen Shash 02:36:57 yeah it's just just just valuable phoenix feather official property yeah
Cletus Cobbington 02:37:04 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:37:05 Okay, there's nothing. It's nothing magic about it. Got it.
Dungeon Master 02:37:09 No, there is. It's got fire properties. It could be used as like enchanting fuel. I wanted to use it for something. It just doesn't do something. Anybody else? We got shoveling golden gems, getting a relic, getting feathers, anything from Cletus and Cyrus?
Zariel Torgan 02:37:10 So you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:37:37 I mean, I look in my bag and discover that this bird was a wonderful spirit because he's blessed me with roasted almonds.
Cyrus Schwert 02:37:37 No, that was crazy. I'm taking a moment to myself. It's a whole new dimension of flavor.
Kaladen Shash 02:37:40 Yes, your adventure, get used to it. This is called Thursday. Calm down. Has your body got burned? Look at this new type. Look at this new technique.
Zariel Torgan 02:37:45 you did. I love that somehow it didn't get
Cletus Cobbington 02:38:04 I hand one to Chip and he goes absolutely fiendish over this delicacy. Wow, maybe we shouldn't have killed him. He turns into a phoenix? No. Wait, put the two Phoenix feathers on Chip.
Dungeon Master 02:38:11 It almost looks like he gets drunk off of it. It's so good that he's like holding onto your neck as he's like in a food coma.
Cyrus Schwert 02:38:11 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:38:25 Thanks.
Cletus Cobbington 02:38:34 What if you can fly? All right, that was stupid. Okay, there's nothing else.
Kaladen Shash 02:38:42 A quick question. Should we take short rest and try to catch the knolls or somehow warn the village? I don't know how it's sending our messages. Okay. Yeah, it's okay. It's okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:38:56 Um, well, I don't have the ability to send a message, but we could hustle back.
Leopold Magnus 02:38:56 uh actually jonathan i guess this would be a pretty big recons i won't i won't say but i have uh sending stones we could have left with the tortle yeah
Dungeon Master 02:39:08 I was like you would have to have said that.
Kaladen Shash 02:39:23 I think perhaps take short the rest and then head back as fast as we can. It's many hours that are marching. We might be able to catch them. The fly trick again. Yes, exactly. Exactly. It'll be okay. Yeah, I need to roll some heat dice.
Cletus Cobbington 02:39:27 Well, we'll only have one. We'll only have one bird.
Zariel Torgan 02:39:29 We could do what we did to get here. Yeah, we could do what we did to get here. Jamper. All right. Yeah. So short rest. Do we get to achieve a short rest?
Leopold Magnus 02:39:44 Take a short rest. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:39:56 because i don't have any fourth level slots unless we do a long rest if we're oh i don't okay yeah sure that works yeah no i just blanked on that yeah i was i had polymorph in my head
Zariel Torgan 02:40:04 Should be your wild shape. I think, right? Unless you're multi-classed. Oh, gotcha. Okay. Yeah, that's fair. Do we get one, though? Does it hurt?
Cyrus Schwert 02:40:23 Where's the fucking shortest button? I feel like if I go back, I don't know.
Dungeon Master 02:40:27 I got the top of the screen. Yeah, you guys get along right. Sorry, I short rest in if you'd like. Anybody doing anything or you're all just like sitting down right where you are. Cools down pretty quickly.
Leopold Magnus 02:40:45 Well, I'm just going to drink almond milk until it stops boiling off and kind of turn to the group and I'll say, well, I'm not quite sure what I saw when I was out, but I think I may have found a way to the hag.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:57 Really?
Kaladen Shash 02:41:05 That's excellent. Oh, excellent. That doesn't sound repeatable. I don't like the way that is. Don't like it.
Leopold Magnus 02:41:08 Indeed, she seems to exist in the interdimensional space between life and death. So all we have to do here is kill somebody and, you know, edge him a little bit and we can go have a chat with the hag. I'm going to work on my suit a little bit, try to mend it up.
Dungeon Master 02:41:16 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 02:41:21 Put my wife into pieces. This is my wife's piece of her.
Dungeon Master 02:41:38 Yeah, just a bunch of mending canterps in a row. Your armor starts to undent, clear up. Just little by little, you work up your body. Half hour to an hour to an hour, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:45 silly sale is at least 30 something
Leopold Magnus 02:41:55 We're taking 15 minutes here. Is that how long short races? 30 minutes. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:42:00 It's like half hour to an hour. Yeah, how many days?
Cyrus Schwert 02:42:09 Cletus, did you take your hit dice, your short race?
Cletus Cobbington 02:42:12 I'm about to roll it. So you just get to pick how much you want to use of it, right? Sure, sure. Let's do you do five?
Dungeon Master 02:42:18 Yeah, you can pick up how much you want to use, but it's always important to remember that when you long rest, you only get half of what is spent back. So if you use all of them, you only have half for the next day. So it's usually just like start with half and see what you need from there.
Kaladen Shash 02:42:35 Just as much as you need, yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:42:45 Thanks.
Cletus Cobbington 02:42:46 And the plus three, does that stacks or does a stay plus three? So I have like 1d8 plus 3 per. Okay, gotcha. Cool. All right.
Dungeon Master 02:42:52 It's three per level. So if you're using five, it's plus 15.
Kaladen Shash 02:43:09 Careful do. Yes.
Cletus Cobbington 02:43:22 Okay. Um, okay. So I guess, uh, me and Azario are turn into birds, eh? Unless there's anything else we need to do here.
Zariel Torgan 02:43:35 I'm ready to herd it up.
Kaladen Shash 02:43:37 Well, taste, let's go get some eaters. Let's go get some Arvani, you guys. What do we see? What do we see? For the morphing.
Dungeon Master 02:43:42 Before you burn the wild shape and polymorph, everybody give me a perception check as you sort of make your way down the path a little bit. Perception checks. 18, 12, Nat 20.
Cyrus Schwert 02:43:43 Oh, did the Phoenix leave ears? I got on that Phoenix leave ears.
Cletus Cobbington 02:43:57 So this is before.
Kaladen Shash 02:44:08 Yes, he did. We see it. I got 21. That's pretty good, everybody.
Zariel Torgan 02:44:09 Nice. All.
Dungeon Master 02:44:10 21, 16, nap 20s, obviously good enough. As everybody starts to try to like get ready to go and transform, uh, Sarah, you're just kind of like catching your breath, looking over the clefess, and you see the line that makes up like the torch line of like their fireworm thing they do. Um, this is dispersing. They're just running in all sorts of different directions. They didn't make it even halfway before they,
Cyrus Schwert 02:44:13 It's all you.
Dungeon Master 02:44:39 You know, when the volcano went dark in an instant, they scattered. Scattered. You might find, you see like small groups of maybe like five or six or so staying clumped, but like they're not heading towards Cottonwood, they're just dispersing into the forest.
Cyrus Schwert 02:44:46 scattered. Hmm. Guys, we killed the big bird and now they're not, they don't know what to do.
Zariel Torgan 02:44:48 And we didn't get any ears.
Kaladen Shash 02:44:52 True. Let's go no hunting. I think so. I think so.
Cletus Cobbington 02:45:08 Should we split up on a couple get on each big bird and go hunting packs? Yeah, I guess we don't really need the cash from, that's also correct. Because he promised his staff as a reward.
Dungeon Master 02:45:15 Kind of like that. Gold worth of gems.
Zariel Torgan 02:45:17 Yeah. Oh, well, I will also add, we just got 2,500 gold. Which is the... It's up to you guys. So...
Kaladen Shash 02:45:24 Let's get some kills and some eat it. We can, we can. Yeah, let's fine. We get stepped in. Can we, I'm okay just getting back to the village quick then.
Cyrus Schwert 02:45:24 I don't know if we need the ears anymore. We're flush.
Cletus Cobbington 02:45:37 But then on top of that was the Noel ear gyms. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. I assume my giant goose again.
Zariel Torgan 02:45:47 Yeah, yeah, maybe we just, we just suit up and fly down. Does that sound like something we want to do? All right, I'll swap. All right.
Kaladen Shash 02:45:52 It's good real. Let's look what we do. We take care of it for you, buddy.
Dungeon Master 02:46:00 Okay, where do the group? The farm runner, Doc.
Cyrus Schwert 02:46:08 Oh. Can I get on the goose?
Cletus Cobbington 02:46:09 Oh, yeah, right. Afflex. All right. All right. That works. That works. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:17 And then I'll carry, well, I'll carry Leo and Caledon. Last time, the goose had to carry Leo and killed it.
Dungeon Master 02:46:32 Yeah. You guys. It's just Cyrus on your neck. So unless you want it to, it was going to be fine.
Leopold Magnus 02:46:38 Yeah. I wrung its neck. It's like. It's like permanently kinked.
Cletus Cobbington 02:46:40 It's true. Oh, yeah, does my duck have an insane kinked neck again, or is it different? I got a solid kink. It's not a terrible kink, but... It was what it was...
Dungeon Master 02:47:02 It's like a, it's like a stattle. It's so, it's like sunken since at one point. Holy shit.
Cyrus Schwert 02:47:03 Don't worry. I am a licensed chiropractor for geese. Holy shit. That's crazy.
Cletus Cobbington 02:47:07 A lot of effort made it straight, but anyway, so even though Cyrus is pretty light, it brings the kink returns, but a little bit. Cleetus is slightly kinky.
Leopold Magnus 02:47:29 Total freak in the skies. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:47:36 Mile high, though, am I right? You guys make your way down. You're flying into the basic hot. Would you see without the drastic, like, localized temperature differences of the heat, constantly given off by the volcano, that the mist is sort of dispersed lightning up already as the weather evens out.
Cyrus Schwert 02:47:39 Romans aren't the only thing he's milking.
Cletus Cobbington 02:47:41 Okay, stop.
Zariel Torgan 02:47:51 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:48:06 It's like getting into the later hours of the day at this point, you guys woke up, spent a little bit of time getting there. You've had this whole trek up, fight, and trek down. So we're getting into like the evening of the next day. As you're going into town, do you guys want to do anything in particular? It is Cornelia.
Cletus Cobbington 02:48:13 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:48:27 Oh, we'll just see, is it Cornelius with his name? Let us go. Third call.
Cyrus Schwert 02:48:29 I just want to go to Cornelings. I flip off one of the little fuckers. One of the little fuckers. One of the little fuckers, one of the kids was staring at the robots before. Fuck you, dude.
Leopold Magnus 02:48:35 It doesn't look like the Knowles made it to town.
Dungeon Master 02:48:40 Who do you flip off? You think this little kid, this little rabbit who has buck teeth or even a rabbit, just like huge in front of his face, he goes, hey, the weirdos are back.
Cletus Cobbington 02:48:49 A little stat. The not normals are back.
Cyrus Schwert 02:49:04 I can't tell you're from Alabama or Britain. Fuck you, dude. Bye, bye, the goose. We're adventures. We're adventures.
Dungeon Master 02:49:05 The runner duck sort of horizontal sort of flies through the air. You're flipping them off as you go back. And he just goes, he cries and runs inside. Get face full of feathers.
Cletus Cobbington 02:49:17 Can I wing flap, Cyrus? Not enough to bump him off, but gets a message. Jesus. He will kill who he needs to kill who he needs to kill.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:22 Poor kid was running out with friendship bracelets just to see you go by. Look at him.
Cyrus Schwert 02:49:33 We're not heroes. We're the bad guys. We're the bad guys, motherfucker.
Leopold Magnus 02:49:37 Really taking it to heart. Well, they say never meet your heroes.
Kaladen Shash 02:49:39 It's very true, very true. It's a looser code, you know.
Cletus Cobbington 02:49:49 Because who knows, they might turn out like Cyrus.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:53 Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:49:53 Eventually, make your way back up to the sort of northern most point of the town, up the rickety path over the pond into Cornelius's little shanty. You make your way in. He's sitting there around the cauldroner, and sort of making himself a large stew.
Dungeon Master 02:50:17 As you guys enter, he just goes, oh, well, it's great to see you so soon. He takes a sip, and you see his eyes widen, and you swear that his wrinkles get a little less prominent. And he's just like,
Cletus Cobbington 02:50:27 Yep, we have slain the firebird as I hand him a glass of roasted almond milk. Hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:50:49 This is a fantastic. Is the music contest? Is the music contest? Oh, that is not what it is for me. That's funny. It's been on this, like, nice...
Cyrus Schwert 02:50:58 Music is so intense. It's still on, it got a war song. Oh, really? It's just me then.
Cletus Cobbington 02:51:00 So ominous. I just like I just like calm. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:51:14 I was going to say it's nice and I was here in nice and soft calm stuff. Yeah. Yeah. No, a couple of these. That's wild.
Leopold Magnus 02:51:14 Yeah. You sound like a title.
Zariel Torgan 02:51:20 It's calm. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:51:29 Okay. Now I'm on that. It was just for me. It's just from N6.5. These are from Knowles.
Dungeon Master 02:51:34 Oh, it did get all weird. I don't know what happened. That might have been when my music went out and everything. Oh, fuck.
Cletus Cobbington 02:51:40 We hand him, we hand him seven ears. Cobald ears. We have captured seven null ears as promised. And proof of death of the phoenix. Show him the wing or the feathers.
Kaladen Shash 02:51:48 Cobalt. Cobalt ears. The feet of the spirit for you. Look at this feather. It burns eternally. Phoenix feather.
Leopold Magnus 02:51:52 We're not even trying to hide it.
Cyrus Schwert 02:52:00 We killed three and a half nulls and we brought them their ears. The cool feather. Cornelius, wake up. I know you're an old turtle.
Cletus Cobbington 02:52:20 That's not how almond milk should work. Oh, no. We portrayed the seven Cobold ears and showed him the Phoenix as proof.
Leopold Magnus 02:52:26 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 02:52:29 But like, we're here. We did the thing, you know. We tried to give them the ears. These are from Knowles. We have seven Noel years.
Zariel Torgan 02:52:29 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:52:32 Hello.
Dungeon Master 02:52:35 I just started to hang in here real quick. What happened? The interesting part about cobalds being lizards is that they have ear holes?
Dungeon Master 02:52:59 So you hold up these, like, armed out pieces of flesh that just have a little holes in them. And you're, like, holding it up towards them. And he goes, I'm not sure if you think I'm a fool. I believe that that is a feather of the spirit, but these look more like lizard folks.
Cletus Cobbington 02:52:59 What the fuck are these? Ear canals.
Cyrus Schwert 02:53:00 Donut holes. They're just donuts. These are from Knowles. I mean, can I make a persuasion, Jack?
Kaladen Shash 02:53:03 We carved. We carved them out. They're like lizard donuts. We told you they're colds. We told you they're cobalt ears. We didn't say they were anything else.
Cyrus Schwert 02:53:28 We fucked him up so bad. This was all that was left.
Zariel Torgan 02:53:32 Yeah, honest mistake.
Cletus Cobbington 02:53:34 To be fair, Cornelius, I don't think I've ever seen a knoll, so I just assumed that these were nulls. Honest was sick. No turtles. That's a promise. Definitely none like you.
Dungeon Master 02:53:45 I hope that you didn't play any family figures. What? I didn't see any of my kind. I honor my deal of ten gold in here. How many did you guys get?
Kaladen Shash 02:53:54 Yep.
Cyrus Schwert 02:53:57 Mm-mm. Cyrus dabs openly. Seven. She's got 25.
Cletus Cobbington 02:54:09 Wow. All right. I think it was. Nice. Do we have a pot, do we have a pot, like a group party pot of gold? Is that how we're?
Zariel Torgan 02:54:17 Yeah, I just put it in the box.
Dungeon Master 02:54:19 Nice. You can add 70 gold to somebody's inventory.
Cyrus Schwert 02:54:27 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:54:40 doing gold I mean we could just add it to the add it to it to it right for sure yeah go for it count it is the count it is the rewards from the phoenix as well
Kaladen Shash 02:54:41 We just threw it in. It's like a pocket dimension. Load it in there. And what do we all? What else?
Zariel Torgan 02:54:49 Yeah, I mean, that's the only reason why I've been grabbing it is not, it's not mine. It's just I'm carrying it. And so anything we want that doesn't have to get carried, we throw it in there. If you want, I can put it in there. Wait, real quick.
Cletus Cobbington 02:55:09 And if my memory serves me right, we were promised a quarterstaff. I shoved the Phoenix feathers in his face again, even more proof. Like a kid.
Kaladen Shash 02:55:16 Great druidic powers.
Dungeon Master 02:55:20 Yeah. Well, I see him. If I'm honest, you seem a little eager to rob a man of his walkie stick. Is he gets up and he kind of shuffles over to his like a little umbrella basket.
Zariel Torgan 02:55:21 Yeah, who could eat?
Dungeon Master 02:55:43 sifting through and he pulls out a gnarled wooden staff that kind of curls at the top of just like old wood it's got some like lichen and algae kind of coming off of it seems to be like a little green glow from the center of the wood knot otherwise fairly just inconspicuous wooden stick and he shuffles over every third step is the walking stick to whoever wants to wield it
Cletus Cobbington 02:55:52 quarter staffs are my weapon of choice
Zariel Torgan 02:56:16 I roll for it? Do you want to do some? Oh, I thought you had the Inky Mushroom one? Because I actually
Cletus Cobbington 02:56:21 But we can roll for it. My argument will be I do not have anything. I would. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I mean, we can roll for.
Kaladen Shash 02:56:21 Excellent. Who else would use a quarterstack? Oh, we've got arthritis. That's right. Sadriel. You've got the spear right now. You've got the spear. You've got the spear. You've got the spear.
Dungeon Master 02:56:26 There are two druids.
Cyrus Schwert 02:56:39 There's two things. There's two things.
Zariel Torgan 02:56:49 Because yeah, I don't actually have a weapon either. So we'll just do straight D20. Whoever gets higher. Oh, there you go go. Good job. Good job.
Cletus Cobbington 02:56:57 Okay. 16. I would like to shalely my old quarterstaff and give that to him in exchange so he has a walk-in-stick.
Kaladen Shash 02:56:58 rollies okay that's a good bar another oh there it is 15 16 surplus
Dungeon Master 02:57:00 The other person will get the other thing. Well, yeah, somebody will get the staff and then the other person will get the spear.
Cletus Cobbington 02:57:25 But a slightly cool one because it's shaleigh lead. That's my trade. Cool. I'll take that.
Zariel Torgan 02:57:27 guide.
Dungeon Master 02:57:32 Done and done. So the spear will transfer her hands again. So Zaria will now have the spear if he wants it. Cleetus, you can keep the staff. I haven't made it yet, but I'll add it to your inventory once I do.
Kaladen Shash 02:57:53 And I can't remember the name of the spear exactly for Jesse to look up. You can search for it when you add guardians make it hit.
Cletus Cobbington 02:57:56 Guardians Death Cap Spear.
Cyrus Schwert 02:57:59 It's
Zariel Torgan 02:58:01 Is it in inventory?
Dungeon Master 02:58:04 You should be able to find it, yeah. Anything else for you guys?
Cletus Cobbington 02:58:31 Um, well, we ran into a... Yeah, we did run into a crow folk who, um, worshipped the spirit, unlike the knolls. And he said that it had, um,
Dungeon Master 02:58:35 Cornius looks eager just because, tell me about your time.
Kaladen Shash 02:58:35 They really don't. Yeah. We're hiked up the hill.
Cyrus Schwert 02:58:52 Yes.
Cletus Cobbington 02:59:02 created a bountiful scenery for this land. Now that it's dead, is that, how is that going to affect anything?
Dungeon Master 02:59:15 takes a deep breath in, long drawn one in, a weirdly pregnant pause before he finally goes, well, I reckon everything will even out and rebound somehow, right? That's always exists a balance. When I moved here, it was bountiful enough for,
Cletus Cobbington 02:59:39 Yeah, that crow was crazy anyway. Did he?
Dungeon Master 02:59:43 I can't imagine that was all him. Did he say anything else to you that might have been useful?
Zariel Torgan 02:59:52 and he, he,
Kaladen Shash 02:59:54 Well, not really, no, he told us to kill the spirit. That's all.
Dungeon Master 03:00:13 captures.
Cletus Cobbington 03:00:18 Well, he said, we could spare it or give it a warrior's death in battle, and we chose the latter. I show my roasted almonds. This is why...
Kaladen Shash 03:00:34 This is why.
Dungeon Master 03:00:40 Well, I suppose every... Every villain maybe doesn't have a story. Like, yeah, lead to believe growing up, pours himself some still. You're welcome to sleep at the boathouse another night, if you'd like.
Zariel Torgan 03:00:42 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 03:00:51 Hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 03:01:02 I'm so tired. I'm exhausted. I want to sleep in the bow-outs. Yeah. Fighting is one thing, and I have practiced. I have sparred hay bales and such, but you're long days, huh?
Kaladen Shash 03:01:07 Yes, you're new at the adventuring. It's understanding. Because we go take a nap. My goodness.
Cletus Cobbington 03:01:26 Well, Cyrus usually only works about an hour of his eight-hour shift, and he's real tired after that. So a full days of adventuring is pretty gnarly. All right. Yeah, I'm good for sleep.
Leopold Magnus 03:01:31 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 03:01:31 Yeah, it's mostly admin works and breaks, not a lot of manual labor.
Dungeon Master 03:01:33 Okay. Okay. We'll stop it. We're stopping it right before you guys bed down for the night so we can do some dream sequence stuff and I,
Kaladen Shash 03:01:49 Yes, we take long rest. We call it. Yes. Okay. What? What? Fire spirit.
Zariel Torgan 03:01:53 No, it's been years.
Dungeon Master 03:02:01 You can review the staff next time before you go to bed if you want to tune to it before that happens. All that fun stuff. And I think you guys leveled up somewhat recently, so I'm not going to level you again. It was a big fight, but I'm going to refrain.
Cletus Cobbington 03:02:07 Okay. Even though me and Leopold died a lot, it weirdly felt easier than the mind flare.
Cyrus Schwert 03:02:15 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 03:02:20 okay it's okay it ripped it ripped it ripped that fire breath three times that was railing it's it's it's a
Zariel Torgan 03:02:23 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 03:02:25 Yeah, that checks out. I got nailed by that thing. Yeah. I did what I did what I could.
Dungeon Master 03:02:33 Really? Three times five or six each other. Yeah, it was 80. Yeah, it was 80s.
Cletus Cobbington 03:02:38 Yeah. I think it's just because the mind flare just took so long, it seemed like such a tough one. But this one was tough just because it was doing so much more damage. Yeah. Well, hey, this one didn't suck me, so that's a win. But it did burn me. It roasted me.
Kaladen Shash 03:02:51 Yeah. And then you just never got like the mind blast again. You got this one's special weapon every, almost every time you wanted it. It did not stop.
Cyrus Schwert 03:03:02 Comedy Central Comedy Central.
Zariel Torgan 03:03:09 It's, if, if, if.
Cletus Cobbington 03:03:10 Do you think the clip of Megan roast will be on Comedy Central? Sorry. The roast of the roast of Cletus.
Dungeon Master 03:03:12 with through my roasted almonds. Everybody's favorite play.
Leopold Magnus 03:03:21 Well, I, for one, I've read some things. Well, I, for one, have read some things, and I don't know much about that.
Kaladen Shash 03:03:23 Probably.
Cyrus Schwert 03:03:31 Did anyone think it was weird that the crow said he prostated himself to this bird? What's this guy doing messing with his prostate about a bird? That's stuck with me all day. Pretty much.
Cletus Cobbington 03:03:42 That's the only bird. That's the only thing you've taken from this. A deeper hatred for animals and that. So that's why you made a kink in my
Dungeon Master 03:03:50 He checked him down to him.
Zariel Torgan 03:03:56 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 03:04:03 Yeah, not a big bird guy. Right. Right. Right.
Cletus Cobbington 03:04:12 duck neck. That's why I was a little pink, because he still respected me at least a little bit, but I was a bird. All right.
Dungeon Master 03:04:16 The king that we just are being there is his fault. No, you guys will... No, you guys will...
Leopold Magnus 03:04:32 So do we have much time to read or do whatever? Or is it just we're headed straight to bed? Got it. Cool. OK. Yeah, I dig that.
Kaladen Shash 03:04:38 Oh, no, he said he'd let us pick it up right before next session.
Dungeon Master 03:04:42 You guys are betting down for the night. So you'll have some time to do some stuff next time. If you want to work on some enchaining or new projects, Rex, I figured out what I wanted to do for your next thing that we talked about. I worked out like the mechanics for it. It'll be a long-term thing if you're okay with that. Perfect.
Cyrus Schwert 03:04:50 Thank you. Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 03:04:59 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 03:05:05 Yeah, that's what I figured that it would be, uh, yeah, like a haul.
Dungeon Master 03:05:14 rewards throughout though. It'll be something you can like, it'll take a long time to make it as good as possible, but you can start using it pretty quickly if you could like. Okay. If anybody else wants to do something, figure it out, let me know.
Cletus Cobbington 03:05:34 Okay. Good for now. Yeah. I like how it was blue. It's sleeping fire is blue. That was sick.
Zariel Torgan 03:05:39 Sweet. Yeah, awesome.
Leopold Magnus 03:05:39 So probably think about it, come back. That was awesome. Yeah, we killed a pretty big bad. Oh yeah, I'll get them. They'll be badass.
Cyrus Schwert 03:05:41 Thanks, man. It's fun, Seth. I'm looking forward to the summaries for these last, too. See how much, how much bananas are learning how phrasing that.
Kaladen Shash 03:05:42 Yeah. Yeah, good session. That's good.
Dungeon Master 03:05:48 Okay. They'll be pretty good.
Leopold Magnus 03:06:08 Well, that's why, yeah, I'm just trying to make them better and better and kind of gotten sucked into it. So good time putting it together. Oh, yeah, I know. I think at this point it's just a fun project, so.
Cyrus Schwert 03:06:16 Cool. Yeah, exactly.
Dungeon Master 03:06:17 I say this every time, but I just really wanted to reiterate it. If you enjoy it, keep trying to improve it, go for it. But also, they're really good as is you could not mess with it. And it would be plot. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 03:06:37 Because yeah, they're already like 98%. I'm just trying to figure out how to get to the last little bit. So. And make it easy.

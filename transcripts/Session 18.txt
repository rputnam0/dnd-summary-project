Dungeon Master 00:00:00 for a 22, Kaladin had a 22, and then these creatures had lower than that. So we pick up, go ahead.
Zariel Torgan 00:00:11 Wait, did we, did we, I think, unless I'm mistaken, we saw it coming and we're like talking about what to do and then in order to continue, we had to like roll another stealth check and somebody rolled really bad or something like that, right? Or it didn't get the drop on us, did it? Okay, so we don't have like a, okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:00:25 Silence. Silence.
Dungeon Master 00:00:31 You had a little bit of time to prepare, but you saw partway through it noticed you. So there is time to do something, but you don't have a large amount of time. I will say you had a net 20, so you can get
Zariel Torgan 00:00:42 Okay, all right, gotcha. Do we have like a round of actions before we jump into this or is it pretty much just like hit the ground running? I just got one thing I want to do. I just want to cast a spell.
Dungeon Master 00:00:57 a full action whereas everybody else might get like a bonus action and a little bit of dialogue if you guys want to do some out of game play.
Zariel Torgan 00:01:11 But if you guys have something that you wanted to do, you know, I'm cool. All right. Yeah, I want to try my first fourth level spell.
Kaladen Shash 00:01:20 Um, no, I have no action. You... You do what you want.
Leopold Magnus 00:01:26 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 00:01:33 I want to cast... So I guess my mechanized being will kind of start to glow red, like bright red. And bits of flame are gonna start to gout and shoot out from the little spaces between my armor. And I'm gonna cast Fire Shield. And it's gonna be... Looking at this creature, does it look like it would be susceptible to heat damage? Just like, it's not clearly an ice creature.
Dungeon Master 00:01:50 Nice. No, they look like they would take damage. Alrighty, what do you guys want to do?
Zariel Torgan 00:02:03 or fire creature. Okay, so yeah, so I'll go with, it's the heat shield, and then that's my action, and I'm ready to rock.
Leopold Magnus 00:02:20 I am So I guess I'm tucked kind of behind Paladin, huh? And I'm in this foliage. Is that right? And they've they've spotted who was it that made eye contact or they just saw all three of us standing here finally Okay, so do they know there's three of us I guess that's why I'm asking Right
Dungeon Master 00:02:30 Yes. I forget one of you. No, they know there is something there. I don't remember if there was one person that was spotted.
Leopold Magnus 00:02:48 OK, yeah, so I think then what I'll do, unless I was the one that was directly spotted, I don't remember if that was the case. OK, I'll talk. Is there actual cover here? Is this actual foliage or is that just kind of open grass? OK, I'll I'll try to talk behind.
Dungeon Master 00:02:59 That's the part that I don't remember, but I just know that you guys have been noticed. Yes, you are. You are in foliage. Yes.
Leopold Magnus 00:03:19 That would be an action to hide, right? Okay. And I won't attempt to hide, but I will take out my steel defender. So, you know, I'll kind of kneel down and emerging from the gears and the, you know, plate configuration on my back comes the steel defender.
Dungeon Master 00:03:36 OK. Let me go get that guy. Kaladin, what do you want to do? Yeah, you can do a mirror image. That's easy enough.
Zariel Torgan 00:03:53 Oh, nice.
Kaladen Shash 00:03:55 Uh, can I take a full action? I, all I would do right now is just prepare. It's casting your image. Cool. That would be my action. What's the plan. And then obviously like mask is on, so we're just talking so we can talk through the flower. Um, what is the plan? What are you going to do? I'm speaking to, uh, Zaria just kind of.
Dungeon Master 00:04:12 OK.
Kaladen Shash 00:04:25 Knowing that he spotted him and initiative first. I love that, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:04:28 Um, yeah, I'll just be like, uh... Well, I think... I think they're coming. I think we need to attack quickly. I'm gonna... take, uh... I can't think of the stupid word. I can only think of out-of-game terms. I'll take the lead. I was gonna say I'll be tank, but that's not really something somebody would say. I'll be in the lead. I'll start making like I'm gonna start walking, but I'm not gonna reveal myself quite yet.
Dungeon Master 00:04:58 Okay. Okay. Well then, um, everything switches over you guys. There's like this tense moment where nothing has happened yet, but you can tell something is going to happen. And then at the top of initiative Zara, you were up. Yeah. It was just like easy. Yes.
Leopold Magnus 00:05:15 Jonathan, could I have a bonus action as well? OK, could I just bring up the stones? Excellent. OK, I'll have done that as well.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:15 Alright. Sweet. Alright, so I have action, bonus, and movement. Let's see, I got the dog and I got the guy. I would like to move up.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:40 And then I'll use my action to... Let's see. I don't really have a good bonus action economy. So I will just... Ooh, nice. I will Wild Shape into my bear form. And I will move out to right here. And I will...
Zariel Torgan 00:06:09 Attack. Let's see, where are we at here? Bam. Okay. I'll make two attacks, a bite and a claw. So that's gonna be... 24 on the bite. And 18 on the claw for the dog. Alright, and then I'd like to roll my way around to here, actually.
Dungeon Master 00:06:27 24 hits. 18 hits. What's your movement? Yeah, that's only 20.
Zariel Torgan 00:06:39 If I can, can I make it that far? I didn't really count. I just moved, I didn't count the feet. It's 40 as a bear. So let me just get my ruler. Okay, alright. So both hit, so that'll be 12 piercing damage on the bite and 9 slashing damage on the claws.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:10 And then let me just make sure that my spell is marked off. Yeah. And make sure I don't have any other stuff that happens with it. Okay, yep, that's it.
Dungeon Master 00:07:25 Okay, good start to that round. Following up with that, it is Kaladin. You see Zariel has sprinting forward after keeping low, just morphed into a bear in one movement, and then unleashed a flurry of successful attacks before sort of moving on to the next target.
Kaladen Shash 00:07:44 I think I will begin to move forward, and while running forward, I will cast the Esopteric Curse as a bonus action, or Esopteric Blast. Then I'm going to attack the wolf dog. Ooh, it's a nat 20. We'll take it. That's the first one. Got a 15 plus 7 for 22 to hit.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:58 Nice. Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:08:08 Natural 20, let's go. 22 hit. 12 does not hit. OK.
Kaladen Shash 00:08:14 Last one's a 10, 12 to hit, not going to hit. OK, so one of these is automatically doubled. So it's just really 60, 10 is what I'm rolling here. Not bad.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:31 It's having a lot to live off of for a few days.
Leopold Magnus 00:08:38 Oh man, that's a lot of damage.
Dungeon Master 00:08:39 32, let's go. With advantage. 28 hits.
Kaladen Shash 00:08:41 32 that's that's fire damage and I'm going to finish running up and I will be flanking. The dog. I will go ahead and take an attack with light splitter. With advantage, correct, yeah? 28 to hit.
Zariel Torgan 00:09:02 Nice
Kaladen Shash 00:09:11 for 13 damage? No.
Dungeon Master 00:09:12 13-1, dammit. Starting strong, you guys. Anything else from Kaladin? All right. Leopold, you're following up a pretty good showing so far. What do you do next?
Leopold Magnus 00:09:30 Yeah, so Leopold emerges from his kind of kneeled position after Bonecrusher had emerged from his armor. Leo goes, Bonecrusher, provide artillery support! I'm taking the flank! And it looks to me like I'm almost 30, maybe 35 feet of this goblin creature on the north end of the fight.
Dungeon Master 00:09:57 Yep. 35 is right. Yeah. Do you have enough movement to get to the other side of the troll? Because where you're at, you wouldn't have advantage.
Leopold Magnus 00:09:58 Uh, if I was in that area, would I be able to have flanking, uh, with Zariel? Okay. So then I will, uh, I'll run just up here, basically the max of my movement and, uh, take a flanking position. Let's see.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:29 Um. No, I probably at the very best, I'd just be able to get on his like north side, I think like like here, but probably probably not all the way around for sure. OK.
Dungeon Master 00:10:46 If you could get to that the northernmost spot, I'll give you instead of advantage a plus five to hit. Go for it.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:54 Nice. Smart.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:56 I'll do that, because I want to try and then I'll just shift next round to get proper flinging. So I'll go ahead and do that. Oh, before Leopold takes off, he'll launch a stone with his bonus action at this wolf here. 18 to hit. Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:11:20 That does hit, but that would also be with advantage. So you can see if you crit. Yeah, but that creature, I'm going to say that creature is harried on all sides. This attack would be defeated. Hits the 18.
Leopold Magnus 00:11:26 Okay, I guess that's a ranged attack, so would that get flanking? Okay, all right. I won't argue with it. 13, a little bit lower.
Kaladen Shash 00:11:27 Thanks.
Leopold Magnus 00:11:42 Cool, so this stone will do 7 damage. So, one of the floating stones, just as Leopold has explained to Bonecrusher what to do, it dials in and, like a flash of light, strikes the wolf. And Leopold will use his full movement to take the kind of northernmost position on this troll.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:46 Ice.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:09 and will take 2 strikes with the Searing Saber, so out from his side, he unleashes this Crackling Blade, taking the shape of a scimitar, lightning blinding the troll, and he will strike. Well, that would be a plus 5, you said, right? So that would be an 18.
Dungeon Master 00:12:12 Which does say it.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:37 Okay, so that's for the first one. Let's see what the second one looks like. That looks like it hit as well. So then I will take two strikes. Okay, seven on the first slashing, eight on the second, and then I get to do six.
Leopold Magnus 00:13:06 Okay. And then I got to read this deal about true strike. I'm not sure how that exactly works. Okay. Oh, I see. Okay. This is not like something to apply when I hit it's like a, it's a spell. Got it. Okay. Yeah, that's fine.
Dungeon Master 00:13:13 True Strike, I don't know why, it throws it on there because you have access to the spell. But it's not like something you get each time. It just includes it because you click cast it. No. I can't figure out why it's adding it to the item.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:34 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:13:39 Yep, so I'll take those two strikes as my action. 7 plus 8, 4, 3, so that's 10, 22.
Dungeon Master 00:13:43 Okay, how much damage was that? Perfect. See the fire slashes across its back, causing pretty good damage. As you hit it twice, you notice that it sprays this
Dungeon Master 00:14:07 like green black ichor and both you and zariel take uh well i think you're both resistant which is great but you're taking 19 poison damage
Leopold Magnus 00:14:23 Oh yeah, resistant. Okay, so that would be halved then. Yeah, Warforged gets a R, it's a poison, it'll stay in your defenses.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:28 Um, I'll leave it up to you, but I'm not seeing that. Oh, does that count as a bear? I'm kind of a different doodad. I'll leave it up to you, but I don't know, I mean, aesthetically, yes, but I don't know. I don't want to take advantage. I'm already a big pile of hit points, but
Kaladen Shash 00:14:46 Are you a metal bear? Are you a metal bear?
Dungeon Master 00:14:48 I mean, up to you. You're a metal bear, right? You're like quarter resistant. How about that? You'll take three quarters damage. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:59 Let's see what we got. Yeah, I guess if I'm a metal bear. Okay. Like 15. Okay, yeah, I'll take 15.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:01 God, I mean, that's rounded down, right? Is it rounded down, right? Okay, 90, yeah. Oh, oh, Jesus, Zario, what is this stuff? And I fling a pile of it to the ground.
Dungeon Master 00:15:18 Yes, so it'd be 9 damage. And then... You yell at a bear. And then go ahead, Rex, roll me a d4.
Kaladen Shash 00:15:21 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:32 Hello.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:40 Oh, boy. Hey, a four. Hopefully that's good.
Dungeon Master 00:15:50 Four, okay. You feel the ground start to shake a little bit, like pebbles make a little bit of noise and they like vibrate a little bit, but then it kind of subsides briefly. After you, it is this dog creature. It is harried between both targets. Yeah, it'll go.
Leopold Magnus 00:16:12 Oh wait, my still defender would have gone, right? Yeah, so he'll take what's up. Yeah, I'm not sure why he's got an X. I don't think he's dead. Yeah. How do you want to do this? That's great.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:17 Is that guy... Is that guy really dead already? Yeah, you can leave it that way. Yeah, we killed him, dude. Who gets the kill?
Dungeon Master 00:16:26 Oh, I was changing his health and I got distracted partway too. No.
Kaladen Shash 00:16:31 I was going to say, sweet, we already got one down. I didn't even see the killing blow. How do you want to do this? What? What?
Leopold Magnus 00:16:43 Yeah, okay, so the steel defender, you know, after Leopold spent due time improving his weapon capabilities, spins up and his arm almost kind of transitions into a cannon shape of a jet engine. You can hear it pulling in air rapidly and you hear this, as it whirls up and out comes a blast of a fire bolt.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:08 Ooh, damn.
Dungeon Master 00:17:09 Oh, nice. It's aiming at the dog creature. It just misses.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:11 I don't think it'll hit 13. The wolf. Yeah. All right. Yeah, so he's not quite stable on his feet. He takes aim and it's just a little off. He singes some ear hairs on the dog. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:17:13 It's tackles down.
Dungeon Master 00:17:39 Alrighty, and then it's this dog creature's turn. Kaladin was the most, well, the still defender was the most recent to hurt it. It'll do one attack on both of you. Just split it at the moment. It'll do bite attack at Kaladin because the dog is facing you, and you see Zariel in your bear form. Its tail, like a stinger, whips out and hits you, will attempt to hit you as
Kaladen Shash 00:17:43 Yep. Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:18:10 you are like herring it from behind. We'll do the bite first. 19 to hit Kaladin. And then 12 to hit the bear.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:13 Yeah. Let me double check.
Kaladen Shash 00:18:28 I'll shield. I'll react. Oh, you know what? You know what? Don't let me react. Let me roll a D20. I've got my mirror image up. What am I doing? It hits a mirror image.
Dungeon Master 00:18:42 Mirror image, OK? OK, bite. For a second, it looks like it takes the head off of one of your mirror images before it vanishes. And it's like teeth clamped together. Reels back. Stinger goes at the bear. Does the 12 hit the bear?
Zariel Torgan 00:18:46 Nice. So I have a question. Now, the AC of the bear alone is 12. Does a ring of protection carry over?
Kaladen Shash 00:18:59 Thank you. It's a really good question, actually. It's on your person. Great.
Dungeon Master 00:19:11 That's a good question. Hold on. There's always an answer for it. Hold on.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:13 Because I was thinking about this the other day, is that I'm not polymorphing, I'm like, changing form. And so I'm still the same, like, creature, you know? I know, like, magical, like, armor wouldn't, but like, I don't know. I'll leave it up to you. I haven't been doing it this whole time, and so if it's... Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:19:35 Let's see what Reddit says. OK, there you go. Oh no. Question answered.
Dungeon Master 00:19:40 Yeah, the last sentence of Wild Shape. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. Yeah. Okay. Finger is not as nasty. 19 damage.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:50 So no. Okay. Yeah. That makes- that makes sense. Okay. Well, that's the way I've been playing it, so that makes sense. So yeah, that 12 hits. Uh...
Dungeon Master 00:20:11 And then, can you be poisoned as a Warforged? Okay, so go ahead and make this Constitution saving throw with advantage, but you'll still suffer the effect if you fail.
Kaladen Shash 00:20:18 Surely not. As a mechanical bear, you're not a mammal.
Zariel Torgan 00:20:20 As a bear, I don't know. I have advantage on resistance to being poisoned. Okay, alright, so... That's gonna be... So I'm just gonna roll it twice. So, dirty 20 and less.
Kaladen Shash 00:20:48 you
Dungeon Master 00:20:50 A dirty 20 passes, nothing happens. Okay, after this, go ahead. Oh, yeah, you got your fire spell. 13 fire damage, gotcha.
Zariel Torgan 00:20:52 Okay. All right, and then he takes... Oh, sorry, this just happens when he hits me. The fire shield does 2d8. That's gonna be 13 fire damage when he hits me.
Dungeon Master 00:21:16 Okay, nicely done. Up next is this very trollish creature. It will spin as the only one that's harried it so far is Leopold and it'll take his attacks and you. He gets one bite and two claw attacks.
Dungeon Master 00:21:45 Let's see if he can hit you. First one is the bite. 17 doesn't hit. Claw. 23. Yeah. Okay. One more.
Leopold Magnus 00:21:55 Misses, yeah. This is a claw attack. I'll just take it. How many more attacks does he have, actually? Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:22:13 11 slashing damage and then you take half, you take 1 poison damage. Second claw attack is an 18 which misses. End of the round nothing happens, back up to the top, bear Zarial.
Kaladen Shash 00:22:24 Silence.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:33 Alright, so I'll continue attacking the dog. And I didn't roll with advantage last time, but this time, since I've got Kaladin there, I have advantage, right? Okay, so... Advantage. So here comes the bite. That's gonna be a 26. And here comes the claw. Natural 20.
Dungeon Master 00:22:48 Yes. 26 hits. Obviously hits.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:06 Sweet. Alright. So that's gonna be 7 on the piercing damage for the bite, and then that's gonna be 28 on the slashing damage for the claws. HULK! Yeah!
Leopold Magnus 00:23:06 Nice. Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:23:19 Very nice. A looking hurt. Again, roughly where it's at. Bam. Okay, after Zariel, it is Kaladin's go.
Kaladen Shash 00:23:49 Great. No.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:59 Jonathan? Was the dog the one that spewed grossness or was it just the guy? Okay, just making sure. I thought you mirror imaged.
Dungeon Master 00:24:00 Yeah. Just the troll. I think it is. All right. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:24:14 Uhm, is it is shield up until the end of my next turn or the start of my next turn? I start. Start, cause that was on the last term that I activated. It's gotta be start, OK? Oh, that's right. No, that's right. I didn't even have to. Sorry, I was just thinking if I had a higher AC right now. That's fine, I'm gonna. Yep.
Dungeon Master 00:24:31 Yes, you didn't shield, you mirror imaged. But it is until the start of your next turn. Alrighty, it will take it because it's not very smart, doesn't know that you're trying to do something.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:34 Yeah, you didn't have to. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:24:46 I'm going to go ahead and step. 10 feet backwards. It's OK if I provoke that opportunity attack. What was the number? OK, great, so that's just a mess.
Dungeon Master 00:25:03 Almost a natural 20, but a nine. It was a nine.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:04 Oh, that's what I should have done.
Kaladen Shash 00:25:15 Excellent, so I step back 10 feet. As a bonus action, I cast the esopteric blast again, so three times. First one will hit 21. Second one will absolutely fail, not one. Second one, 13. I think that's a miss, right? We said that just misses. All right, I don't know why it said magic missiles. I was hitting the wrong thing. Same to hit.
Dungeon Master 00:25:33 13 misses, yeah. Same modifier, yeah. Take your attack.
Kaladen Shash 00:25:42 And then just one right? Yep, so then just one roll for the damage. There's nine on that and then I'm going to move right back in. And go ahead and take an attack. It's an 1828 tests, yeah?
Dungeon Master 00:26:09 28 hits. And damage. Oh, looking so hurt, but not quite enough.
Kaladen Shash 00:26:14 And then I guess it never adds the bonus. That's strange. I'm going to hit the button to roll for me. Oh, it did. Okay. It got eight. Okay. I did that last time too. I must've had a really soft roll. That's for 10 damage on the swing.
Dungeon Master 00:26:39 You see the bite on the back from the bear almost cripples one of its legs. It almost looks like it stops functioning. And then Kaladin, leaping back, blast it three times, comes in close to the distance, take a slash at its throat. It's looking so hurt, but it is not quite down. Leopold, you are up.
Leopold Magnus 00:26:57 Yeah, so taking this imperfect flank, Leopold's legs kind of lock. You hear a hissing of steam, and without even really moving my legs, I just side slide, kind of robot style. My arm extended, flanking properly now with this troll. I will take two strikes with my blade, because I now have two attacks.
Kaladen Shash 00:27:11 Love it.
Dungeon Master 00:27:12 Yes, it would. Let me take 10.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:26 Nice. Nice.
Leopold Magnus 00:27:29 And that would be with advantage. 26 on the first strike. And then on the next one. 19 would connect. So then. 10 hit on the first slice, 14 on the second.
Dungeon Master 00:27:43 19 points of hit. Nice. 24 damage. 26. Nice. 10, 24, 34 points of damage.
Kaladen Shash 00:27:50 Nicely done, man. The winging. Neat.
Leopold Magnus 00:27:57 Oh, six on the d4 for one and a four for nine. Jesus. Slashing 34 damage. Yep. Uh, how's this guy looking? Is he looking pretty hurt? Okay. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:11 Damn.
Dungeon Master 00:28:18 Looking hurt, but not nearly as hurt as the other creature. It was good timing.
Kaladen Shash 00:28:22 Absolutely love the Halo music right now, by the way.
Leopold Magnus 00:28:26 Uh, so, uh, maybe I'd like to presume this troll lost an arm or something through the slashing. Leopold, uh, then kind of spins on a dime and you just see him with his hands way up in the air, kind of running stiffly away from this guy. And I'm like, oh, I'm gonna hum, lost control. I didn't mean to do all that. Oh, Jesus Christ.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:43 Okay. All right.
Dungeon Master 00:28:51 With the two attacks, you take 20 reduced to 10 damage. In Zarya, you take 15-ish damage. And then it'll take a swipe at you as you run away. It does not hit.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:03 All right. And as Leopold is running away in a panic because he's just absolutely decimated this creature and didn't really intend to, not knowing his own strength, one stone will kind of pause above his head in an automatic fashion, laser in on the troll.
Kaladen Shash 00:29:08 it.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:31 I'll use a bonus action to cast Magic Stone. 14 to hit? Oh, shit. All right. And so with that, I'm going to keep running. Let's see, how far did I run here?
Dungeon Master 00:29:42 Uh, Mrs. Uh, that's nothing.
Kaladen Shash 00:29:54 We did.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:59 So I'm at 10 feet, so I'm going to move another 20 feet here. And then as, not seeing anything.
Dungeon Master 00:30:09 As you get that close to the water, give me a perception check. Nope. OK, what else are you doing? OK, go ahead and make an attack.
Zariel Torgan 00:30:22 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:23 I was going to say, with that being Leopold's turn, the Steel Defender would spin up his cannon once again, maybe planting his feet in the ground, trying to get good footing. Attack the wolf. The Firebolt. Ooh, I think that hits. 23. Oh, baby. 10 damage on the Firebolt.
Dungeon Master 00:30:42 23 hit. Leopold, deal the fender. Finish this creature.
Zariel Torgan 00:30:54 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:56 Yeah, so the steel defender, empowered after missing one cannon, plants his feet, grinds it into the ground, and takes very steady aim with his other hand, bracing the cannon. And you hear this thunderous boom go clean through the skull of the wolf and shoot over the top of Leopold's head, frightening half to death. He falls onto his knees.
Kaladen Shash 00:30:59 you
Dungeon Master 00:31:24 fan. Wonderful turn. You guys are making quick work of this two monsters that were kind of coming down the pathway.
Dungeon Master 00:31:38 after that would normally be that creature which is now gone so it'll be the trolls turn you see in a fit of rage and panic seeing this creature go down the troll takes its flaw and it sort of rakes it across its stomach spraying out this um like
Dungeon Master 00:31:58 cone, but technically a cube, of toxic vial and acid and poison damage. Both Zariel and Kaladin give me constitution saving throws. Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:02 We still do an advantage on this, because I'm a, okay. 21.
Kaladen Shash 00:32:24 Oh, did you ask me to roll? I'm sorry, man. Please stop. What? You asked me to?
Dungeon Master 00:32:29 21 passes. And what did Kaladin get? BF. Yeah, constitution save.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:35 That's a good strategy.
Kaladen Shash 00:32:51 Uh, this is just a straight rule for me, right? Constitution saving throw, you said? Roger, roger. 18. What is that? What kind of damage?
Dungeon Master 00:33:02 18 succeeds. So you both take half of 24. You each take 12 points of damage. It is acid damage.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:13 And then am I... No, it's poison. Okay. That puts me exactly at zero as a bear.
Dungeon Master 00:33:29 The bear disappears and you see sizzling smoke rising off of its form. You see a robotic Czariel sort of kneeling as his transformation fades. It is not, it's like the equivalent of a breath weapon.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:44 Does the... Hmm. Does this count as a melee attack? Gotcha. Okay. Gotcha. Okay. Alright, I was just thinking for the shield, but it's an area of effect thing, so that's fine.
Dungeon Master 00:33:58 so if you guys if it's like for constitutions like a concentration check you would you'd make it for that kind of deal doctor yeah not an attack role on an area uh nope not yet at the end of the round you guys feel the
Kaladen Shash 00:34:13 Thanks.
Zariel Torgan 00:34:14 All right, so it's my turn.
Dungeon Master 00:34:27 Like, the floor beneath you is shaking a little bit more. Leopold, at sort of the edge of the water, you see waves sort of rippling out from the center and the sides and colliding. Like, something big is moving. Subterranean, it seems like, is what it feels like. But nothing happens. And then at the top of the round, Zarya will just do her turn. Yeah, you guys all feel it.
Zariel Torgan 00:34:49 Did I notice that, or are we pretty enthralled in what's going on? Okay. Alright. Okay, out of my form, I, uh... Is this creature wearing anything metal?
Kaladen Shash 00:34:58 Soft tremor registered.
Dungeon Master 00:35:19 Metal. No. No. Yep. Oh, no. No advantage.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:22 Yeah, I didn't see anything on its picture. Okay. Don't really have a lot of, like, damage-y spells. I'll do a Thorn Whip. So I'll, uh, reach out with advantage. Right, right? Because he's still there. Oh wait, wait, no. No, he's gone. Okay, okay, that's fine. We'll shoot a Thorn Whip. That's gonna be an 18.
Kaladen Shash 00:35:35 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:35:52 18 hits. Okay, you take four poison damage.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:53 Alright, so that's going to be 2d6 piercing damage. And... let's see... Okay, and then I'm going to run away. If I... is he going to attack me? Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:36:17 Yeah, there has been a new run, so he does get his reaction back. He'll take an attack of opportunity. And that'll just be a claw. That is 19 to Hicks. That's not a writing.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:35 Oh, my AC is 20. I'm trying to see if the spell says if I actually get hit or if they just attack. Let me just see here. Yeah, it says hits you with a melee attack, so it's not just if somebody tries. So, okay. All right. Yeah, so I'll...
Dungeon Master 00:36:47 If it's a shield, I think it's just a bonus. Go for the fire shield.
Kaladen Shash 00:36:59 Yeah. All right.
Zariel Torgan 00:37:04 As a bonus, I don't have any bonuses. All right, I'll move back in and I'll come over here since he didn't hit me.
Dungeon Master 00:37:19 Okay, sort of dive through the bushes a little bit. After you, it is Kaladin's.
Kaladen Shash 00:37:30 Looks like I need. But 18 feet to get there. I will. As a bonus action, I'll go ahead and cast the Soptrek blast three times. Straight at it. First 116 hits doesn't hit. OK.
Zariel Torgan 00:37:39 Bye bye.
Dungeon Master 00:37:50 Right on, right? 16 hits. Natural 20 hits. Natural 20? Don't even do your other attack to get full damage.
Kaladen Shash 00:38:01 Natural 20. It's exciting. Natural 20, get the fuck out of here. So 9, 9D10. 2D10.
Dungeon Master 00:38:20 It's a d10 for each beam. So 1 and then plus 2 plus 2, you get 5.
Kaladen Shash 00:38:27 Yeah, so 2D10. Oh no, 2D10, 5. That's fantastic for cantrip, that's fine. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, OK, not bad. Middle of the road. Soft. Oh, get out of here. I love that just stepping forward.
Zariel Torgan 00:38:35 That's insane. Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:38:49 How do you want to do this? Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:38:54 I think it would have been distracted and not seen me so like blindsided it and I would have just didn't you say it like cut its gut open to do the breath weapon I think I would have I think these blasts would have just been centered right through that oozing open gap and just exploded on the inside I mean it feels like a poison bomb
Zariel Torgan 00:39:05 Oh, shit. OK.
Dungeon Master 00:39:22 Yeah, sorry to take half. It's a super soft roll. Six points of poison damage. As this creature is like blown into pieces and you see one of the beam like cuts through its stomach on the side and flies by your head into the water exploding and
Kaladen Shash 00:39:24 There's a super soft roll. Holy crap, did you guys see that?
Dungeon Master 00:39:50 That is that. Leopold, you're not technically out of initiative yet. It is your turn. Unless, Callum, you want to do Moltner?
Kaladen Shash 00:39:55 That was just a bonus action. Would I be able to know if, or can I do a perception check? You've mentioned the tremor. Do I see anything if I just sort of do like a scan as far as like something other like creature coming towards us? Evidence of.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:08 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:40:18 Yeah, a perception check. 13, no, not really. I'll roll something here just to see. Yeah, nothing that you can see.
Kaladen Shash 00:40:25 13. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I think I'll just move sideways in the bushes. Like 20 something feet here.
Dungeon Master 00:40:53 Okay. Into the third round, nothing happens. Start of the fourth round. Oh, yeah, Leopold, but you got something to do.
Kaladen Shash 00:40:58 I think I'll hold an action or hold a melee attack in case something happens in range.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:03 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:07 What, would I get a chance? Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely. So Leopold, after taking shelter from the booming blast nearby, kind of scrambles to his feet, goes, oh, dear God, oh, Jesus Christ, and kind of fumbles around and hits the potion healing, and you hear this, and I will use it, just a regular potion of healing.
Dungeon Master 00:41:26 Open. Open. Ice.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:36 2d4 plus 2. So 7 heal, 7 health. And let me delete that. And now this fork of the glutton, is that a bonus? Would that be an object interaction? OK.
Dungeon Master 00:41:58 That is an action, yeah. No, you might not have those ones, although it's Glutton's Fork. So if it's there, you do have it. Oh, no, hold on right here.
Kaladen Shash 00:42:01 Sorry, name the object. Did you say fork?
Leopold Magnus 00:42:04 Yeah, what was that fork that I got? Do I have that in my inventory right now? I don't see it, but I remember it was something about being able to like summon a meal.
Dungeon Master 00:42:25 All charges regained daily at dawn. You could use an action to expend one charge to target a non-magical object within five feet that weighs no more than one pound. It is magically transformed into food, which can be consumed as a bonus action to regain 1d6 hit points. So you need both of your action economies for it. Yes.
Leopold Magnus 00:42:43 OK. And drinking a potion, that's a bonus action. I see, because this is you turn it into food, then you need a bonus action to eat that food. OK. Yeah, so I'll drink that potion and kind of scoot back up against this bush, kind of panting.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:47 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:43:00 Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:43:12 Oh, geez. Oh, God. Oh, Jesus. Uh, still defender will approach from the area and a, uh, Craig like voice will emanate from beyond his, uh, face shield says the area is now clear. Please resume normal operations. And he'll just kind of take a patrol pattern here.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:39 Nice. All right. We're looking at 22.
Kaladen Shash 00:43:41 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 00:43:43 OK. Started the fourth round, and nothing has happened just yet. So Ariel, go ahead and give me a perception check, same as everybody else. 22. That deserves something. Let's see what they.
Zariel Torgan 00:44:13 Is this to notice the aboleth in the water? Did you mean to roll for that named character?
Kaladen Shash 00:44:18 Oh, my gosh.
Dungeon Master 00:44:22 Um, no, hold on. My thing's freaking out. I mean, just rolled in. Yes, I did, but it's like not loading for me at all. Do you guys see what they got?
Kaladen Shash 00:44:50 No, my mind stopped. I see the perception checks. That's the end. Get back in there.
Zariel Torgan 00:44:52 It's not loading for me either.
Dungeon Master 00:44:57 Yeah, 100% wasn't working. I'm reloading. Hold on.
Dungeon Master 00:45:29 OK, I reloaded. It didn't say anything like about the role, right? That's crazy. It should have. You guys don't see anything. It was a natural 18 plus a number, but once you miss it, Zario and you're looking around, your perception was 22. Which is good enough. You didn't see the person, unfortunately, but you hear.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:35 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:45:59 this rumbling and with just sort of your keen attunement to the outside in nature and like natural arcana you sense that like whatever is moving seems to be localized underneath the like corpses in front of you.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:23 So I didn't catch a being. That's kind of like metagaming that we saw the roll. But I do hear rumbling coming, like, directly centered underneath the bodies. Okay. I'll just... I'll make note of it. I'll say, like... Looks like something's going on down here. Can I grab the foot and try to, like, slide it sideways?
Dungeon Master 00:46:30 Yeah. Yes. He doesn't want to do it for him. Of the troll.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:56 Yeah, I just try to move it to see if I can get any better idea of the sound or notice anything from it. I'll pull it towards me.
Dungeon Master 00:47:09 um so you're pulling are you pulling the body towards you or just like to the summit okay um i mean it's from underneath the ground you can't really sense um like
Dungeon Master 00:47:28 what it is, it's like looking through solid material and being like, ah, that's what that is. But when you move the body towards you, you feel as if the rumbling sort of shifts to be more localized to under where you are now. It does. Doesn't seem to go where you are.
Zariel Torgan 00:47:44 Mmm. Yeah, that was gonna be my question was when I move it does it move with us? Okay If I step away, does it does it come with me or does it stay where the thing is? All right, I'm gonna move it over here and then oh Sorry Gotcha, sorry, I
Dungeon Master 00:48:01 We are still in initiative, so this has all got to be like. Things you can do in a turn. So you can definitely move it around if you want to use your movement to get away, you can. OK.
Zariel Torgan 00:48:09 haven't been playing it that way. That's probably enough for me. Doing all that moving and checking, that's probably enough. Yeah, I just wanted to step back now that I knew that that was the case and make note to tell everybody like, hey, something's rumbling for this guy.
Kaladen Shash 00:48:33 That's where you were moving the body? That's so gross, man.
Dungeon Master 00:48:35 All right. All righty, Caledon, you have a chance to do something because we are still in initiative. We're holding the order.
Zariel Torgan 00:48:39 Well, somebody's got to do it, and then I'll just step back over here or something.
Kaladen Shash 00:49:00 I rolled pretty soft 11. I just feel it's rumbling and I just watched Zario back up. I'm just going to move back just a little further. So I'll just step backwards.
Dungeon Master 00:49:18 Nice, nice, nice. OK, and then Leopold, you have a chance to do something too. That's a tree.
Leopold Magnus 00:49:24 Um. Yeah, so I I guess I'm. Pretty good, I'll move kind of back over here, regain my strength on my feet and I will take a take the fork out of my chest compartment. And. It's like there's maybe a big rock over here. Grab one of those. I just left it. OK, not to say the map is.
Dungeon Master 00:49:48 Oh, but yeah, those are rocks in the ground.
Leopold Magnus 00:49:53 ice, right? But anyhow, so yeah, pull that rock and as I go to just take a huge bite out of it, it turns into a perfectly cooked, glistening, delicious, fat dripping off of it, rotisserie chicken. And it just goes right down into my chest cavity and you hear a thud. I'm going to roll a D6.
Kaladen Shash 00:50:09 Yes.
Dungeon Master 00:50:17 Leopold's jaw unhinges and a Costco rotisserie chicken forms in his hand. Yeah. Where do you want it? Let's say it's got its movement this round, so how far do you want it to get?
Leopold Magnus 00:50:23 Damn, it wasn't that film. I'll take one. Hit point of heels. The steel defender is still on a patrol pattern, just kind of oscillating back and forth here. Area clear. What's that?
Zariel Torgan 00:50:35 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:50:47 Uh, let's see, I guess it walked up here, so it'll just walk over here and it'll kind of like, you know, pause in the dirt, spend nine degrees and maybe start walking back. So I guess it's movement. Um, for the sake of argument, it went up here and you'll just hear area clear, please disperse now. And that's my turn.
Kaladen Shash 00:51:09 you.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:10 Nothing to see here. Move along.
Dungeon Master 00:51:17 Okay, right after you go, you see, his name changed. There we go. Stepping out from the bushes on the other side of the river, you see,
Dungeon Master 00:51:46 this four to four and a half five feet tall rabbit humanoid type creature who's sort of like frantically like is sort of jittering in place looking and before you hear out of its mouth in who speaks sylvan i think it's for sure kaladin
Kaladen Shash 00:52:11 Yeah, I will.
Dungeon Master 00:52:13 who either Zariel or Leopold speak Sylvan. Where's your character sheet? Like on the front page.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:16 I know I don't speak so. You speak common.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:20 Um... I'm not sure I speak any languages. Where would that be? Oh! Yeah, yeah, Common, Druidic, and Sylvan.
Dungeon Master 00:52:41 Like front page under like proficiencies and training. Sweet, OK, so you understand this as well, so it is Kaladin and Zarya understand this. This like rabbit like creature, technically classified as a herring in. Pops out and you hear out of its mouth. Get the fuck out of the path. As. Bursting out.
Dungeon Master 00:53:08 Beneath the troll is this enormous creature. Insectoid with huge fins that sort of spread off of its body. It's centipede-like legs prying and pulling its body upward. And it's these huge, glossed-over blue eyes that you can tell these antennae that come off into multiple directions that are moving around constantly are like actually how it senses with this grotesque
Zariel Torgan 00:53:14 Oh, damn. Holy shit.
Dungeon Master 00:53:38 Moist sort of nostrils at the front of its face and these chittering jaws that open up as it lats out a huge hiss Roar combo sound as as it bursts up through the ground. It takes one full bite swallowing the dead troll before Going down and spending its turn eating sort of in like burrowing destroying this dog creature Before after it does that you see it sort of lifts up and
Dungeon Master 00:54:07 going for its next target, but to Zariel to start the round off again.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:15 Um, just as a basic sense of, you know, the rationality of my character, is this thing like something that we could handle? Or is this just like, insane?
Dungeon Master 00:54:32 You have, looking at it, you think you probably fought something as hard in the past, like equivalency, but this would be a true test if even at like full health.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:49 Well, I'm gonna transform into a bear. Actually, before I do that, I'm going to... let's see... I'm gonna cast Healing Spirit. I'm gonna center it right here.
Dungeon Master 00:55:08 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:55:21 And then I'm going to transform into a bear, and I'm going to sprint. Let me see how far I can get. I can get all the way to the other side with my 40 feet of movement. I'm going to get to right here. A little less. How about there? There we go. And I'd like to make two attacks.
Zariel Torgan 00:55:51 Let's see, I've got to manage my bear because it was like almost dead. All right, I might make a bite attack. That's going to be a 15. And that's going to be a 25 for the claws. All right, that's going to be nine slashing damage. And that's me.
Dungeon Master 00:56:04 15 misses. 25 hit. 9 slashing damage.
Kaladen Shash 00:56:12 is range.
Zariel Torgan 00:56:20 And then, yeah, there's like an ethereal steampunk standing bear with a top hat that's just kind of shifting in and out of existence just right over here, looking to give. It's the size, it's, oh, gotcha. You mean like game mechanic-wise. Gotcha.
Dungeon Master 00:56:37 And how big is it? What's its area? Well, also for everything, visual and effect.
Zariel Torgan 00:56:49 So it is a five foot cube. And then what it does is it's got a little Gatorade bottle for football players where they squirt them in their mouths, but it's full of milk. And it's gonna, yeah, that's how it's gonna distribute the healing. So if you want some, you gotta go to little bear over here and get yourself good. Yeah, it's very high in protein.
Leopold Magnus 00:57:06 The bear does. We got to get some bear milk. What's the heels for that?
Kaladen Shash 00:57:14 and kill squirt. And then just 1d6 per round for so many runs. Cool.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:21 It's as many d6s as I want to give. Let me double check the actual rules. Yeah. For 1 plus my spellcasting ability modifier, which is 4. So 5 total. So 5 rounds of healing. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:57:40 Okay, and it's here in this little square. You just hurled the Gatorade bottle out here on the ground, just kind of rolling around in the dirt.
Kaladen Shash 00:57:47 Yeah, you can see this little icon right there, a little square on the map.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:56 Yes, and that was as a bonus action, which is why I was able to still attack, just in case you're worried. And then, let's see... Making sure... When you cast a level, a spell thought of 3rd or higher, it increases by 1d6. Okay, so... I'm just gonna do 2nd level. Alright, that's my turn.
Dungeon Master 00:58:23 Okay, good turn. At the end of that, Kaladin is your go. Nice. 21 hits.
Kaladen Shash 00:58:29 I think I would sort of pop up from wherever I've been hiding is this thing popped out and. I'm going to do the same thing and cast. This object blast at it. 21 to hit. 19 to hit. And a 20 to hit 3020.
Dungeon Master 00:58:52 19 hits. 30, 20 hits.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:58 Also, as a point of order, just so you guys know, it's not limited to 1d6 per round. It's, in Telespellens, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the spirit space for the first time, or starts its turn there, you cause it to heal 1d6. And so,
Leopold Magnus 00:58:58 eyes.
Kaladen Shash 00:59:01 Very sweet. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:25 You know, if you guys can both run towards it, it's not like you have to wait if you want to. Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:59:30 Oh cool, it's not by round, it's just everyone can. OK, cool cool. The box gives it every time. That's great. Uhm? I'm going, I think I can get up to it. Sorry, I only moved 30 feet. I'm going to go ahead and just move. 15 feet to the.
Kaladen Shash 01:00:00 The box do I have to start my turn in it? Is that right? OK, perfect. So when I move to there and I'll roll a 1D6. Who for 6 hot? Oh, there it goes. OK, I can't do.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:03 No, no, it's if the first time you enter it, or if you start your turn there. Yeah. And that'll be the first of five. Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:00:23 My.
Kaladen Shash 01:00:28 And then I'll move off the square in case somebody else wants to get on it. Or just a little bit. There's another. Don't move 11 feet that way. Or did I move? That's funny.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:00 Why can I not get to... This is so tricky. How do I get to just my... There's like bearing. There we go. Yeah, that movement's gonna be the end of my turn. I won't be able to get close enough to make an area attack.
Dungeon Master 01:01:20 Okay, after you, Leopold.
Leopold Magnus 01:01:25 Oh, dear. Oh, God, that thing is hideous. Kind of stumble over here, and you kind of see me making these weird slides and thumps and kind of slide again, kind of zigzagging in a really strange way. I saw this. I read this in a book once. I don't know if it's going to work. Thumping, a couple of thumps, slide, slide to the left.
Zariel Torgan 01:01:35 but but
Leopold Magnus 01:01:56 And I'm gonna approach the milk stand and I'm gonna have a drink of daddy's milk. That's a 1D6, right? Daddy's milk.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:56 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:02:09 Oh, don't say that. It just happens.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:11 That's a d6 that's what it's called it's got a t-shirt that says daddy's milk on it It just just happens
Leopold Magnus 01:02:22 That's great. That's just an object interaction or does that just happen as you pass it? Oh, hell yeah. OK, so I still have my attack and I have my bonus action. So that was 15 feet, I think, from there. So Leopold will then kind of maybe more reinvigorated than he was move another 15 feet towards the creature.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:50 And with my action, I'll pick a pick a stone up and throw it into my chest cavity and angle myself 90 degrees and launch catapult.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:05 Ice. Mmm.
Dungeon Master 01:03:05 Nice. You shoot out a somehow already mostly digested corpse of a rotisserie chicken. Dexterous is the Remoras. Natural 20.
Leopold Magnus 01:03:17 This smashes into this creature, it's a dex save of 16. Let's see, hopefully it's not very dexterous. It's not very dexterous, but fuck me.
Kaladen Shash 01:03:30 Look at the size of that phone.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:35 He he he he.
Dungeon Master 01:03:35 You see it matrix dives backwards, its whole body sort of going parallel to the ground as the carcass goes flying by, exploding the ground behind it as it sort of resumes its shape.
Leopold Magnus 01:03:50 Leopold hinges at the hips, snaps up straight. Oh dear god! And a bonus action happens. I will fling a stone, last of the three I have up, I believe. Not helping me out much. Natural one.
Dungeon Master 01:04:16 It's not hit.
Leopold Magnus 01:04:19 So with those two attacks, the Steel Defender kind of perks up. Area not clear, please take shelter. And you hear a vrooming of his arm cannon whirl up again, initiating aerial assault attack, artillery mode. And you just see it shoot straight up in the air, almost like it's a shell comes down towards the top of this creature. Let's see if it is.
Kaladen Shash 01:04:28 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:28 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 01:04:52 I think that might hit. 21? Yeah, so it hits this perfect arc, and it just comes right down on top of this creature's head. 2d10, come on. Oh, 14 damage. Not bad. Better than average. Oh, damn.
Dungeon Master 01:04:54 21 hit. You see the explosion of fire damage over the top of its carapace seems to do nothing. As it deflects and disperses, the fire does not take purchase.
Zariel Torgan 01:05:05 Nice. Oh. Hmm. Interesting.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:27 That's pretty apparent to Leopold.
Dungeon Master 01:05:30 Yeah. The impact seems to register as a tension, but it doesn't reel at the attack whatsoever. It's very obvious. It doesn't do anything to it. Is that all on Leopold's turn?
Zariel Torgan 01:05:38 Did we notice that or is he gonna have to tell us? Okay, okay, okay. Oh shit.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:55 Yep, that's all my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:06:00 Up next is this rabbit-like figure. You see he's sort of like... His name's Wesley, but you just don't know that yet. Wesley is pacing back and forth, unsure of what to do before he reluctantly sort of wades in a little bit, up to about his mid-waist, getting soaked.
Zariel Torgan 01:06:06 I'm pretty sure his name is Rabbit Shit.
Kaladen Shash 01:06:10 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:06:26 As he gets closer you see a little bit more of his figure. He's got a determined look, furrowed hairy brows, his ears stick directly up and sort of twitch to the air. He's wearing a nice cloak and backpack. Very odd to find out in this just general scene. Very human in expression though.
Dungeon Master 01:06:47 sort of waves forward and goes, I can't let you guys fucking die now. I mean, you look real capable and all. I got a proposal for you. And you see sort of in his hands, he's holding like fists, almost like what you'd say is like a boxing boxing pose, sort of up guarded by his mouth. Two of these sort of psionic pink pulsating blades sort of grow and form in his hand as he throws one to one after the other after this creature.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:13 Cool. I'll save you. Whiff, whiff.
Dungeon Master 01:07:21 The first one does not hit. Second one. It's not going to make a good showing. Does not hit. One-two misses. Damage doesn't do shit.
Dungeon Master 01:07:42 Just go wide. After that is the Remoras. The only one directly in its immediate space and with its limited intelligence is Zariel, as I think the usual. You see it sort of dives down, it's bleeding with its mouth. Bite attack first. 15 to hit.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:56 Nah. Oh yeah, that hits.
Dungeon Master 01:08:11 Does it? No, it doesn't. Oh, as a bear it does. Okay. You take... 49 points of damage. And you are grappled. That is one bite attack.
Kaladen Shash 01:08:14 Yeah. That was one bite attack. Don't get close to the phone.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:28 Alright, I'm not a bear anymore. Alright, and then... I lose healing spirit.
Dungeon Master 01:08:41 That was a good roll though. Feeling spirit fades. With a big hit. You were in his mouth.
Zariel Torgan 01:09:00 Goddamn, that was a lot of damage, guys. And I'm just grappled. Am I in its mouth or in its claws? Nice. You know what's really funny is I hadn't adjusted my bear's hit points from before, and then you said it was 49. I was like, eh, I don't need to.
Kaladen Shash 01:09:26 It's gone.
Dungeon Master 01:09:28 Good. After that, it is your turn, Zariel. No. Think of it as, like, in the moment, it bites down, grapples you, and then its whole body sort of flares up, and so I'm not gonna say that you are, like, actually up in the air, whereas you would take damage, but, like, cinematically, you are being sort of flung through the air as it's, like, got you in its grip.
Zariel Torgan 01:09:30 Oh shit. Is he not moving with me? He's not like burrowing again? He's just chomping on me?
Dungeon Master 01:09:54 This large monstrous centipede creature. You have your turn. You are just restrained. Your speed is zero. Attacks against you have advantage. Your attacks have disadvantage against creatures that are not this creature.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:15 Alright, so I will... I will bonus action cast Healing Spirit again. Because I don't have any good spells. Or ways to really hurt this guy. And I'm gonna have it appear right on top of me. So I'll roll a d6. So it'll heal me for 3.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:44 Yeah, let's do that. And then I will move it 30 feet, which I can do. Let me add in the AOE real quick. I'm not sure where it went. Oh, there it is. So I'll just put it, oops, hang on, sorry. So I summoned it here, and I'll move it. I'll move it right here so these guys can run past it when they go to fight.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:15 And that way it will give them some healing. Alright, that's my turn. Can I use my action to attempt to break the grapple? That's just a straight strength check? Hmm, I'm very strong.
Kaladen Shash 01:11:27 No. Strong dude. Strong enough. Just barely.
Dungeon Master 01:11:28 Good question, good question. Yeah, DC17. Yes. Two, oh my God. Don't quite get out. Okay, Kaladin, your go.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:45 That's gonna be a two. I'm wriggling. Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:11:57 It's looking a little dire. 26 hits. 17 exactly hits. 19 hits.
Kaladen Shash 01:12:01 I will do the same thing again. I'm going to cast the Soptrick Blast as I begin to approach it. That's going to be 26 to hit. 17 to hit. 19 to hit.
Kaladen Shash 01:12:33 Ooh, pretty rolls, very pretty rolls. That's correct. I'm going to run forward and on the way there pass through the square. And then go ahead and take a quick quick run by. That's why that's why it's so handy that they're squirting it in like a trainer.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:35 Nice. Nice. Get that squirt of milk in you. Mm-hmm, yep.
Dungeon Master 01:12:36 25 points of damage and that is force damage, correct? Nice Just milk on your face I go ahead take your heel
Kaladen Shash 01:13:08 Uh? Bill's gonna be four, it's great. And then here comes the attack. Oh man, Phil, it's run out of theme at the end of that 12. Let me see.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:14 Nice. Could you get... Could you get far enough to flank with me? Or am I not flankable because I'm in... Gotcha. Okay. Gotcha.
Dungeon Master 01:13:15 12 does not hit. Good turn though. You are in its mouth, so you're not flankable currently.
Kaladen Shash 01:13:39 Yeah, I was going to say, I'm not really hearing the enemy there. It's chewing on you. What are you doing in the mouth? Get out of there. It's the end of my turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:45 I think this guy's gonna try to swallow me on its turn.
Dungeon Master 01:13:50 What would you say that for? Oh, Leopold, you are up, man. Is Rex present?
Kaladen Shash 01:14:23 Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Push to talk. No.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:27 You there, Rex? Oh, he just muted.
Dungeon Master 01:14:40 simultaneously with his turn while he, there he is, okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:14:41 Okay. I was weird on my headphones on my phone, like, for whatever reason, the microphone's not working. But yeah, so after witnessing this, this debacle, where Zariel's almost been eaten alive by the creature, Leopold will move up passing through the milk stand.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:01 Doesn't matter it's a thought that counts So this is a recasting Yeah, so it's been
Leopold Magnus 01:15:04 squirting milk just all over his face. Like, yeah, hardly any of it's actually going in. It's kind of splattered. I'll take a 1D6 of heels. We'll see how it does. Yep. Yep.
Dungeon Master 01:15:14 How many more heals are left in that? Uh-huh, yeah. Okay, it's rounds, it's not uses. So yeah, it's rounds, not uses.
Kaladen Shash 01:15:25 It's rounds, it's just rounds. It's rounds, not charges. You said one cluster modifier, five rounds.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:33 Sorry? Oh, oh. What do you mean? Let me see. You're saying that the spell can only do so many per round, not per amount? Oh, oh, oh. Yeah, it's not per round.
Dungeon Master 01:15:44 it's yeah it's you have a certain amount of rounds of healing it is not a certain hit point hit point no i'm saying which is it is it a number of rounds or a number of history okay
Zariel Torgan 01:16:03 It's the number of uses. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so it says you can... It can heal a number of times equal to 1 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. And so it doesn't say a number of rounds, it says a number of times. And then in the first it says whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the spirit space for the first time or starts a turn there. And this would be the third. So there was 2 on the first one and then it dropped and I recast it and this is 3 out of 5.
Kaladen Shash 01:16:05 Oh, OK. OK.
Dungeon Master 01:16:24 Cool. Okay, okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:36 I didn't get much, one hit point. You're over here drinking it all up. I'm just spraying it all over my face, you know how it goes. Yeah. So I'll run past the milk stand and kind of slide down here. And as I'm sliding, I'm going to fling a knife of ice
Kaladen Shash 01:16:41 That milk got me thin already, man. Good milk. Gotta get a drink of it, buddy.
Dungeon Master 01:17:02 Nice, go ahead. Now where on its body are you doing your ice? This is a big creature, so you could aim for like mid thorax if you'd like. I'd let that fly.
Zariel Torgan 01:17:03 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:17:06 I'll cast Ice Knife. Yeah, so because it'll explode in a five foot radius, so I know that in its mouth is Zariel. Yeah, yeah, definitely aiming kind of center mass, trying to avoid the team. 23 to hit.
Dungeon Master 01:17:34 23 hits. Go ahead and roll damage. And then is that a deck save on the extra damage? I believe so. And that is a 12. Fail. Roll your extra damage. Oh.
Leopold Magnus 01:17:38 Fuck me. It is, yeah. Not putting much out today. The dex save is a 16, so it fails, so it will take 3d6 cold damage. And there you go, 10 damage from the...
Kaladen Shash 01:17:41 Mm, man.
Dungeon Master 01:18:00 You see, this is just unfortunate for you, as the ice explodes against its body, in between the individual scales of its carapace, blows out this intense heat. The cold seems to have no effect also. He has two of these and you've hit them both.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:20 Yeah, I was worried about that.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:20 Jesus Christ. This guy has got some beefy resistances. Uh, okay. Yeah. Uh, so then with my bonus action, I'll pull up the magic stone and I'll yell at the steel defender. This is, uh, this guy's pretty hard to hit. I don't think that cannon did much attack in person.
Kaladen Shash 01:18:20 Praise.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:45 Return to office! And Steel Defender will mechanically approach and take a flanking position. Well, actually I don't know if I would be flanking if that Zerial's in his mouth.
Dungeon Master 01:19:01 No, gotta be on the other side of it itself. So if you're still defender could get directly across from you on the other side of it, it would count, but otherwise not. You are right here.
Leopold Magnus 01:19:10 Let me see what its movement is. Oh, it has a 40 foot movement, and I started roughly here. Well, that doesn't make any sense. Yeah, it's something like 30 feet to get behind it, right?
Dungeon Master 01:19:31 It would take you. But let me put the thing reset. Yeah, like 30 feet to get 35 to get perfectly flanking. Go ahead and roll with advantage. 21 hits.
Leopold Magnus 01:19:41 OK. Yep. So it'll use most of its movement, take a flanking position, and it'll do a force-empowered rend with advantage. 21 to hit. Excellent. It will take at least one more.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:05 And, oh wait, that's not a, wait a second, that's just a plus three, so that would be four damage total. On the slash, I've put out a devastating five damage. I think he's looking pretty hurt. Just don't hit him with fire, ice, doesn't do anything.
Kaladen Shash 01:20:06 Gosh, man.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:09 Zillow Curt.
Dungeon Master 01:20:27 He'll make a confidence shot, just kidding. After your go, little rabbit friend, you see he kind of goes down to his haunches, leans all the way down, he takes a 15-foot leap to get to the middle, and then he'll paddle to the shore the rest of his movement.
Dungeon Master 01:20:48 And then he'll take two more attacks. Because the creature is being harried, he does have advantage, so if he does hit, he'll get his bonuses.
Dungeon Master 01:21:15 Damn, just can't hit for shit. First attack goes long. And exactly hits with that. So, with advantage, hits. And that'll be 1d6 plus the snake attack of 4d6.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:17 Silence. Silence.
Dungeon Master 01:21:50 26 more damage. And then second attack with advantage. Misses. Natural 20, but that'll just be...
Kaladen Shash 01:21:54 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:22:21 14 more points of damage. With that, normally this only works with when it is swallowing, but what I'm going to say is that with all the damage it's taken in this turn, it'll make a con save to see if it lets you go.
Dungeon Master 01:22:50 It does not. 24. It holds you in its mouth. At the start of the Remoras' turn, it will, unfortunately, make a bite attack against a medium or smaller creature. It is grappling. If the attack hits, the creature takes the bite damage and is swallowed. So...
Zariel Torgan 01:23:14 Good luck, this thing's huge. Oh, bummer. I'm 21 AC. Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:23:17 Isn't it just like 30 damage to make a copy up.
Dungeon Master 01:23:21 Yeah, 30 damage to make a copy up. It has advantage on this hit because it does have you grappled. Good. 23 to hit. Hold on, does anybody... Let's see if this guy's got anything.
Dungeon Master 01:23:54 Does not. Okay. Okay, so it does hit. You take big hit. 46 points of piercing damage. And you are swallowed. You see Zariel disappears.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:10 Ow. Alright, so I need to make a con save. So, I lose my second spirit of healing. And it is gone.
Kaladen Shash 01:24:27 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:24:45 End of the round. Start of the turn. Zariel, you are blind and restrained. You are blinded and restrained. You have total cover against any attacks and other effects outside of the Remoras. And you take 4d6 acid damage at the start of your turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:14 Well, let's see how this goes. No sweat. So. OK.
Kaladen Shash 01:25:14 Good God. It's 30 points in a round, right, Jonathan? Not on one attack? Okay. A single individual turn, okay.
Dungeon Master 01:25:19 12 points of asset damage. Yeah. Oh, it is 30 damage or more on a single turn. Yeah, single turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:44 Does the fire damage do anything inside the creature? Or I guess I'm not getting hit with a melee attack, so it wouldn't go off. Okay, I'll take... Do our charges on our armor still work?
Kaladen Shash 01:25:44 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:26:07 Not the ones that come innate, but you guys did get a bunch of healing before you left if you remember
Zariel Torgan 01:26:15 Yeah, I just didn't know if I wanted to burn that yet. I'm trying to think. I got six hit points since the start of my turn. I won't take more damage until the next round. I should just bank on somebody helping me instead of burning that. So I will... Yeah, I'll cast Faerie Fire.
Kaladen Shash 01:26:34 Silence.
Dungeon Master 01:26:41 Okay, um It's a deck save in theory I'm gonna say it has disadvantage because it can't see you casting it But this is just this is less about if you actually hit and more of like can you? Make the motions and stuff while in its stomach, but we'll just say it manifests as the deck deck save
Zariel Torgan 01:26:49 Mm hmm. OK. Mm.
Dungeon Master 01:27:11 It has a plus one. That is a five. You're inside of it. Whatever.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:19 Close, but it's not going to make it. So you guys see as outside of it, it opens its mouth after it swallows me. And this big burp of a bubble explodes out and starts to fill the space. And then as it pops, it coats the creature with a glowing iridescent hue. So you guys have advantage.
Kaladen Shash 01:27:22 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:27:48 Nice. Kaladin, you are up. Give me an insight check at the start of your turn, Kaladin. Big carry monster.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:57 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:27:58 OK. Nope. Uhm? If I step out of its range, what kind of attack will it take? Is it always the bite attack?
Dungeon Master 01:28:27 It is the bite attack, yes. OK. You do have mirror image still up, correct? OK.
Kaladen Shash 01:28:34 Damn it. OK, I'll I'll risk it. I get 30. I'm going to step out of its. Correct.
Dungeon Master 01:28:56 23 to hit. Roll to see if it hits your second mirror image. I believe that would hit you. So would you like to shield? Good use, good use.
Kaladen Shash 01:29:09 It does not. It does. I will shield as a reaction. All right.
Dungeon Master 01:29:20 You see its huge teeth, its mouth is so big that it's not that it doesn't hit your mirror image, it just also encapsulates your body and you have to throw at this force bubble to keep its teeth from clenching around your whole torso as it reels back when it does not get the successful hit.
Kaladen Shash 01:29:38 Having sort of dodged that, I kind of slide backwards on a knee and raise my hand up and cast the stop trick blast again. So 26 to hit for the first one, 23 to hit for the second. So one, I don't have anything to reroll ones yet. We're going to work on that. This one's on damage, right? Oh yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:29:52 23 hits. After one method. So see if you have a crit, but otherwise go ahead and also re-roll that last turn. So 26 and 23 were the first attack, so then 8 and
Zariel Torgan 01:30:01 All of those have advantage.
Kaladen Shash 01:30:08 Right? So 9 plus 7 is 16. OK, and then now just one with advantage.
Dungeon Master 01:30:22 9. Second attack misses. 16 misses. No wall with advantage, yeah. 25 hit. 2 hit, yeah, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:30:42 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:30:47 So it looks like maybe so to hit the first. So the first and last hit. Is that where I'm going? OK, perfect. Alright, so here's. The hit, not for much at all. That's lame. Damages damage. Uh.
Dungeon Master 01:30:53 Earth. Correct, sure. Damage is damaged.
Kaladen Shash 01:31:15 I'll rush in and go ahead and take an attack with. Light splitter. One to the 23.
Dungeon Master 01:31:30 Give it three hits. 17 and eight, you're at 25.
Kaladen Shash 01:31:48 For another 10, I'm going to be so short. No, 17. So what's that put me up to? That's 25. Awesome. I will go ahead and use Action Search and take another swing.
Zariel Torgan 01:31:56 25. Oh, damn.
Dungeon Master 01:32:08 Oh, let's go. Another. Do you have two attacks or just one at this point? It's going to be so dangerous when you get that other one. 29 hit.
Kaladen Shash 01:32:19 Not yet, I only have one right now. Next level is going to unlock that, but it's a. I know it's it's going to be another, yeah. So it's. That's another good role. For 18 more damage. I did it.
Zariel Torgan 01:32:31 Pam.
Dungeon Master 01:32:43 18 more damage. He's got to make that con save. DC 15 constitution saving throw.
Dungeon Master 01:32:57 It is an 11. You see its whole body rushes forward, slamming on the ground, almost trying to attack you, Kaladin. But in that moment, it hits the ground, and its jaws force open, and you see tumbling Ass Over Teakettle out of its mouth. Zariel appears right at your feet. And he looks worse for wear.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:19 Well, I don't feel too good.
Leopold Magnus 01:33:21 Sorry, what were you doing in there? All right. Having been unable to deal much damage, Leopold stands in defiance. So I guess, am I within...
Dungeon Master 01:33:27 Leopold, unless Calvin has anything else, it is your turn. Yes, you are with him.
Kaladen Shash 01:33:32 Yeah, that's all I got. So that was a good run.
Leopold Magnus 01:33:51 I'm like five feet from this monster. If I launch a stone up to its face, would that be far enough away to not take a penalty of a ranged attack? Okay. Oh, interesting. Okay. Yeah. Perfect.
Dungeon Master 01:34:03 No, that's not how that works, unfortunately. Yes, it did attempt to bite Kaladin already.
Kaladen Shash 01:34:06 Good. Good. Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:34:10 I think it already used its reaction this round, didn't it? So you could back up, shoot, and then step forward if you wanted to. You have advantage on this.
Leopold Magnus 01:34:22 Yeah, I'll do just that. I'll kind of back up with my refreshed stones. I will take a magic stone attack. Okay, that might be helpful. 17 to hit. Excellent. So the magic stone flies across Leopold's shoulder, dealing 8 damage.
Dungeon Master 01:34:38 17 hits. Go ahead and give me an insight check just during your turn. A scary monster.
Zariel Torgan 01:34:40 Nice. Nice. Hmm. No.
Kaladen Shash 01:34:41 Okay. Something we're missing.
Leopold Magnus 01:34:54 Okay, I'll do the inside check now. Man, 13. Not high on the whiz. Big scary monster, yep.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:09 Hey, did I get to make an insight check on my turn? Damn it. OK.
Dungeon Master 01:35:13 But not from inside of it now. Go ahead and roll with advantage. Liking hips.
Kaladen Shash 01:35:16 You're blind, it's okay. You tried.
Leopold Magnus 01:35:19 So with the stone making contact, Leopold turns, charges the monster to make two attacks with his sword. With advantage. 19 on the first one. And 26 on the second, so they both connect.
Dungeon Master 01:35:44 So go ahead and roll your damage. Exclude the fire damage because it's immune to fire.
Leopold Magnus 01:35:49 Yep. Yep. 13 on the first swing, 10 on the second, 23 damage. So that's my attack, my bonus action. Then Steel Defender, still taking from my last directive, will strike out with a Force Empowered Rend.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:58 Nice. Advantage.
Leopold Magnus 01:36:18 It's 8 to hit. Ah, fuck me. Natural 1. Doesn't hit. Oh, thank God. 19. I think that had to hit. And that's a d8 plus 3, so another 7 damage on the Force Empowered Rend. Chipping away at this creature's scales.
Kaladen Shash 01:36:26 We shall.
Dungeon Master 01:36:34 I think that it looked incredibly hurt at this moment. You see at the start of his turn,
Dungeon Master 01:36:54 this uh sort of rabbit folk individual re-summoning his blades into his hand this sort of psionic energy you see his guard gets loosed for a second as he looks at it and then he he verbally speaks out to you guys again he goes uh i'm not sure if you guys are it's your what your plan is but it's so that's irish he's not irish um um but it's um it looks like it's gonna fucking run what's i could i think i could kill it right now but
Dungeon Master 01:37:23 Do we want to let it go? Pauses only for a moment waiting for the first response. Throws two blades up at its neck as it's already been sort of gouted.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:30 Um, I guess covered in its stomach acid and almost dead, I'll say, uh, yeah, you can kill it.
Kaladen Shash 01:37:40 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:37:53 Roll. I didn't add the modifier yet. 25 hits.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:06 He has advantage too. Okay, gotcha.
Dungeon Master 01:38:09 was with it was advanced. I don't know why it wasn't going up with minimum damage. He would finish you see this blade takes the next and then explodes a second later in the head. So it's almost fully dislodged off the neck of the creature is that half of its blown out on the whole thing with a horrible spring is like guttural sound from his throat falls over flat dead at your feet.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:37 I'm just gonna lay down. I've been better. I got six hit points.
Dungeon Master 01:38:38 You guys are out of initiative.
Kaladen Shash 01:38:53 Zaria, are you good? You okay? And you, friend, why would we let this thing go?
Dungeon Master 01:39:09 timidly stepping up sort of side foot at a time he goes just well uh it's um um looked a little scared i don't know defense seems all right and fair and all but uh i didn't anticipate it coming back i i mean down to kill it's just um
Dungeon Master 01:39:37 was, I guess, asking for permission before I just did it. Yeah, I guess. You see, he looks at his bag, looks at it, he goes, yeah, my satchel.
Kaladen Shash 01:39:43 It's really good, it's fine. I noticed you have a back... I noticed you have a backpack, where are you wandering from?
Leopold Magnus 01:39:45 Will this foul beast deserve to be put down? Say it crossed our paths once again and took a friend out. You did the right thing, sir.
Dungeon Master 01:40:09 Long story, I don't super know you, but you guys want to sit down somewhere or something? You guys sit and chat for a moment. And this figure who goes, it's nice to meet you. My name's Wesley.
Kaladen Shash 01:40:16 We'll take short rest. My friend is already laying down. Wesley, very nice to meet you. Where are you from, Wesley?
Zariel Torgan 01:40:20 hehehehehehe
Dungeon Master 01:40:43 I'm from a little outpost on the edge of the forest. Not a ton of us left these days, but it's a good enough life. I was heading this way with, huh? No, you're the question. It'd be rude to not stop and listen.
Kaladen Shash 01:40:56 Wesley, have you ever seen? No, go ahead. Go ahead, my friend. You said you lived in an outpost. Not very many people left doing this. How large is your network?
Zariel Torgan 01:41:08 Heh heh heh heh.
Dungeon Master 01:41:17 You see at the mention of the word people sort of takes a head turn to that, like that he's unfamiliar with the term. Yeah, there's a few of us left. There used to be more, but some folks who traveled on their own. I was, he continues, I was traveling on this path with some friends of mine.
Kaladen Shash 01:41:30 Preachers.
Dungeon Master 01:41:48 I woke up one morning and they were gone. I tracked them to this old ruins that I'd never seen before. I'm not super familiar with this place, but I got a weird feeling and I heard some things down there, so I got scared. You see he looks a little sheepish, kind of shy, maybe even embarrassed of his actions of just leaving so quickly.
Dungeon Master 01:42:10 happenchance came to get some water and I saw those creatures and then all that crazy shit happened and he goes you guys better be better at listening and his ears sort of twitch and fold like he's picking up some other stuff he's like I heard that uh I heard this remora is a mile away and he sort of heads at its carapace he goes old buck was just feeding
Zariel Torgan 01:42:34 Where do you hail from originally? Would we be familiar with what he's saying? Or is that just a random place to us?
Dungeon Master 01:42:40 um like i said it's where i was born the outpost of cottonwood you to your knowledge there was no life outside the domes right as far as like
Kaladen Shash 01:42:55 This is anything like an outpost marked on our maps that we have Jonathan on our little hologram that. Do we just have a really rough idea of terrain?
Dungeon Master 01:43:09 Dome propaganda goes. The world is a desolate, hostile wasteland outside of the arcane protection. So not only does not make sense to do what he said, but also this is a bunny that is walking on two legs. This is not some creature you've ever encountered. He's got clothing.
Kaladen Shash 01:43:27 Right. We're only used to people human-ish, blended creatures. That's a great picture. That's awesome. Wesley, friend, I have a question for you. Sorry we have so many.
Leopold Magnus 01:43:31 Is it wearing, like, robes or something? Like, what is the... Interesting.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:39 It's just bear bunny ass. That is a good picture, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:43:54 Have you ever seen very large or heard of very large structures in the middle of the plane? Is that so?
Dungeon Master 01:44:05 I'm not familiar with No Plains, but folks around the woods talk about some sort of desolate, abandoned city. Not many go there. They say it's cursed. I mean, they're
Kaladen Shash 01:44:24 Fascinating. One other question. How good are these friends of yours? Do they need help? Okay, perhaps you will help us for more if we help you, yeah?
Dungeon Master 01:44:33 I don't mind the questions from you guys so much because I got a pretty big question myself. They're my best friends and I need help getting them back. I'm happy to return any favor you do to me. I'll do whatever we decide is equal.
Kaladen Shash 01:44:59 Excellent. What's your question? Wesley, what is your question, my friend? Oh, that's it? That's all you want? You do great. Take us to these ruins. What do you know about them?
Zariel Torgan 01:45:00 Sounds good.
Dungeon Master 01:45:06 Will you help me? Yeah, that's all right. I thought I, I had like this big buildup speech and everything. I just thought like it maybe didn't land exactly what I wanted, but, um, yeah, I was just asking if you were gonna, if you could help me. Cool. Um, nothing. Like I said, um, my folks don't live very long.
Dungeon Master 01:45:36 Never even heard of these place before. Real old structures. I don't know, 10, 15 years. You see like sort of shakes in his fur, sort of wiggles in his little tail. He goes, I don't, you familiar with?
Kaladen Shash 01:45:39 How long do you live? Not very long ago. You're right, my friend. OK. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:44 Jesus.
Dungeon Master 01:45:58 I guess you guys look a little weird now that I look at it. He takes a moment to sort of really eye you up, two automatons and a fey elf. And he's just like, you guys are kind of funny. Where's all your fur? I mean, not exactly like me.
Kaladen Shash 01:46:09 with an archery trunk for an arm. Wesley, we maybe lost it. Does everybody have a photo out here? Does everybody look like you?
Dungeon Master 01:46:27 He goes on to like describe the people he lives with and he like describes, he uses terms that you don't understand at first and then he explains and he's like describing large turtle humanoid creatures, feline folk, bird folk, things like fairy beasts that have evolved some sort of sentience.
Kaladen Shash 01:46:41 OK. OK, perfect. Yes, maybe. OK.
Zariel Torgan 01:46:41 Can we try him in common?
Leopold Magnus 01:46:51 This is all happening in Sylvan, correct? Oh, Jens, mind cutting me in? What's going on here? What is this little man going on about?
Dungeon Master 01:46:55 Yeah, they're speaking a language you do not understand. Is there sort of ruffle and twist and tell me just goes in Sylvan? What?
Zariel Torgan 01:47:08 Just be like, mid-sentence, just say like, you know, hey, do you know this language as well? Well, while Kaladin keeps talking with him, I'll let Leo know what's been said so far.
Kaladen Shash 01:47:25 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 01:47:35 Oh, oh, interesting proposition. Well, I guess I'll leave it to you, since I can't really say much to him. And I'm going to start investigating the downed creature. Can I maybe try climb into its mouth, maybe go down into its guts, see if there's anything interesting inside it, see if it's swallowed anything whole? They always eat interesting things, you know.
Zariel Torgan 01:47:59 I remember when you did this against the purple worm.
Dungeon Master 01:48:00 If you, if you go into a stomach, you will take 66 acid damage. No. Yeah. Okay. What are you looking for?
Kaladen Shash 01:48:03 Yeah, acid damage. Don't get in there. Can't be swinging at that. It's going to eat your metals up.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:10 Acid damage, okay, so I wouldn't be resistant to that because it's acid, not poison. I'll go as far in as my waist. Maybe I'll get some on my horns here.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:29 I'm looking for any obvious remnants of creatures that may have eaten. I'm just gonna reach in as far as I can and grab a hold of whatever it is. Maybe some cloth, some bones, just remains. Okay, so troll is all I can see down in there.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:40 Yeah. Yeah, I mean... You don't have thought that magical items can't break down, and so it'd be funny if a giant creature like this just had like a gut full of undigestible magical items.
Dungeon Master 01:48:43 You pull out piece of an arm of that troll. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:48:48 Yeah, man, can't get rid of them. Not bad.
Leopold Magnus 01:49:06 Well, you never know what's going to be in there, you know? It might be something interesting. So then, I guess, exiting its mouth, I'm going to, its eye is really, really intriguing to me. So I'm going to take a look at that, do an investigation. Just look over the creature, see if there's anything useful that I could take off of it. All right.
Dungeon Master 01:49:29 Yeah, you can give me a survival check to see what you can harvest. You puncture one of the eyes, and it just drips out in steep scoop onto the ground, making one of the eyes useless. OK. A remora.
Leopold Magnus 01:49:37 natural one. I'll scoot that goop up, I'll put it in a little vial. I'll have some useless eye goop from, what's this guy's name?
Zariel Torgan 01:49:37 Ramirez.
Dungeon Master 01:50:03 okay yeah we were um we're on like an excursion to sort of push the boundaries i'm kind of a trailblazer of my people and you see he
Kaladen Shash 01:50:09 Wesley, how far away is your village or your outpost like where you live normally? Are you and your friends a long way from home adventuring or are you just out for the day?
Dungeon Master 01:50:32 What you guys are talking and he's trying to describe it, but none of the markers he gives hold a lot of purchase and you see he. You pull out your map and you sort of project it and yours is much more technological and you see he is. Bewildered by this stuff coming out of your armor. This crazy things and so like portraying your map, you see that you guys are somewhere.
Dungeon Master 01:51:01 way sort of up here that you can see, right? And he points to you that he is technically from somewhere, like he has like this much more crude drawn map that's not accurate to scale that you would think it is, but you see he is from somewhere over here.
Kaladen Shash 01:51:28 Okay, so he's come a long way. Yes, take us to your friends and then after that perhaps we discuss
Zariel Torgan 01:51:31 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 01:51:32 Yeah, we've been out a week or so and everything was going great. But yeah, like I said, I woke up one morning and they were just gone and I tracked their prints and it just led to this old building, like a mile and a half up the road.
Kaladen Shash 01:51:57 You helping us navigate as far back as your village.
Dungeon Master 01:52:01 Well, I don't know where they are exactly. I just know they're in that area. Yeah, I mean, he looks up in the sky and he's got a much more in-tune sense of time of day. He goes, it's going to hit sunset in the next couple hours or so. You guys want to keep going? Do you make camp?
Kaladen Shash 01:52:24 Is it safe to make them close to the ruins or is here safer? Okay, let's do that. Please leave.
Dungeon Master 01:52:30 We could probably make camp at where I was staying the night before. As you guys travel, the time goes by. Go ahead and roll me a D20 for a weather check.
Zariel Torgan 01:52:40 Yeah, works for me. I'd do it. I'll roll it. Three.
Kaladen Shash 01:52:59 Goodbye.
Dungeon Master 01:53:04 free. It travels going fine for the first hour and a half or so, but you see a heavy cloud bank sort of comes in off the mountain and you hear rain in the distance. It doesn't quite hit you right away, but by the time darkness hits, you're getting some drops and wetness to your face. Eventually you find you're closer sort of to getting very slowly soaked through. It's not like
Dungeon Master 01:53:33 torrential downpour instant it's just like you can feel them and over time like oh my shoulders are wet chest is starting to get wet lower portion of your belly is starting to get wet just like the natural progression of it um never breaks out to an outright full rain but as it gets really really cloudy um kaladin give me a perception check
Kaladen Shash 01:54:07 It's almost 14.
Dungeon Master 01:54:10 14, you hear this noise, it's like a constant howl at first, the trees blow and whip as the wind starts to pick up, but you find that it hits almost pulses, like the wind comes in big gusts, and a 14, you don't see anything, but you do,
Dungeon Master 01:54:31 swear that you see shadows up in the clouds way above, a large form sort of moon on top of the clouds casting a shadow below, but nothing gets close enough that you get an eye on anything. But like first day out of the dome, I think this forms the impression of like, there is constantly something around.
Kaladen Shash 01:54:56 Yeah. Wesley, how much further is it to the camp, my friend?
Dungeon Master 01:55:04 As darkness completely falls, you guys make camp. He shows you where he was staying before, and it's like this very tall grass. There's some trees in the air, but it's pretty good eye line all the way around. And you guys sort of set up camp and are relaxing and hanging out. You see he plays on like a little pan flute that he carved by hand for a little bit as the food is cooking, but it's very casual night, just a chance to get some rest.
Kaladen Shash 01:55:40 you
Dungeon Master 01:55:42 Guys, like to do anything before you bed in for the night? And what are you working on currently? Okay, give me more animal handling checks.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:49 I wouldn't mind training the pups a little more. Maybe like an hour or so as we're setting up, you know, enough to do crazy. I just want to practice hide a little better. Okay. 23.
Dungeon Master 01:56:16 You did a pretty good check before too, correct? They are getting better at the hide in that when you tell them to hide, they don't just lose patience and give up on it once they get the initial maneuver down.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:22 It was pretty decent, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:56:42 But you find they're not good at staying out of sight yet. They're getting the basics of getting down, laying flat, not making a lot of noise. They don't just come to you right away, but they don't know how to get out of sight necessarily. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:57 Gotcha. Okay. All right. I'll take that. That's all I wanted to do.
Leopold Magnus 01:57:04 Can I work on the still defender a little bit? How much time in the day do we have? Yeah. Oh, excellent. Okay. So yeah, he never resumed his position with inside my armor, so I'm kind of working on him standing freely.
Dungeon Master 01:57:13 It's only about a couple hours before you'd have to go bed in for the night.
Leopold Magnus 01:57:28 And I'm actually kind of trying to improve or harden his defenses a little bit, see if I can improve on his armor. So I'll just kind of tinker on that, maybe hammer away. I think that, let's see.
Leopold Magnus 01:57:49 I don't necessarily have anything in my inventory that would specifically allow me to, uh, like enhance his armor with something. So I'll just maybe just try and get the label and some, some way I could improve it.
Dungeon Master 01:58:07 You could do a tinkering check of some kind if you'd like. It's difficult because you're trying to improve the armor class of a class ability. But we could work something out if you'd like. Yeah, give me a tinkering check. You should have something for tinkering.
Leopold Magnus 01:58:22 Okay. Could it be in the arc? I don't have like a tinkering stat. Could it be an arcana? That would be in the skills.
Dungeon Master 01:58:43 Yeah, it's like a proficiency. It's like a slight of hand plus proficiency. There is some way to calculate it. I don't know. I've never played an artificer.
Kaladen Shash 01:58:43 She's intrigued.
Leopold Magnus 01:58:52 Oh. I don't see anything in the skills, necessarily, unless it's under slide of hand, like the description. I don't see a specific tinkering.
Dungeon Master 01:59:28 Yeah, you don't have anything for it. Go ahead and just give me... You can do... We'll do... Arcana would be the closest, because that'd be proficiency plus intelligence.
Leopold Magnus 01:59:48 Okay. 22.
Dungeon Master 01:59:55 Pretty good. You can write out blueprints for something to plan for. It's not going to be as straightforward as you'd like it to. You're sort of figuring out how this innate ability works of your armor, which you don't totally understand in itself. But you write out some equations and try to assign some spells to it. You're going to have to mix in some enchanting.
Dungeon Master 02:00:19 some like innate armor class bonus it's magical and you'd have you're gonna have to like work long enough on it to make it permanent on it but there is a route okay anybody else doing anything yeah
Leopold Magnus 02:00:29 Cool, sounds good.
Kaladen Shash 02:00:35 yeah and i work on the ring of protection like you said i was like halfway through it
Dungeon Master 02:00:46 Oh yeah, I said I was going to get an enchanting thing and did not do that. Go ahead and give me, how much did you do before?
Kaladen Shash 02:01:07 It was whenever we were doing my arm healing, so there was a period of time where I started the project after I copied the spells and stuff. That's why I was like halfway through it. Oh. Oh, to do that, I think I had done all first levels and I think I had two seconds, so I want to say it was six spell slots to do that.
Dungeon Master 02:01:18 Yeah, but I think I had you spend spell slots to do it. Do you remember how much you had done?
Kaladen Shash 02:01:36 I can donate or do right now I can do five spell slots but I'll short rest before this point and regain my other second level so I can do three second levels if that makes it more meaningful than four first levels.
Dungeon Master 02:01:49 Mm-hmm. Oh, we can work out something. I found a cool table online that I'm going to modify to make it work. It's based off hours. So I'm going to say, with the first levels and second levels, we'd say you're halfway through. So how many spell slots are you putting in again?
Kaladen Shash 02:02:06 Yeah, OK. Right now I can do three first levels and three second levels. OK, let me pop these spell slots real quick.
Dungeon Master 02:02:26 OK, gotcha, gotcha. Go ahead and give me two separate Arcana checks. Yes. OK, mark down two successes as well.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:38 All right, two separate Arcana checks just straight up. I like that. 25. OK. Dirty 20. Excellent.
Dungeon Master 02:02:54 You don't know what it means yet, but again, I'll post the tables once I modify them. Perfect. OK. Good uses.
Kaladen Shash 02:03:12 I feel like that was another significant step. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:03:18 Yeah, I can tell you for this. So shield is a first level spell, right? On this table, that would take 32 enchanting hours. But I'm saying spending the spell slots cuts it down. So you were at, then, what would that be? 15, 17, 16.
Dungeon Master 02:03:47 And then you just cut that down by another, we'll say, eight or so. You cut it down half again. So you have eight hours and technically two checks you need to make. All righty.
Kaladen Shash 02:04:01 Okay, cool. Getting there. Soonish. Now, Wesley, what can you tell us about your friends? Are they all like you?
Dungeon Master 02:04:19 Anything else? No, we all have our sort of specialties, I guess. I discovered from a pretty young age that I could manifest
Kaladen Shash 02:04:31 Can they cast magic weapons and do other things like you, or do they do something else?
Dungeon Master 02:04:49 uh, weapons with something in my head. It's hard to explain. Um, we call it will is how we define it. You guys look like you're, you've got some pretty good will management yourselves, but, um, no, they all do their, their own little thing. Hard to explain, but, um, I'm the only one that can do this, I should say. And you see like sort of throws his hands up in a shrug and then those like psychic blades manifest in his hands.
Kaladen Shash 02:05:21 Okay, very good. And do you know perhaps why your friends went into this area? Is there something particular you were hoping to find? What do you see?
Dungeon Master 02:05:31 Well, I mean, we were just looking for resources. You see, he's got like a little bag. He sort of taps on the bag. He goes, you know, precious stones for trading, food supplies, fruits, things like that. Nuts. Occasionally we get lucky and we find weapons of the old world, things like that. But no, nothing. I don't know why they just disappeared, if that's what you're asking.
Kaladen Shash 02:06:00 No, no, no. Okay. First light, you take us to the place. Great. Yeah, that's the vibe. That's the vibe.
Dungeon Master 02:06:12 Yeah, I'm down. Thanks again for helping me guys. You see, he looks very earnest and not even needing like an insight check. He does appreciate the help. Yeah, the vibe is good.
Dungeon Master 02:06:36 As you guys go to bed for the night, everybody go ahead and give me a charisma-saving throw. You don't know. Just because you want it? No, sorry.
Kaladen Shash 02:06:44 Against what? Is this against being charmed? Okay, 19.
Zariel Torgan 02:06:45 I'm very charismatic. Do I get advantage? Yeah, just because I was hoping I could get it. 14.
Dungeon Master 02:07:05 Good, good ask. 14. No. 18. Nicely done.
Leopold Magnus 02:07:15 18 Yes.
Kaladen Shash 02:07:17 Yeah, boys.
Zariel Torgan 02:07:19 Damn.
Dungeon Master 02:07:21 You all sleep well through the night. Injury is healing. The open air feels nice. You sort of take shifts here and there. Zariel, as you were sleeping, you, in the faintest reaches of your mind, have like a tickle sensation, just in the back of your brain, as you feel something sort of
Dungeon Master 02:07:46 not probe but establish and you find that in your sleep these images project into your brain of this old fort and this old ruin broken down nothing more than stone pillars breaking out of the ground here and there almost like a fist coming out office but like clawed fingers you know rising from the ground you have
Dungeon Master 02:08:07 Large, tall pillars here and there, almost like fingers, but they're just old architecture falling away. You see vines, plants growing up it, large cracks where pieces have broken off, full buildings have fallen, things of that nature. Very overgrown by nature, but you see it very vividly in your brain.
Dungeon Master 02:08:28 And the image sort of scopes out and you see a trail leading to it. It scopes out farther and farther. You get a bigger image before finally it's scoped out so much that you find your camp. And without as much bias as you can, who is the one person who would be on guard? I'm going to let you guys decide.
Leopold Magnus 02:08:55 I mean, I don't really sleep. I'm in sentry mode. And the Steel Defender... Oh, okay. I mean, well, and the Steel Defender can't be surprised. Does that...
Dungeon Master 02:09:00 In sentry mode, you are aware of things, but you still need to get a certain amount of what is considered rest to get the benefits of a long rest. So you could be like, if you wanted, you could be like, I was on watch, but in sentry mode, like that.
Leopold Magnus 02:09:26 help. Okay, I see. I don't know, Cal, I don't know what you think. You're more alert? Yeah, that's fair. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:09:28 This is mostly, what's going to happen is Zariel's going to get up and start walking away, but this is going to be like, who sees him and does something about it? And it's one of you.
Zariel Torgan 02:09:34 Oh, fuck.
Kaladen Shash 02:09:47 I mean, I only need four hours of sleep, so it could have been a four hour period where he was not sleeping. I'm fine with that, I'll go with that. One more one.
Dungeon Master 02:09:55 That could be while you're enchanting, that works out nicely. Kaladin, you were just putting some spell thoughts and power into this protection that you're enchanting and you look up and you see rising from full flat on his back into like an L-sit perfectly upright
Dungeon Master 02:10:16 Zariel sits straight up, his eyes glazed over and unresponsive. He rises to his feet without saying a word and he starts stepping away, just walking in a line. No response. 15 feet away.
Kaladen Shash 02:10:30 Zadiel? Zadiel, hello? Zadiel? Can I... Can I get... Yeah, I'm gonna walk with him and wherever he's going. Can I touch him? Can I shake him for a second? Try to slow him down?
Zariel Torgan 02:10:50 Do I recognize a feeling? Is this something that's ever happened to me before?
Dungeon Master 02:10:51 Yeah, you shake him awake. Sorry, you come to standing. At this point, you guys would have made it like 20 or so feet. You were like at the very edge of where your firelight is hitting. You're just at the very end of that bouncing orange light. You don't remember getting up. No, this is.
Dungeon Master 02:11:18 Weird. Again, the last thing you had seen was just this imagery of this old, ruined structure, just decrepit, abandoned. And you just got this weirdly vivid and detailed path of how to get there. And it was a very warm sensation. It wasn't threatening or anything. You feel as though you were being guided.
Dungeon Master 02:11:42 before you came to standing in this field. It is very pulled out, so it's a very contrasting sensation.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:49 As a player, I know that this is definitely the same city that he was talking about as a character. Do I recognize that? Or could I infer that's what he was talking about? Would I need to make a roll?
Dungeon Master 02:12:03 From what Leslie had described, they were heading towards something, but he hadn't been there himself. He is taking in the direction that, oh, he did, because he went and followed the track. So, yes, he did describe it, and that is what he described.
Zariel Torgan 02:12:19 Okay, so yeah, I'll just relate what I had seen. I guess, do I still feel a draw? Was I able to achieve a full rest or was I interrupted?
Dungeon Master 02:12:35 um yeah you still feel a draw but it's not um like pushing you it's not overwhelming not yet this is the middle of the night
Zariel Torgan 02:12:52 Okay. Alright, um, I guess I'll just, like, well, I'm not sure I've got the vision of the city I believe it's the city we're heading to. Perhaps, uh, tie a rope around my ankle or something and we'll get some more sleep?
Kaladen Shash 02:13:16 Yes. I've already got my four hours of meditation. I'll keep an eye on you. Quite strange.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:23 I would appreciate it. I hate to wander off in this delicate state. All right, I guess I'll just try to bed back down. I imagine the pups were concerned. I don't think I would... I guess I'd put them in the toolbox, but I wouldn't close it. So maybe they wouldn't have noticed.
Dungeon Master 02:13:41 Do you have them out? OK. Yeah. They wouldn't have noticed, but you check in on them. They're still there. One of them lifts its head, notices your presence, lowers it back down.
Zariel Torgan 02:14:06 All right, well then, yeah, I'll just try to get back to sleep. Nice. And?
Dungeon Master 02:14:15 Okay. Kaladin watching over Zariel. He doesn't, you know, zombie mode get up and walk away throughout the rest of the night and you guys all complete your long rest.
Kaladen Shash 02:14:32 And end? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Long rest it is. That's strange. That's strange.
Zariel Torgan 02:14:43 Was it last? It felt like it was a couple before. I'd check into that. Weird.
Dungeon Master 02:14:46 This is awkward. You guys love the last session. OK.
Kaladen Shash 02:15:01 Very well.
Dungeon Master 02:15:10 Yeah, it's coming to you feeling very refreshed. Morning light greets you through the scattered clouds. You can tell sort of on the west of you, there seems to be some sort of storm, but nothing menacing, just natural clouds, very thick, rolling in. You've got hours before it reaches you.
Kaladen Shash 02:15:38 If everybody's up. Yes, do we need to do anything before we try to head to this place or are we ready to try to change anything? Let us go.
Dungeon Master 02:15:39 What would you guys like to do with your day? Okay. You guys make way under
Zariel Torgan 02:15:53 I mean, I'm ready to rock. What was the warning about this city again?
Leopold Magnus 02:15:55 Well, I'm ready to head out if you guys are.
Dungeon Master 02:16:08 Wesley's guidance. We'll see if he doesn't lead you too far straight back. What?
Zariel Torgan 02:16:23 full of weird stuff, like creatures or something. What was the warning about this city? Was it that it was like... He's... Oh, he wasn't talking about leading us to these ruins?
Kaladen Shash 02:16:37 We didn't get much. They were talking about the dome on the 4th, but I don't think they're talking about the ruins here. We're still not taking this.
Dungeon Master 02:16:40 What city? He is, but he took you to where the prince of his friends had left. He didn't see them, didn't see anything else, and he admitted that he had sort of chickened out and ran away and then ran into you.
Zariel Torgan 02:17:09 Gotcha, so he doesn't know anything about what we might be going into. Okay, alright, no worries. I'm just trying to pick my spells, but uh, okay. Alright, carry on.
Dungeon Master 02:17:12 Doesn't know anything now. You guys just travel for a while and eventually, I don't have a map for it specifically, you do find this location that he had mentioned. You come to a clearing and there are large, very old stones
Kaladen Shash 02:17:12 Nope.
Dungeon Master 02:17:38 Like in previous times, you could have called it worked, but it's been so long that it almost looks a part of nature, almost looks like a hand coming up through the ground with the various ones.
Dungeon Master 02:17:49 Some of them leaning together, a lot of it overtaken by vines, grasses, ivies, things like that. And you see Wesley in between two of you, he's very short, sort of points with his little pawed hand and goes,
Dungeon Master 02:18:09 The print lead over there and you see there is and this almost strikes a sharp image in your head sorry all like the exact image you've been fed at the entrance to this place before in your sleep. Points directly at it almost cuts out and blurs vision for a second it also as you guys are looking around you see.
Kaladen Shash 02:18:22 No. Good evening.
Dungeon Master 02:18:31 In this area of where you have that one door where he's telling you to go you notice there are another set of like double stone doors like 100 or so feet away and a different what would have been a building before.
Zariel Torgan 02:18:49 Hmm. And I got a good feeling when I when they had this happen. Wasn't like eerie or anything. It was like positive. Hmm. All right. Your straight wisdom.
Dungeon Master 02:18:59 When you had experienced that it was, yeah, it was a warm sensation. And go ahead and give me a general wisdom check. Great wisdom. I think that's pretty good. You focus really hard, and after you spend enough time sort of checking in with your own mind and your body, you can feel
Zariel Torgan 02:19:18 Uh, 16.
Dungeon Master 02:19:29 If the very reaches of the deep part of your brain that warm sensation like that link that had been feeding you those images didn't totally fade it's it's very faintly just in the back of your head.
Zariel Torgan 02:19:49 Well, I guess I'll relate more specifically to the whole group, what I had seen, and it looks like this is the place to go, indicate towards the entrance. So this isn't...
Leopold Magnus 02:20:10 Well, if you say so, Zario. Maybe we should go take a look.
Zariel Torgan 02:20:17 This isn't the dome. This is like a totally different city. It's like a ruin. Interesting. Massive. Yeah, they're like Rhode Island.
Dungeon Master 02:20:22 Some un-maintained, long-forgotten stone structure. Not like anything you've seen. And definitely not on the scale of the dome. Remember, the domes are, like, large enough that they fit megacities underneath them. This is... Yeah, this is just, like, a couple old buildings that have long since collapsed, and some of them have doorways that still act them.
Zariel Torgan 02:20:48 Okay. I guess we'll head in. What do you guys think? Yeah, when I just now felt that continuation of the link, I wanted to relate everything to everybody, not just you. That way everybody's on the same page.
Kaladen Shash 02:20:58 Yes, let's go ahead. Did you share any of your feelings or dreams about the entrance? OK. Wait. No, lead on, let us see what you feel.
Zariel Torgan 02:21:28 Yeah, I'll just keep following that kind of feeling and see where it takes us.
Dungeon Master 02:21:36 Okay. Guys sort of enter that space. You walk up to the stone doors. You find that they're like partially ajar but very heavy. You push in. You have these dark stairs leading and descending into this building. You sort of adjust with your dark vision, seeing what you can. You hear very faintly dripping water onto stone.
Dungeon Master 02:22:05 And as you push in, this is what you guys see. You see as the stairs head out into the bottom level, you see a divergence in the path. There seems to be a path leading left and a path leading right.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:28 So just to recap, because I might have missed this. He came here with his friends, and they're lost in here somewhere.
Kaladen Shash 02:22:30 Do we hear anything? Do we see any footprints, newly disturbed dirt?
Dungeon Master 02:22:34 The dripping water. No obvious prints, because the stone floor doesn't leave tracks like that. He, with his friends, stayed at the camp that you guys stayed at last night. When he woke up, his friends were missing.
Zariel Torgan 02:23:00 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Gotcha, gotcha. But we don't have any reason to think that they're, like, dead or anything, right? I mean, they came in and... Okay, okay, okay.
Dungeon Master 02:23:03 He tracked them via their print to like the outskirts of this building, but he did not go and get the chicken dinner. He's not been to this area before, and he certainly hasn't been in this building that you know of before. Yeah. That would be more of like a call for you, yeah. Nothing that, no blood splattered everywhere.
Kaladen Shash 02:23:04 Lake Porter.
Zariel Torgan 02:23:31 Okay, all right. We could do a few things. I could... I want to save that for later. Yeah, can I just look at the ground and, you know, continuing coupling the feeling that I'm getting along with looking for any signs of tracks? See if I can, would it be like survival or something?
Dungeon Master 02:23:59 to like sort of discern a path? What's your emotional state as you're sort of, what is there you're experiencing?
Zariel Torgan 02:24:02 Yeah, yeah, yeah, if they came this way using like, you know, my skills to track and then also the feeling that I've been following. Could I make a check to see which way I feel? Well, I mean, if it's positive still, then I guess I'm feeling pretty Zen about it.
Zariel Torgan 02:24:32 you know, not too, not too concerned. I'm not really sure if I've ever felt anything like this before. So cautiously, you know, curious, optimistic, slightly.
Dungeon Master 02:24:44 Hmm. Yeah. You guys are watching Zario just to make sure he's okay. Um, you sort of, and again, to establish it's, it's stonework floor, you're not seeing footprints or anything. So like, you're like trying to track, isn't going to work as well in here as like tracking prints on a trail, but you sort of give into this feeling, this other sort of crush that you have at your disposal and you do sense that you find the drop, pull you more to the right than the left.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:03 Gotcha. I'll just kind of open my eyes and I'll just indicate to the right. I'll kind of shrug a little.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:27 Like, I don't know why I think it's that way, but it's the way it, you know, it's the way it seems. And I'll keep going that way. Yeah, I'll go down this way and see what I can see.
Dungeon Master 02:25:42 Okay. So I take it you go down instead. Okay. You guys, as you're going down, find this room. And as you're sort of walking towards the entrance, you see that someone thing being, some creature.
Dungeon Master 02:26:04 That's been here before you you see there is like this stone pressed up against the ground depressing this like stone pressure plate on the ground long since triggering a trap you seem to have gone like a paper route and it's just an empty room some.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:08 Okay. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:26:26 old stone slabs up against the wall, long decayed destroyed rugs that are just barely tattered on the ground, but nothing new in this room. Yes. Disturbed at one point, but not freshly disturbed.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:40 Is there, oh, go ahead, sorry.
Leopold Magnus 02:26:43 So it's pretty undisturbed, it seems. OK, so there's no apparent footpath, maybe some dust that was moved or what have you. I do. Go ahead.
Dungeon Master 02:26:58 Give me a perception check for moved dust. If you spend more than 10 minutes, yes.
Leopold Magnus 02:27:06 I was just curious, maybe if I really get down and observe the dust pattern, could I make it an investigation rather than a perception? OK, I'll just spend the time in here while everyone's kind of getting their footing. Oh, a natural 20, baby.
Zariel Torgan 02:27:20 If is that Yeah
Kaladen Shash 02:27:20 Your shoulder is the perception trick too.
Dungeon Master 02:27:32 That's the point. It was the only way you're going to do it because there wasn't much to check. Um, how it's looking with the 21, you're not seeing a whole lot, like with the age of the stone on the outside, like this is a long abandoned place, but I'll break it up in a way that's a little more exciting. Calvin, you find certain drag marks that almost look like as you're like piecing it together, like pose,
Dungeon Master 02:27:57 Being drug so like feet backwards toes like last point of contact of a trail marks. Leading deeper in and as you're sort of discerning this you see leopold's like at the wall looking at stuff and it doesn't make any sense at first but leopold very interestingly enough you find.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:03 you know.
Dungeon Master 02:28:17 like old carvings on the wall depicting some long lost culture of less evolved, but definitely and very obviously like animals, like some of them depicted on four legs, some on two of some culture, long forgotten different animals. You see dogs, cats, pigs, you know, large cow, things like that.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:44 What is this?
Dungeon Master 02:28:47 But you're seeing this artwork depicting this whole culture, almost like a tapestry that faded into the wall. Yeah, very fragile. You don't realize it at first, but you go to brush part of it off, and you almost
Leopold Magnus 02:28:57 Interesting. Pretty hard to spot, I imagine. Then I'll kind of walk up and start to smudge some of the dust away to kind of reveal the carvings into the group. And I'll say, go ahead.
Dungeon Master 02:29:16 brush off like some of the picture itself and so you're a little more careful and it's just like blowing away the depth and you can point it out to your adventuring party.
Leopold Magnus 02:29:26 Well, I suppose this might be the origins of our pal here.
Zariel Torgan 02:29:36 So just to reiterate, I got the feeling that this is the way that we needed to go. But this is an empty room with no other doors, right? Ah, OK, all right. So he sees the depiction on the wall.
Dungeon Master 02:29:48 There is a hallway leading into darkness over here.
Kaladen Shash 02:29:53 Perfect. Let's move forward.
Zariel Torgan 02:30:05 Do we want to spend any more time with that? I mean, it seems somewhat significant. Or do we think that with the natural 20, we got what we were going to get out of that? What do you guys think? I mean, I think
Kaladen Shash 02:30:23 We can look at the picture more. Let's see if we're trying to be taught a lesson. Right, but it also sounded like some ancient, like, culture that we're just unaware of. Some on all fours. I'm just worried about, like, werebeasts, creatures more than anything. Let's see what we run into. That's all.
Zariel Torgan 02:30:33 He got a, he got a natural. Yeah. I guess I'm just thinking that. Okay. Gotcha. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:30:53 We'll be continuing then. Peace.
Zariel Torgan 02:31:05 Well, I'll move up across here, see what I can see down the hall.
Dungeon Master 02:31:16 You see another room that has three other sort of hallways. Directly ahead of you is a staircase leading down, and then the room to the left and the right seem to be on the same level.
Zariel Torgan 02:31:35 Indigo Montoya with his sword, using his dad's spirit to guide him to the Pit of Despair. Just kind of feel my way. How do I feel?
Kaladen Shash 02:31:39 Love it.
Dungeon Master 02:31:49 You feel as though directly ahead is the way you want to go. And you guys see Zariel is very much being drawn in, very supernatural. Up to you if you trust him, but he is sort of letting you know that this way is kind of where you want to go.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:03 I was just thinking that it's like, yeah, this is all above board. This is all fine. And nothing's going to happen that's bad. Yeah, I'll just keep trucking. I'll get along down here and see what I see.
Kaladen Shash 02:32:14 It's all going to be great. Yes, right behind you. Let's continue to follow.
Dungeon Master 02:32:32 Nice. Don't go that way, but you do see more as you walk by. You walk into here and you see a room with sort of like staircases that both equally rise, but in different directions.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:56 Alright, I'll pull out my staff, use it as a divining rod, and see which way it's telling me.
Dungeon Master 02:33:05 Just a different use every time. See, Wesley up behind you goes, man, you guys, you don't really look around, do you? You find that when you hit this point, the pole is very equal, as if both areas lead to the same next space.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:29 Interesting. Well, you make a good point, Wesley. Do you guys want to, and I'll switch to common, do you guys want to check out some of these other rooms, see if there's any other cool stuff, or do you want to just get the...
Kaladen Shash 02:33:44 Can I, yeah, can I peek what's up here real quick before we advance?
Dungeon Master 02:33:50 Yeah, up in this room, give me an investigation or perception check. Yeah, anybody who wants to make one can make one.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:57 I'll go aid, so I'll give you advantage. All right. 24.
Leopold Magnus 02:34:02 Can I take an investigation check? Moving on, good.
Kaladen Shash 02:34:13 Not awesome, 18, got a 28 from Leopold.
Dungeon Master 02:34:25 1813 2424 is pretty good not a hard thing to miss in this room you find there is like.
Dungeon Master 02:34:33 some old skeleton of some sort of animal humanoid in the back uh in the long past uh long since like there's no tissue on it no hair it's just a complete skeleton at this point um seems to be like some sort of large rodent type creature with like the way the skull looks but the interesting is um with the 24 that zariel notices is the back of the skull
Kaladen Shash 02:34:44 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:35:01 sort of top posterior area, like at the top of the back, is a perfectly carved hole in the top of the skull.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:10 Oh, shit. I mean, I don't know what that is. Azariel. OK. Never mind. Sorry. I would like to use my, let's see if I put it in my inventory. I don't think it's in there yet.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:40 It's my new item that allows me to cast Speak with the Dead, even with animals without a mouth. And I would like to... well, I'll let everybody know that's what I'm thinking. So I'll say, well, what do you guys think? I got this thing, I think I can talk to this rat man.
Dungeon Master 02:35:51 Mm-hmm. Does that count as a question? Yes. Why? Yes.
Kaladen Shash 02:36:02 Yes. Be quick. What? What was I at?
Zariel Torgan 02:36:05 Maybe we should come up with some questions before I cast it, that way we don't get into some comical situation where I accidentally ask the wrong ones. I mean, I think we should see what killed him, for one. If he thinks it's still a threat.
Kaladen Shash 02:36:32 How long ago did he die? Where is, when is he from?
Zariel Torgan 02:36:35 Mmm, good one. Mmm, yeah, yeah. What can you banch? Yeah. And then, uh, what do you think, Leo? What do you think we should ask this guy? Ooh.
Leopold Magnus 02:36:52 Hmm. Well, maybe you should ask him if there's any, you know, important buried treasure in here. This seems like quite a symbolic place. Maybe ask him if there's something useful around here.
Zariel Torgan 02:37:05 Yeah, ask him where the loot is. I feel like he might be inclined to not help us grave rob, but I don't know. I don't think they have to tell me the truth. I guess I don't know that necessarily, I've never cast a spell before. Do I get 3 or do I get 5? That was my thought.
Kaladen Shash 02:37:05 Yes.
Dungeon Master 02:37:26 I believe, speaking of that, that is five. Let me find it. It was a shell necklace.
Zariel Torgan 02:37:32 Okay. Alright, um, can you briefly remind me of the nature of the item? Was it a necklace? Or was it a... Okay. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:37:54 You can use the action to cast the Speak With Dead spell without expending a spell slot. Targeted Corpse does not require a mouth as the voice of the deceased is heard from within the shell.
Zariel Torgan 02:38:06 Oh, it's heard from the shell, so everybody can hear it. That's cool. That's different. Okay. Yeah, so I guess I will, I'll rub on the shell three times and speak the magic phrase, what's up? And then activate it.
Dungeon Master 02:38:28 Up to five. That's correct, okay. You see, what is sort of the color of Zariel's magic? You guys see these flickering, I mean, oddly gorgeous and beautiful flames of like this iridescent, constantly moving colorations over these like,
Zariel Torgan 02:38:39 So it's kind of that iridescent like oil sheen color that kind of
Dungeon Master 02:38:58 What looks like flame in the eye sockets of this skull is like the power ignites within it and you see the corpse sort of gets an air about it and you hear a breath come from within the shell letting you know that your spell has taken place.
Zariel Torgan 02:39:18 Yeah, so I guess I'll start off with, you know, how did you die? What killed you? Well, that's one question. Well, I said it in an accent. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:39:30 So one or two? It was one. It was one. Hear that? As it breathes in and he goes, I know some monstrous form. Mouth tentacles.
Zariel Torgan 02:39:55 I'm so excited. Okay. All right. All right. How long have you been dead? Oh, shit. I don't know. What year is it?
Dungeon Master 02:40:16 What year is it? Yeah, 1010 post dome construction or something like that.
Kaladen Shash 02:40:22 1050 something after home creation. It's not going to be a. But it's not going to. It's not going to be a great reference point for that guy. It's we just said we didn't think there were people outside the dome.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:31 I say that. Can I get can I tell him like what constellation is in or something? Is there like some sort of like, rubric that would be more fitting for the average non dome related person?
Dungeon Master 02:40:46 Um, yeah, I mean, you've been living underneath an artificial sky for your whole life. You have no frame of reference for like, how to describe time, you can take a breather and ask. Maybe Wesley's got some answers for you.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:02 Yeah, yeah, I'll whisper to Wes. I'll tell somebody else to ask him because I don't want it to accidentally count as a question.
Kaladen Shash 02:41:07 Wesley, what year is it, buddy? Wesley, what year is it now? Rabbit?
Dungeon Master 02:41:23 Well, shit. I mean, I've been alive for like five, ten years. And my father died not too long ago and I've been for 15 generations. We track season, sure.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:30 He's gonna have like rabbit ears. Jesus Christ.
Kaladen Shash 02:41:39 Wesley, let me stop you right there for a second. OK, let me stop you right there. Do you not keep common calendars, something to mark passage of time? Do you not? I never heard that. Yeah. OK, OK.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:55 They never had the priests. They never had the, was it the Catholics? Is that who did it? Yeah. Oh man. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:42:01 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:42:06 I mean, I could tell you that cottonwood has been around for 100 cycles or so. Cottonwood's where I'm from. You guys asked me about it yesterday.
Kaladen Shash 02:42:12 Are there certain, tell me this, are you, who's Cottonwood? Oh, very good, sorry, sorry. Is there any description of certain eras, like old stories where they describe certain times, events?
Zariel Torgan 02:42:33 Can't can't do that.
Dungeon Master 02:42:37 You see as much as like a bunny face could relay, just like a like a just like a thin lip smile of like, I don't know what to tell you right now is not. He says a word that most closely translates to like nomadic in lifestyle like you just you're asking questions about things that don't matter.
Kaladen Shash 02:42:47 Dario, we'll just skip this one. Yeah. Yeah, let's just see what he says, because he answered our question with the question, what year is it? Just when did he die? He should just tell us straight up here. Or time, like how do they describe that time period?
Zariel Torgan 02:43:10 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'll tell him. So I guess I said, how long has he been dead? And he's like, what year is it? Don't all ghosts know what time it is? Damn it. I don't want to waste this stupid question. I'm just going to drop that line of questioning. His body seems pretty decayed, right?
Kaladen Shash 02:43:29 Mm-hmm. That's fine. That's fine. Very much. Long time. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:43:30 No. Completely scalloped. No tissue on.
Zariel Torgan 02:43:41 Yeah. So I mean, this guy's been this way for like a while. OK. All right. So we got what killed him. We could do some research on that based on the information he gave me. I mean, I know what it is, but we don't as a group. So when did he die? We had a question about treasure. What was another question we wanted to ask?
Leopold Magnus 02:44:12 We should ask him if there's any traps in here.
Zariel Torgan 02:44:15 Mmm, well, he's been dead for so long. I feel like the only information we're gonna get from him is You know like About this society, you know, like you said like like treasure like where's the Treasury or something like that? Or you know things that were relevant when he was alive like a thousand years ago, whatever it was So is that what you guys think like Treasury like, uh, you know
Kaladen Shash 02:44:19 Yeah, let's just ask the treasure. Why do you wander in there? Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:44:45 When you do speak with dead, they can lie to you, right? They can't? Or they can choose not to tell you? So for hostile to it.
Kaladen Shash 02:44:49 No. They can choose not to tell the person that killed them or they can choose not to talk to them. Oh. There you go. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:44:51 The corpse only knows what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. The answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy.
Dungeon Master 02:45:12 doesn't return a creature's soul to its body, only animating its spirit. So it cannot learn new information. So if you had asked, if you had told it what year it was, it wouldn't have had reference for it. So that would have been a good reason to drop that.
Zariel Torgan 02:45:26 Okay. Okay. Okay. Well, I don't think it would have any reason to be hostile with us. So I guess I'll just be like, because he doesn't know that it's not like still the same year. We've got some, we've got some, uh,
Dungeon Master 02:45:48 Nope. Let me see deeper then. All stones kept in the vault.
Zariel Torgan 02:45:51 uh, valuables we need kept safe, uh, where, where in the city would I, would I put this to, to keep it safe? Where, where is your guys' treasury or armory or, or vault? Hmm.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:21 So just to clarify, he said all stones kept in the vault? All right. You reading that spell description didn't help me out at all, because I feel like the answer got more cryptic. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:46:21 What did he say, Stella?
Kaladen Shash 02:46:26 Yeah. OK, so we know. Well, we do know there is a central location of well, so that did answer question. There is that we know it's there. We don't know where it is. That's fine.
Dungeon Master 02:46:26 Yes. No, I had planned that.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:51 Yeah, it's going to be rocks, though. It's going to be a pile of rocks. It's going to be a rock society that loves rocks. They're going to be like, this is a real shiny one. OK, what's one last question? What's one more thing that we want to ask him? Maybe like, what's his favorite color? Oh, well, he didn't even know what it was.
Kaladen Shash 02:47:12 What will protect us from what killed you? Oh, that's right. Whenever we said what killed you, you said, I don't know. Right, right. Yeah. No.
Zariel Torgan 02:47:21 I mean, yeah, he was like, it's like some monster or something like with tentacles, you know, and which we can do some research on, but, um, maybe are we gonna, are we going to do anything about it? Yeah. Um,
Leopold Magnus 02:47:33 We could ask him what his dying wish is. I don't know. It doesn't matter.
Zariel Torgan 02:47:49 Uh, yeah, sure. Wait, Kaladin, did you have a real question before I ask him what his dying wish is? Alright, alright. Well, I'll just reach out and I'll grab his bone hand, and I'll hold it sincerely, and I'll say, uh, what was your dying wish?
Kaladen Shash 02:47:56 No, I don't have real questions. That's fine. Let's see how this goes.
Dungeon Master 02:48:10 You don't know if it's just luck or a wind that blew in at the right time, but his other skeletal hand seems to like fold and fall onto the top of your hand. And so he goes, hold my kids and fuck my partner one more time.
Leopold Magnus 02:48:32 Oh, dear. Wow. Oh, boy.
Zariel Torgan 02:48:35 All right, I'll see if I can do that for you. And then I think he de-animates, right? That's five. Oh. OK, I think you're right. OK.
Dungeon Master 02:48:44 Yeah, everything falls flat, the head falls forward. I thought that was four. You asked what killed him, when he died, loot, and dying wish. So he's got one more.
Kaladen Shash 02:48:54 Yep. Oh. Ask him if. Well, ask him what he was seeking in the city. Ask him what he was trying to do here.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:02 I don't know, what do you guys think? Should we ask for...
Zariel Torgan 02:49:14 Well, I think, I mean, well, maybe I could ask one of you guys to do the mental gymnastics on this because I'm not smart. Maybe one of you guys could, like, make a check to see if his bones match the decay of the city. Or do you guys think that he was here and it was a ruin when he was here too? Yeah. Gotcha. That's a good call, actually.
Kaladen Shash 02:49:24 I think he was here when it was already ruined. I don't think there were creatures rampant in the city.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:44 Yeah, yeah, I'll ask him what were your goals coming to these ruins?
Dungeon Master 02:49:58 the breath one last time before the whole thing almost comes out as an exhale. But just in the one swift breath, he just goes, I managed the grounds in the building. And then the whole thing falls forward, lifeless. And the building. And the building.
Zariel Torgan 02:50:14 He managed the grounds where? He managed the grounds in the building. Oh, oh, oh, okay. He managed, oh. Oh. So if he's managing the ruins and the grounds,
Kaladen Shash 02:50:15 I mean. Before this was a ruin.
Leopold Magnus 02:50:27 There's a grouse here. Does he have anything on his person?
Dungeon Master 02:50:33 No, just skeletons.
Zariel Torgan 02:50:45 Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Yeah, I think this is interesting. You know, okay. Maybe we go check out that other hallway or what do you guys think?
Kaladen Shash 02:51:06 Yes, let's see what we see. Yeah, I'll go peek around the corner.
Dungeon Master 02:51:14 Okay, you leave this lifeless corpse there. Are you talking down here or forward? No, just bones. Leopold already checked for them. You peek over there and you find,
Zariel Torgan 02:51:18 Do you have any cool shit on him? Okay. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:51:40 that you can see a little bit more, but this hallway ends in a very heavy looking stone door with no handle keyholes or anything. Just a slight area where you could probably like get a light grip at the bottom. All phones kept in the vault.
Zariel Torgan 02:51:57 What was the answer when I asked about the valuables? He said all stones kept in the vault. Okay. Okay. What do you guys think? You want to mess with that door? Down by Kaladin?
Kaladen Shash 02:52:04 are in the vault. Over here. Yes.
Leopold Magnus 02:52:21 Where's the door? Yeah, I can maybe do an investigation and see if there's any traps or maybe a lock we could pick. Maybe some kind of cannon.
Kaladen Shash 02:52:33 We don't see any luck, no luck. Perhaps this door responds to something else. Are there any markings around the wall, over the door? Any markings, any root?
Dungeon Master 02:52:50 Looking it over, all you see truly, again and again, is just at the bottom of the base of this stone door seems to be enough space where you could get your hand into.
Kaladen Shash 02:53:11 does it seem feasible to like does it look like the door mechanically would slide up with how it's engaged with the wall yes perhaps we can sort of use mechanical advantage for this leverage
Leopold Magnus 02:53:11 I'll make. Maybe we can get all of us on that door or at least two and try and try and hoist it up.
Dungeon Master 02:53:18 That seems feasible, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:53:27 Yeah, yeah. Do we see anything around here that would look like a clue or some other way to open it? Or is it just straight stone and wall?
Dungeon Master 02:53:51 I mean, just giving you the answer in the most vague way. It looks like if one person was strong enough, they could probably lift it.
Zariel Torgan 02:53:58 Okay. Well, how about, uh... Well, my strength is zero, but I'll try. Yeah, my... Shit, that's better than mine. Do you want me to... I'll guide you. Yeah, guidance. So you gotta...
Kaladen Shash 02:54:01 A couple of this will play. Who's got, who's got the strengths? You've got, you're the strongest, yeah, you're the strongest, so have you. Pick the daughter.
Leopold Magnus 02:54:10 Uh at 15 Oh wow, okay Yeah, you'll spot me
Kaladen Shash 02:54:26 Do you want me to go ahead and roll a strength check as well to assist in the lifting of the door to lower the DC, or how can I do that? Lift with your legs, my friend.
Dungeon Master 02:54:32 If you have any way to help him, you can, but it seems like only one person can really get like in enough of a position to be effective against it. So it'll be one person rolling.
Zariel Torgan 02:54:46 Yeah, I'll cast Guidance. Yeah, and then we can close it and leave him.
Leopold Magnus 02:54:48 Yeah, maybe we can send Peter Rabbit underneath the door and he can scout it out for us if I don't quite get it open all the way. Oh, well, chap, you should be more adventurous. Maybe there's a latch back there. You could let it open and we could all come in, you know?
Kaladen Shash 02:54:59 Wesley.
Dungeon Master 02:55:00 Yeah, exactly. You see, the first thing he goes to say is, yeah, I mean, no offense, but if you lift that barely and I scurry under and you drop it, I don't know where the fuck that goes. I'm sorry, since walking in here, the only thing we've seen is skull. Like, um, don't tell me to be more adventurous. I ran away. Remember that about me? I ran.
Kaladen Shash 02:55:28 All right, we're on the way. Okay, Wesley, very good. Can I get down low and like watch the crack as it lifts up? Who's the athletics check for? Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:55:31 OK. Oh, I thought it was for you to look under the door, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:55:37 Yeah, I cast Guidance. It's gotta be Leo, right? Yeah, I want to stick something
Dungeon Master 02:55:37 Yeah, go ahead and give me an athletics check. Leopold's doing it right. Athletics, not acrobat.
Kaladen Shash 02:55:59 Yeah, please think. He's tumbling on his way to the door. Yeah, that'd be boring.
Zariel Torgan 02:56:07 I think they're the same, aren't they? Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:56:09 Oh, athletics, sorry. I think it would. Yeah, it's the same as plus 2. 16. It is, yeah, plus 2.
Dungeon Master 02:56:13 And you have a D4 from guidance. 16. Is it the same bonus? Okay. 16 isn't enough to lift the door, but I will say 16 is enough that, Calvin, go ahead and give me a perception check as the door is briefly up high enough for you to see.
Dungeon Master 02:56:41 just like as it comes back down. 15, it's super dark in there. You do have dark vision, but even in sort of the gray scale and almost pitch blackness, all you can make out is there seems to be some sort of central table, platform, something in the center of the room, and it seems pretty empty otherwise.
Kaladen Shash 02:56:44 I see all the things with the 15. The artificial pedestal, that's what I'm hearing.
Zariel Torgan 02:57:10 What's your strength, Kaladin? What's your strength? Yeah. I'll cast Guidance again.
Dungeon Master 02:57:11 And then the doors slammed down. It was an athletics gym.
Kaladen Shash 02:57:14 What's that? A plus one. Let me get under the door. We live together. Was that a strength save check? Is that a check? Is that what we said? Strength check? Athletic strength. Here we go. Let me help. A 12. Very helpful.
Zariel Torgan 02:57:41 You can still make it a 16, which is not enough to open it.
Dungeon Master 02:57:42 You see with this second attempt to open the door, it gets sort of lifted up a couple inches and it slams down pretty heavy. And you see sort of at the base, at the sides of the walls where it kind of hits the slide of what's like allowing it to go up and down, seems to be cracking a little bit, almost like the door might fail and not be able to be opened if you fail by too much.
Kaladen Shash 02:57:45 Well, the two of us turn it to the other, you know. Yeah. 15.
Kaladen Shash 02:58:12 If we if we live together with work or you're saying the the role I just had was also an independent check, not like. OK. Oh, that's right, that's right. Only one person at a time.
Zariel Torgan 02:58:12 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:58:19 Independent check you the door slams down too much for like if you got underneath it and he let go and you tried to do it and check it probably crash your head. So you like each made your own check there's only enough space for one person to really look but.
Kaladen Shash 02:58:42 OK, let's have some fun. Let me see something real quick. You are a very good tinkerer. You can make what we need. We need tool? Curl bar.
Leopold Magnus 02:58:56 Yeah, is there any way we can get some proper leverage on this? Like, maybe we can try and find a pry bar or some kind of rod later down into the crypt? Oh, that's a good point. Yeah. OK, so I'll kind of sit back over here and lay out my tools, and I'm going to hammer out a large iron pry bar.
Kaladen Shash 02:59:12 Mike. Is there any like large.
Zariel Torgan 02:59:25 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 02:59:26 And I don't know how long that'll take, but.
Dungeon Master 02:59:30 With the magical tinkering, it takes just a couple minutes. You find some scrap metal from your bag that you would take it from ham hocks. And you sort of just like each hammer hit straightens and like shapes it in an almost ungodly way of how quickly it does it. But in a matter of minutes, you have two very usable pry bars.
Kaladen Shash 02:59:54 Can I have found like a large stone or like an old column or anything that's maybe like three feet tall? Like if that way, if we just get the door open enough, I can wedge it in there and we can crawl through the gap. OK.
Zariel Torgan 03:00:13 Mmm.
Dungeon Master 03:00:16 Give me an investigation check. 19. You find a stone that seems like it is pretty usable. It's like the most round, tallest, seems like the best. I'm just going to do a roll to myself to see.
Kaladen Shash 03:00:27 19. How flawless this perfect stone is.
Dungeon Master 03:00:46 If it is good. Oh yeah, how much it's gonna last? OK, you find a stone seems good enough as far as you can tell. So the next check can be the DC is lower by 5 and you can. One person can make the check with advantage. You've got it.
Kaladen Shash 03:01:02 OK. Yeah, Rex, I think you're still, you're still a strong man.
Zariel Torgan 03:01:12 And I'd still like to guide whoever it is. Yeah, I'm plus a d4.
Leopold Magnus 03:01:15 Yay. Got that plus two, yeah. Well, okay, I guess I better give this one more shot. And I kind of stretch out a little bit. Get the pry bar underneath there. I placed the rock kind of up against the base of the pry bar, so I got a good leverage point. And it's with advantage, you said?
Dungeon Master 03:01:37 Mm-hmm, with advantage. DC is lower by five. This time you don't even get the door.
Leopold Magnus 03:01:42 With advantage plus a D4, that was, and then was there also a plus five? Where did I mention that? Ah, okay, got it. Jesus Christ, 15.
Kaladen Shash 03:01:52 Please lower. God. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:02:03 more than a couple inches off the ground before it slams shut too heavy. And you see the framing sort of cracks a little bit. The DC has gone up by one.
Leopold Magnus 03:02:17 Well, I don't know if I have the elbow grease for this one, gents. Yeah, it's advantage plus guidance. I just rolled terribly. Here.
Kaladen Shash 03:02:22 OK, let me try one more time. We have the guidance plus. OK. Unfortunately. Unfortunate rules. Well, not much better. Let's see posted before. 1616
Dungeon Master 03:02:33 Yeah, that was less of a Leopold thing and more of the dice. Oh.
Zariel Torgan 03:02:36 Yeah, absolutely.
Leopold Magnus 03:02:48 You rolled a 13 and you literally rolled the same set of dice, but then just slightly better on the, that's before.
Kaladen Shash 03:02:55 Yep.
Dungeon Master 03:02:56 You see with this third failure, you lift the door up, and this time, Kaladin gets enough of lifting with his back, hands behind him, the door gets high enough that you slide the rock underneath, and then as it drops down to the rock, the whole door and mechanism
Dungeon Master 03:03:16 breaks and goes off hinge and the stone shatters but the door slams down and like the frame collapses into it and you give it a couple pulls and there is there is no way you're lifting this up made out of stone no the whole thing is busted
Leopold Magnus 03:03:28 All right, is this made out of stone?
Kaladen Shash 03:03:29 So what, so it's, so there's no way to, there's no way to crawl through it now? Like I'm, okay, so the door, so it's not that everything collapsed. The slab is now just closed in a manner that we can't manipulate it. Okay.
Dungeon Master 03:03:47 Yes, mechanically you failed too many times and you cannot go through the designed way, but you could still probably figure out a different way to get in here. That is the case of this door.
Leopold Magnus 03:03:55 So after all of that happens, Leopold unsheathes his sword and you hear a crackling of energy. I'm going to activate the Unstoppable, which will allow me to slice through a door or surface as long as it's less than three feet thick. Is that the case for this door?
Zariel Torgan 03:03:55 Yeah Yeah, I was gonna say
Kaladen Shash 03:04:13 So we need to go take a lightsaber mountain through the heat.
Leopold Magnus 03:04:16 Yep, I'm just going to insert it into the center. And you see the door starting to glow in the center. It's taking quite some time, but eventually my saber emerges through and I start to cut a small door within that door.
Dungeon Master 03:04:17 It's just been a menace moment.
Dungeon Master 03:04:37 So cool. He plunged the saber into the wall and at first he doesn't feel like it did anything and it's just like a handle pressed up against you but then you see the work stone starts glowing first very faintly and then brighter and brighter and brighter and this bright orange red coloration then starts to give way and the form melts as the door starts giving away this hole that he then drags sideways cutting through the stone
Dungeon Master 03:05:04 cutting out a doorway, and it takes some time, but if you work with it enough, eventually you find that Leopold has cut a people-sized hole in this large slab of stone. Good use.
Kaladen Shash 03:05:18 OK, very good. Nice job with plasmonite. What's next, my friend? Just imagine we kept palm planting.
Leopold Magnus 03:05:23 Well, that should do the trick.
Zariel Torgan 03:05:27 It'd be funny if this was the vault and it had like five copper, but because of inflation, that was like a lot back then.
Dungeon Master 03:05:37 Awesome. This will be the last thing we do. We'll stop it right here, but I'll describe what you guys see. You cut into this door, you open it up and it reveals like a black room beyond it. You, either with some light source or just your dark vision, which would you guys like to use?
Kaladen Shash 03:06:00 i mean i think if does everyone have dark vision now under right after your yeah yep well dark vision will show up right underneath your senses your passive
Leopold Magnus 03:06:06 I'm not sure if I do, let me, where would that pop up? Like background features and traits? Oh, no, no, nothing for me.
Zariel Torgan 03:06:06 I think so.
Dungeon Master 03:06:08 Like on the first page, I'm pretty sure.
Kaladen Shash 03:06:24 Perception, insight, investigation underneath saving throws and dark vision should be listed there if you have it. Okay, I guess it's just gonna be dark vision that we're assessing this with right now because I don't have a light so I can readily light. Almost.
Leopold Magnus 03:06:39 Okay. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:06:40 If you don't light something, it just changes what you see. But using just your dark vision, you're looking into this room, you see this stone slab, this pedestal in the very center, and on it, evenly spaced out, are five thin but very nicely worked stone cups, each filled with a different liquid, but you see it all in just shades of gray.
Kaladen Shash 03:07:05 Excellent, some sort of puzzle my friend.
Leopold Magnus 03:07:09 I'll strike a torch up and kind of try and get a look at what's going on in there, because I can't see anything. I have a dark vision.
Dungeon Master 03:07:19 Awesome. You light the torch, and it's a very plain room in itself. It was maybe nice at one time, but it's been so long, but not even like curtains or tapestries hang anymore. But somehow, in this perfectly preserved area, you have these tubs, each spaced out from each other in sort of a pentagon shape. And you see in the runes written in Sylvan, Leopold being the one who can't read it,
Dungeon Master 03:07:48 It reads like in the equivalent of all personnel must drink from the green cup. That is what it says.
Kaladen Shash 03:07:57 All personnel must drink from the green cup. Hey, slow down. Stop it, my friend. Cut it out. It's not supposed to be. Don't drink that. You don't know what it is. Just sit.
Leopold Magnus 03:08:03 Oh, what are you gents sposes up with these cups? And I just grab a random one off the table and I'm about to take a big swig. Oh wait, what seems to be the issue? I'm quite thirsty. I was going to throw one of these back. Oh, okay. I suppose if you insist.
Kaladen Shash 03:08:27 Just set it down for a moment. Let's figure this out. My goodness. Other than other than the description of all personnel must drink. The green do we see any other crests? Emblems like there's there's obviously this is this used to be some. Personnel implies an organization or.
Kaladen Shash 03:08:57 Group or business or army or. Just different colors there in a sense. Can we do any other investigating or if you just just kind of tell us what we see? Want to go right there? That's fine. OK, OK.
Dungeon Master 03:09:01 I mean, nothing that stood the test of time with the exception of these cups that are all filled with a small amount, but all equal amounts of different colored liquids. That's all you see.
Zariel Torgan 03:09:09 Do we want to mess with it before?
Dungeon Master 03:09:37 So we can give it another three minutes before 11. No smell to them.
Zariel Torgan 03:09:41 Do you guys wanna... try to drink some of it, or...?
Kaladen Shash 03:09:44 Can we smell? What colors are there other than green? Is it all different colors?
Dungeon Master 03:09:52 It's magical, like if you do spells and stuff, it's not going to make you waste them. You get the sense of magic, but it sort of recalls of what Wesley had told you earlier. They use magic, but it's not the same that you use. It's almost most closely related to like druidic type magic, but totally different line developed over different methods, almost like just convergent theory.
Dungeon Master 03:10:22 It's just some sort of will-based arcana, but there are five cups in a pentagon shape. The top cup, or sort of the top of the point, is green liquid. To the side of that, going down and left, is yellow. Going down from there is red. Going sideways from there is purple. And then going up is blue. And then that should connect you to the green after that.
Zariel Torgan 03:10:29 Can I see if my
Zariel Torgan 03:10:57 feelings that have been guiding me, guide me towards any of these specifically. If you guys want, I have a spell called Divination, where I could ritual cast 10 minutes and ask some sort of divine presence a question.
Dungeon Master 03:11:02 The feeling pulls you back towards the room that you are no longer in, the one with the two staircases.
Kaladen Shash 03:11:15 For essentially for like a little guidance. Yeah, go for it. Do that before it ends.
Leopold Magnus 03:11:25 Do that thing, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 03:11:30 I'm going to ask, after 10 minutes, I'm going to ask, is drinking that green one a good idea?
Dungeon Master 03:11:47 Let me look up the donation. You ask a single question about a specific goal of interactivity within the next seven days. DM offers a truthful reply. DM might reply a short phrase, cryptic rhyme, or an omen.
Zariel Torgan 03:11:51 So I just read it. Let me see if I can find it. I think it said I can ask one question.
Dungeon Master 03:12:16 you ask this question and you wait sort of as it's sort of pushed off into the ether and eventually you see like the faintest bit of like wind brush over the green cup and it sort of ripples and you just get like the scent of
Dungeon Master 03:12:37 sweet flowers and light rain, a very pleasant smell, nothing that gives you a concerning feeling. You see that even if when Zariel goes to drink a little bit, half of the fluid disappears out of the cup.
Zariel Torgan 03:12:48 I'll drink some of it. Ah, shit.
Leopold Magnus 03:13:05 Well, Keller didn't he just let this old chap take whatever drink he wants? I was thirsty and he just reached out and grabbed something. All I saw was him stand here and squint for some time and next thing I know he's drinking this cup.
Kaladen Shash 03:13:16 Yes, but he did his little Jedi moment before he did something, so it felt like okay, you know, I'll do this. Yes, I see the hypocrisy. I'm sorry, my friend.
Dungeon Master 03:13:21 Leopold takes another step and the cup is now empty.
Zariel Torgan 03:13:22 Shit.
Leopold Magnus 03:13:37 Well, give me a swig of that.
Zariel Torgan 03:13:50 Do we feel anything or do you want to pick that up when we play again?
Dungeon Master 03:13:56 No, we can keep going. There are four of you present. Two people have drank in from the green cup. Nothing has happened yet. Cup is empty.
Kaladen Shash 03:14:03 Uh-huh. And the cup is empty now. Are they still holding it? Is it set back down? Does it refill automatically? Like these cups, obviously nobody's been here. It's not like somebody just... Okay.
Dungeon Master 03:14:18 You put the cup back into sort of its little circular in placement. This little outlet doesn't refill or anything. Again, there is a yellow cup, a red cup, a purple cup, and a blue cup.
Zariel Torgan 03:14:34 We should drink another one. I'll drink out of the blue one. Well, not the whole thing. I don't want to drink the whole thing. I mean, I don't know. Yeah, half.
Dungeon Master 03:14:49 You just drink it. You take a drink, half of the liquid disappears.
Zariel Torgan 03:15:09 What do you guys think? Yeah, can we wait?
Leopold Magnus 03:15:20 Well, I wouldn't get too carried away. One of these was probably good enough.
Kaladen Shash 03:15:21 I don't know, maybe wait a moment and see if something happens.
Dungeon Master 03:15:34 You wait. Nothing happens. Color theory, color theory.
Zariel Torgan 03:15:41 I'm getting the impression that we're probably supposed to do it in some sort of order or for some specific reason. Maybe we'll come back to it when we get more. Yeah, I'm just trying to think of mixing colors to make something specific, but I can't think of any information we've got.
Kaladen Shash 03:15:51 I think there's something we're missing, but yes. Yellow. Yellow and blue to get green. This is the only thing I could think of doing, yes.
Dungeon Master 03:16:09 Yeah, what do you mix to get green?
Zariel Torgan 03:16:17 Wait, I thought. Oh. So then I'll drink some yellow. That, I do that.
Kaladen Shash 03:16:20 Yellow, blue, yellow, blue, make green. Mix the two together first, then you drink.
Dungeon Master 03:16:33 Good. If you would drink in the yellow, you would not have had enough to complete the puzzle and you guys were going to get locked out. Failing the second thing. You mix them together and you get almost a full glass of a green fluid.
Kaladen Shash 03:16:54 Excellent. Small sip. See what happens. Perfect. We definitely drank good protection potion. This is good. Good almond.
Dungeon Master 03:16:58 the remaining two of you take a sip of the green fluid and you hear nowhere that you can see, but somewhere in the distance you hear a shifting of stone is like a, just like a, as something like sets into the ground and then with a thud stops.
Zariel Torgan 03:17:24 Yeah, I feel good about this.
Leopold Magnus 03:17:27 Well, I was just thirsty. Well, I'd like to imagine I could enjoy it, but, you know, things aren't quite the same as they used to be.
Dungeon Master 03:17:28 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 03:17:31 You don't drink, you just put chicken and stuff down your mouth, man. How old is that rotisserie chicken now? When did you pop that? Can I have a chicken drumstick, please? We can't heat it up? There's no heating on the inside there?
Leopold Magnus 03:17:51 Yeah, I kind of shake one of my arms and out the sleeve pops a drumstick onto the ground. No, no, I think the things that go in just sit there as they were. No digesting. Cool.
Zariel Torgan 03:17:58 Sweet. I am looking forward to this dungeon crawl.
Kaladen Shash 03:18:08 That's fine. Productive. OK, I feel like I have like I have a moderate idea
Dungeon Master 03:18:09 Okay, we'll leave it there though, guys. Undigested chicken noodle. I mean, Jesse, you obviously have a very good idea of what's going to happen. Are you going to keep it a secret or do you want us to talk about it? Okay.
Leopold Magnus 03:18:21 All right, well, that was a lot of fun.
Zariel Torgan 03:18:28 Oh, I'm going to keep it a secret. I'm going to keep it a secret. Something like that. A little different.
Kaladen Shash 03:18:36 one of the few things that would do that or eat a brain that doesn't make a ton of sense or makes me really worried as to what we might find.
Leopold Magnus 03:18:49 A mouse with tentacles that left a perfect hole in somebody's skull. I don't know the monster manual, so this will be a surprise for me. Good point.
Zariel Torgan 03:19:00 Yeah, I think I'm going to wait to see if we could do some research before we talk about it as characters, just because I don't want to throw anything, do anything weird. Okay, all right, that works. Well, we'll figure it out.
Kaladen Shash 03:19:08 Certainly. What Wesley might know of these areas. OK, man, sweet. So everybody OK for next week, and then I'm
Dungeon Master 03:19:09 Well, I don't want to mislead you guys to as far as research and stuff goes, you have no access to any of the resources of the too far away to access any of that. So it'd be like what you could find around your what you already know.
Zariel Torgan 03:19:30 Mm. Oh yeah.
Kaladen Shash 03:19:37 We might have to take a week or two off. It's like Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve. Yeah, missed a few. Shift it to a different day potentially or something.
Leopold Magnus 03:19:42 Yeah, definitely good for next week and then yeah, likewise probably can't the next two weeks after. Unless maybe we wanted to like. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I'll be out of town. I mean, although there's no reason I couldn't play. Yeah, you know what? It's probably just easiest to resume like.
Kaladen Shash 03:20:07 Yeah, yeah. What did we say, January 7th?
Leopold Magnus 03:20:08 that maybe Thursday or Friday after the New Year's, if we did want to shift? Yeah, we could just do the 7th altogether, yeah. Cool. Right on.
Dungeon Master 03:20:10 So next week, two weeks, and then the 7th? OK.
Zariel Torgan 03:20:16 Yeah, that could work for me. Yeah, yeah, let's shoot for that and then we'll decide more as we get closer.

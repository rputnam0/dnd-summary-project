Kaladen Shash 00:00:00 Yes.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:00 Great seems now like a voyeur to me. He's just kind of sitting in the corner like now recording.
Zariel Torgan 00:00:01 I would love, like, at the end of the campaign, a summary of all of our comments about Craig. Like, have it generate, like, a guy, and it's just, like, Channing Tatum. He just likes to listen and watch.
Dungeon Master 00:00:04 I think Craig's on. OK.
Dungeon Master 00:00:34 What happened last session? So, as you guys had been gathering your senses, you found yourselves on the outside of the protective dome of Nunu Arbor. Earlier in the day, you had emerged from an aquatic tunnel after pursuing the cultist Cedric and defeating him. When you emerged, the air was fresh, vibrant, and a landscape sprawled before you bathed in beautiful blue skies and sunlight, a stark contrast to the dangers you had long been warned of lurking outside.
Dungeon Master 00:01:02 You explored this unfamiliar terrain, making your way towards the dome slowly, but surely, when out of nowhere, Leopold spotted a giant amphibian type of monster, an enormous frog he-myth, hunting a giant beetle on a marshland. With excitement, he called out to the group, suggesting a ride on this massive creature would be the way back to the dome. Zariel advised against this, however, saying you should just observe from a safe distance.
Kaladen Shash 00:01:25 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 00:01:32 Despite your attempts to conceal yourselves, the frog Hemith's keen senses picked you up, and it turned its attention towards you. Undeterred, Leopold flipped his all-or-nothing coin, emboldened by his uncertain fortune, and leaped onto the creature's back before looking at what the result was, initiating the entire chaos.
Dungeon Master 00:01:52 Battle commenced, Zariel shifted into his bear form, charged the frog he-myth, getting ready to attack. Kaladin, usually the most precise in the combat, found himself struggling to land a blow, expressing his frustration at the end as his spells kept going wide. Leopold the whole time clung to the creature and eventually launched his steel defender off to join the fight as he just sort of
Zariel Torgan 00:02:01 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:02:15 blasted it from up top and then laid back down. Zariel's lightning strikes also proved fairly effective in stunning the beast at the cost of full damage. Combining your attacks, you finally brought the frog humans down with a beautifully flavored attack of loading the steel defender into your cannon-like... I think you shoot it out of your face, if I remember correctly. You load it in and eject it.
Leopold Magnus 00:02:38 Yeah, my, my, my helmet kind of retracts down so that it's like makes way for a large chest cavity. So I load like a giant cannon.
Dungeon Master 00:02:49 Yeah. You loaded up your steel defender and shot it out like a blade corkscrew blowing through the creature. Leopold insisted on getting a saliva sample.
Kaladen Shash 00:02:58 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:03:03 And then as you had investigated it, you had seen a couple things that caught your attention. Paladin found fragments of cloth around the creature's haunches, suggesting that possibly somebody from the dome had ventured outside before, or maybe the Froghemoth had been in the cave system and had gotten somebody, not totally clear. And then you had also found in the gullet of the Froghemoth, there was a boot lodged in there, raising some more questions, not entirely sure. It is entirely possible that it just
Zariel Torgan 00:03:04 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:03:32 was killing somebody that escaped the dome and maybe escaped the werewolf you guys don't know it was you couldn't like discern it because it had been getting digested but you continued your way on towards where you thought the arcane splitter was on the other side of the dome.
Kaladen Shash 00:03:41 Yep.
Dungeon Master 00:03:48 As you made your way, Kaladin recognized a figure leaned up against the dome that as he got closer recognized and flagged as that fallen Blackguard knight that you had seen on a couple occasions. First was outside of the Emerald Grove when you were stashing the woman you later discovered to be named Fae Lara. And then you also saw him dispatched after Leopold had
Zariel Torgan 00:03:50 Good.
Dungeon Master 00:04:12 dissuaded Lord Marshal Thor from leaving the dome in that attack. He instead sent this fighter, who you guys never saw again.
Dungeon Master 00:04:22 You sort of crept up before realizing fully unconscious, fully unmoving, maybe dead. And then you saw that in its abdomen, where like the giant Clarmarks had torn away its entire chest, it wasn't really, there was no sinew guts mess. There was nothing. It was an intricate system of gears, cogs, arcane sources, machinery, armor pieces.
Dungeon Master 00:04:45 strikingly similar to Leopold's design, but just more compact, condensed, and definitely like a more advanced version of. You guys stashed it in your pocket workshop, made your way. I think you guys even spent a night out there, if I recall correctly, where you took time to, it wasn't the night, you took a short rest.
Kaladen Shash 00:04:48 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:08 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:05:09 Because during the short rest, Kaladin had noticed that beneath the face guard, it was a iron gauntlet crushing a skull sort of etched into the face plate where there would normally be a face that was just flat and where the face mask went over. The identical mark that is on Leopold's back underneath his cloak. This decision...
Kaladen Shash 00:05:26 That was the night, yeah. The whole dude.
Leopold Magnus 00:05:29 That was the night, correct, that had that mark?
Dungeon Master 00:05:33 Yeah, it's like, if you lifted his faceplate instead of being a giant cannon hole where he could shoot somebody out of, there's an etched symbol that's on your back. Kaladin feeling a little stressed by this made- Oh, go ahead. Go for it. Yes. You took the whole dude and put him in the workshop. Because being a Tomaton, if I remember correctly, you guys are like,
Zariel Torgan 00:05:44 So sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. We took the whole dude and put him in the workshop. Oh, OK. OK. All right, cool. Just double checking.
Dungeon Master 00:06:02 it don't know that he's like dead because can he really die in the traditional way and the arcane cores were still powered suggesting there's some sort of minimal energy still flowing um so i think you're taking him back to the city to see if there's something you can do about it i think or leopold just wants something to experiment on we didn't really ask but that was my assumption
Zariel Torgan 00:06:14 Mm-hmm. Gotcha. Yeah, because if we take him back and they fix him up, they're going to be like, hey, so. Oh, OK. OK. All right, cool. Gotcha. Gotcha.
Kaladen Shash 00:06:30 Well, we're not we're not giving it back. We're not giving him back. It's research, it's fun. Yeah, we took him out of our own interest, not out of the interest of. Because remember, we were. I think what we're going to say once we go back the route we came out. Is that we never we never actually exited the cave system, right? Yeah. Oh goodness, no.
Leopold Magnus 00:06:34 Oh, no.
Zariel Torgan 00:06:48 Mm-hmm. Yeah, that was gonna be, yeah, that was gonna be my concern if we were gonna give him back. But if we're not, then I'm totally on board. All right. All right, yeah, go ahead. Continue, Jonathan. Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:06:49 and we'll keep saying yeah. But I'm getting...
Kaladen Shash 00:06:59 Yeah, he's just hanging out with us. Research.
Dungeon Master 00:07:03 um with the sort of rising tensions kaladin made a quick decision and he risked donning the mysterious fey mask that he acquired and defeating cedric and upon waiting wearing it not waiting it you guys witnessed the passage of time slowed everything sort of halted as kaladin lifted off of his feet you saw he went through a physical transformation with
Dungeon Master 00:07:29 His ears elongating and sort of pushing back instead of like just sitting at the side. His features got a little more gone, stretched out. He got a little bit taller, just looks a little more lithe. His hair got like, not quite, it's not just green tinted, but think of it like an iridescent sheen where if you see it from a certain,
Dungeon Master 00:07:55 like perspective where the light hits it you'll see just like it reflects green a little bit like just sort of gives that aura he witnessed the passage of eons go by in mere moments he saw lands get constructed and destroyed and trees grow and fall and he eventually came to be sitting and standing in a open field of like what looked like agricultural wheat um
Kaladen Shash 00:08:02 Nothing.
Dungeon Master 00:08:22 He had a conversation with that mysterious woman where she explained what her name was and how she had finally come for her and then that he had held some importance but she only really spoke in a vague cryptic fashion. Eventually she said, um, don't be silly you know me and upon reading on his face that he had no idea who she was she shared
Dungeon Master 00:08:46 Ah, you don't have all your memories yet. That's okay. There's still time for you to realize your importance before Kaladin snapped back to the present and came back to you guys. Leopold, upon seeing this, made a one-off comment about how Kaladin now resembled his old mentor a little bit more, suggesting that Leopold knows a full elf.
Dungeon Master 00:09:10 You guys, in this moment, talking, going over everything, made an audible decision where you were going to backtrack the full, like, half a day's journey to the cave system and then try to find a way through the caves back to the dome. You did talk about it. It is, I think, established that
Zariel Torgan 00:09:32 you.
Dungeon Master 00:09:34 You guys had gone very deep into the ground, and you had to go deep enough to get below the arcane barrier. And you also need to find a cave system that goes through. So I think that's your next big challenge, as you guys are currently just making your way. You haven't made it to the cave yet. We ended the session with, I am asking you guys to make just one final encounter check that would establish what we started this at. And you guys rolled a natural one.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:03 Yeah, I did that. That's how you want to start the next session. I think you forgot to mention in there, Jonathan, that we got a full rest in, right? Yeah, I've got all my spells, right?
Kaladen Shash 00:10:03 You guys, you guys was sorry. I'll actually, so record, record, record, record, record. I loved it. I loved it. Encounter ready, ready. Yeah. We overnighted. So
Dungeon Master 00:10:08 We don't have to point out names. No, I don't believe you have. You short rested and then you,
Leopold Magnus 00:10:10 You know, I had forgotten about that. And then I reread the summary and I went, Oh shit. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:10:34 No, you short-rested and then you guys started walking is what we established. No, you guys leveled up two sessions ago. Yeah, the only person who had done something, I think you guys had damaged each other being dumb or something like that had happened. There was a reason you guys did certain things.
Kaladen Shash 00:10:38 Let me see my spell slots. Where am I at?
Zariel Torgan 00:10:41 at least level up. No, I haven't rested since the Froghemoth fight. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:47 I haven't used any spells, so I'm not sure. I feel like maybe we have gotten...
Kaladen Shash 00:11:01 Right. I should have, I should have things expended. I think the idea was that we were going to hunker down after we, like we were going to sleep in the, in the, in the toolbox. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:15 Yeah, I thought, I thought. Yeah, I think and maybe I'm wrong. I thought that we had left the dome during the day, got there and it was like kind of late by the time we got all the way to the dude and then rested.
Dungeon Master 00:11:15 Right. But then you guys had distinctly short rest. That was what it was. You did just enough to roll some hit dice. Get back your wild shape is what you had said. And then you guys analyze the stuff and then you left.
Kaladen Shash 00:11:33 That's OK.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:43 because it was going to be too long because if it was a half a day to get there and we fought and you know but if we didn't that's fine i just wanted to make double sure because i'm missing a bunch of spells but i can do it i'm just double checking if it said we didn't then i'm i'm cool i'll make it work
Dungeon Master 00:12:00 Pretty sure you short rested. You might have long rested before you had made your way to the dome, but I'm not sure. Yeah, all the all the receipt. I do know that most recently only short rested because you had made a very specific comment about getting your well shape back, but I don't know.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:01 Let me, yeah, here we go. Okay, let's see. Yeah, that's what I was looking. Yes, you did say at the very end,
Kaladen Shash 00:12:10 What's the transcript say? I love this. Oh my gosh. Oh my God.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:13 Yeah. Get in the comments.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:30 Uh, go ahead. What are you going to say? I think somebody got important and I got cut off. Uh, you guys get your long rest in. So do that. And then somebody give me, because it sounds like the plan was to backtrack into the river. Uh, I think you asked me for a, uh, a dice roll. That's uh,
Kaladen Shash 00:12:41 Yeah. Yeah, because I still had. Yeah, so we so we did long rest. We hunkered down in the toolbox. We're now we've now emerged. Correct during yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:12:43 Perfect, okay. You guys have made the encounter, chickenos, then after woman. Okay. Yeah, yeah, you wanted it for that.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:58 Yeah, I think I remember what you're talking about, Jonathan. I think it was right before we had approached the body, because I didn't know if it was going to be something bad, and I wanted my wild shapes. Yeah, and then I think later we must have gotten the toolbox, because that does sound familiar. OK. All right, well, then I'm going to go ahead and long rest. And then go ahead.
Kaladen Shash 00:13:17 Yeah. This is the DM. Yes, perfect.
Dungeon Master 00:13:17 Mm-hmm. Yeah. Oh, I figured it out. Don't you worry. Okay, guys, so get your long rest in then. Don't let me rob you of that.
Leopold Magnus 00:13:21 Jonathan, I think your final remarks were, I got a whole week to decide what I got to do to you with a natural one. So hopefully you figured out something good. Anyways.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:32 And then we also, we also leveled them, right? Using the transcripts. Damn it. That's fair.
Dungeon Master 00:13:51 No. Okay, you'd have my number on that one if it was, but... I'm consciously trying to keep you without leveling too much before, you know, hopefully we get Travis in here. I don't want him to, like, start in so late.
Kaladen Shash 00:13:52 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 00:13:54 That was not in the transcripts, unfortunately.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:14 Oh yeah, do we have any news on that front?
Dungeon Master 00:14:18 I gave him, I was telling Rex this, I went through on Sunday and I took all of the transcripts, not the transcripts, but the summaries, like our long ones, and I condensed them all down. And then I put all those summaries together into like one cohesive, summary one, two, three, four through 12. And there are only like a few paragraphs each and they're short paragraphs. And I made that document and I sent it to Travis and then I sent him the link to the notebook so he can read stuff that way.
Kaladen Shash 00:14:41 Yeah. That's good.
Dungeon Master 00:14:47 I read through the whole summary thing. It took me like 12 minutes. So it's like much shorter than reading the book that we have going so far. And then he asked me today at work what the party dynamic was as far as like fighters versus casters. So he's building a character it seems like. Or putting it in his brain when he wants to build. Maybe Tuesday he joins?
Zariel Torgan 00:14:47 OK. Yeah. OK, sweet. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, awesome.
Kaladen Shash 00:15:14 What, you think as early as next week? Okay, right, all right, try it. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:15:16 I asked him about this week and he said. Probably next week was more likely. He's a lot of fun to play with, so it just he'll tell you. Well. Yeah, very funny. Always for the joke. Anyway, back to you guys long rested. You're making your way back.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:24 Awesome. Yeah, I like Travis. He's a good player, very creative.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:36 That's going to be awesome.
Dungeon Master 00:15:43 No problems. Weather is beautiful. You're making your way through the grass plains. It takes a few hours. Borders on four to five-ish, not quite. Maybe you could do it in three and a half. But eventually, you do find your way back to that cave system. And then I'll just pause here. You guys had a good chunk of day to talk or do something, if you would like, if you guys want to do that before I keep moving you. But you guys.
Dungeon Master 00:16:14 You make it most of your travel without any issue.
Leopold Magnus 00:16:19 Yeah, I think.
Kaladen Shash 00:16:19 I think I would just, I think I would just make sure that I, I'm sure during part of that I would have shared the vision that I had again and what the lady elf had said, or the voice had said to me in the, in the dream or at least while the mask was on the vision.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:39 Would you have had time by now to have a more fully realized idea of what that mask could do? Like, do you have an item? Is that something? Well, I mean, if you want to, you don't have to. I was just, you know, if you were.
Dungeon Master 00:16:50 He's just late. Had you checked it out yet? Oh nice, you have a student. But right, he's out, you told me that.
Kaladen Shash 00:16:54 Uh, yeah, the name. Yeah, no, I can. Uhm? Oh no, 100%. You know, John, I read it at work, said I have the student all week. I was. I was fangirling. Well, it's Chris's student, so he's just with me this week. Yeah, yeah. So I was reading it as fantastic.
Kaladen Shash 00:17:23 No, I was pausing, Jesse, or Zario, because I was trying to get into my voice. I have to, like, think about words for a second. Not hesitating to share. Yeah. It really just depends. I have this funny story, like when we bought Boda, it was from this family that owned a farm in Camas.
Dungeon Master 00:17:30 Oh, funny. What is your guys' part word?
Zariel Torgan 00:17:34 Yes.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:36 Get your start word. That's funny.
Kaladen Shash 00:17:52 And I just distinctly remember we texted back and forth. It was great. And then I called him. He was like, yes, what do you want? We have the puppies. I was like, I was like, oh, my God. I was like, oh, my God, we're going to buy dogs from the Russian mafia. What do you want to do with the puppies? It just works out.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:07 Oh, that's so funny.
Leopold Magnus 00:18:08 That's your trigger word? Oh, that's good. There you go.
Kaladen Shash 00:18:16 I, yes, yes, the name of this mosque is called Breath of the Feywild. It's, I seem to have a very strong connection with it. I think soon I will remember everything, but it feels, feels very familiar to part of me. And it seems, seems to have brought out a stronger connection with, with my ancestry, my Elf.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:47 Yeah, it does seem to be the case. Interesting.
Leopold Magnus 00:18:54 I'm gonna walk over to Kaladin and thwang one of his long ears and be like, oh boy, Kaladin, we really need to fatten you up. Are you feeling all right? You seem a little bit different. I don't know if the Legion is going to recognize you when we get back.
Dungeon Master 00:19:06 Oh, he took the mask off. Remember, he did not turn to stone.
Kaladen Shash 00:19:09 It's, I did not feel like frog legs. I feel, I feel, well, yeah, no, I don't, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't, I don't have to have that on, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:24 Oh shit, I didn't even think about that. You're supposed to be wearing that mask that the guy was wearing. Oh yeah. Where'd you get that? Is there a warm-up time? Or you throw it on and it's just boom?
Dungeon Master 00:19:36 But when he gets the ability. So I did very specifically, I think, right in there for Bren to know that you gain of the passives that it gives you. But to do its active stuff, it has to be on your face. So it's on. Because, and Jesse, you remember this, this is the first item of the campaign that's an heirloom item.
Kaladen Shash 00:19:56 It's just boom. And then you're considering the active
Zariel Torgan 00:20:01 Oh. Yeah. Interesting. Absolutely. OK, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:20:05 It is out in like important item. So it is still bound. It is not attuned. He can get the benefits of it. But it has certain effects that only work when it's on a space. And, um.
Kaladen Shash 00:20:26 the interwoven roots, the vine lash, and the emerald blessing. Oh, I didn't see the resist. Oh, it's at the very bottom there. No, wait. Oh, I do see that. Yeah. OK. OK.
Dungeon Master 00:20:34 Like it gives you resistance to poison damage, things like that. But consider like the face site is like a path. I should just go through and re-edit it and put passive versus active. I'll do that to make it easier and not confusing in the future.
Kaladen Shash 00:20:57 Oh. That's perfect, it's really funny. The very last line it says subjects I can party member. Is subject to a charisma saving throw within the eyeliner of Kaladin. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:21:12 Yeah so like I was thinking about it the original item that like I had took some of the inspiration from had just like basically the equivalent of fey ancestry which you already have where you have advantage on charisma saving thrust against being charmed and so I was like how can I make this different and exciting I was like so you can now project that
Kaladen Shash 00:21:27 Yeah, yeah. Extend that ability. That's cool. It's really, really cool. That's super cool. I like that. So that's not a distance thing, though. I could be 120 feet as long as I got sight. OK, cool. That's cool. OK, that's cool.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:28 Hmm. Interesting. I like that.
Dungeon Master 00:21:35 Where if you see somebody get subjected to a charisma saving throw for being charmed, I should specify, you can give them advantage if you can see them. No, if you can see them, you can do that.
Leopold Magnus 00:21:55 Brilliant.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:57 Awesome. So now for the ancient dragon.
Kaladen Shash 00:21:58 Cool yeah, that was my only question there. Cool.
Dungeon Master 00:22:04 how that works for Leopold and Zariel. This is like more of a me discretion thing. Once I find a good beat for it, I put it in. So you might get yours made way later, but they're all going to be kind of equally powerful in the end. There's going to be a very specific item in the campaign that you're very drawn to, and it'll give you like huge benefits made specifically for you.
Dungeon Master 00:22:32 So, and it's not, it doesn't take an attunement slot to get the benefits because it's through what I've called soul binding. So it's just like a part of you. It's the item. It's like an extension of you. Yeah, I saw something a long time ago that used that term, but it wasn't anything like that. And so I did soul binding with like very specific weapons in the first campaign I ran.
Kaladen Shash 00:22:44 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:44 Gotcha. Okay, cool. I think for Leo it's gonna be nine volt batteries.
Leopold Magnus 00:22:45 That's awesome. Is that a homebrew mechanic? Now that's sick.
Dungeon Master 00:23:00 But then I also read something called heirloom items that get better the longer you use them. So then I combined it. So you guys get an item that constantly evolves with you that complements you the best.
Leopold Magnus 00:23:15 What was, sorry, what were you gonna get over there? Oh, you were just, you were saying that my heirloom item should be something. Hey man, that Energizer bunny, he kept going and going, so.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:21 What? Oh, I don't, was my character saying something? I don't know if I was saying something. Oh, I was just saying it. I thought it was going to be like a nine volt battery. But I mean, it was. Yeah, I know. Anyway. Oh.
Leopold Magnus 00:23:51 Well, I suppose we better get our stories straight if Kaladin's gonna come into the Legion looking like this skeleton. Do you have a disguise self or any kind of alter self spell?
Kaladen Shash 00:23:59 I don't know how. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know how we could drastically explain a significant shift. No. I couldn't do that forever, but I can't do that forever. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:59 Yeah, that's a fair point. Perhaps, uh... I don't even know, what could we possibly say? Like... I don't know, I feel like I might have something like that.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:25 But a long-term solution, I think we need to come up with a lie and then make it something that's reasonable, like you got cursed or something.
Kaladen Shash 00:24:37 Why don't, yeah, why don't, well, why don't we just say that, yeah, why don't we just say some sort of, well, not a curse, why not a, why not some sort of exposure or poison that, right, because it's so inhospitable outside of the dome and we got close to the edge of this cave system or something. What's that?
Zariel Torgan 00:24:54 You know what you could say, you know, you know, we could, we could just say that we did find the mask and that we found the guy and, you know, took the mask and, uh, you know, while we were deep in the caves and that he, you know, fell in the river and that's why his body's not here anymore. But, you know, we figured, Hey, you know, we can keep the mask and then you put it on and it did that to you that way. It's like the closest thing to the truth without actually being like,
Zariel Torgan 00:25:23 a lie per se. Great wisdom. Oh, that was a saving throw. Hang on. Oh, too bad. Oh, okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:25:27 Yeah, I will yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:25:28 Yeah, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:25:29 Everyone give me, not a perception, give me just a general wisdom check. Waste. So you don't have to reroll it. Just the dice is what matters. Just change the amount of time. If it's a nat 20, it doesn't matter.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:53 That'd be a 24. Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:25:57 Um, so nobody else needs to make it cause Zarya will realize it. You guys could also, you, you mentioned very something very specific, which is why I did it. Um, the closest to the truth would likely be that maybe Taladin's curse, um, like transformed him a little bit. You guys hear stories all the time about instead of it being these uncontrolled monstrous mutations, people sort of like,
Kaladen Shash 00:26:17 Right, because.
Dungeon Master 00:26:24 manifest very specific characteristics of their curse which is what makes like very exceptional fighters. You've heard stories about people whose limbs were like changed material to like a metal because they were like defending things like things like that happen where the curse sort of like transforms it when they push themselves a little too far.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:28 Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:26:47 So you know that's something that happened, and you guys did just go in a pretty intense fight, so that would be the closest to the truth that you could say. That would probably be questioned a little bit, but you wouldn't be grilled for something like that.
Kaladen Shash 00:26:48 Yeah, there we go. That covers that really easily. I think then I don't even have to really mention the mask. I can just say that occurred in battle, because I don't want to have to forfeit the mask or get into some big scuff about it.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:03 Okay. Yeah. And then if, yeah. And then if, uh, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, no, no, I think, I think that's the right call. And then that way Leo and I can just say like, Oh, Hey, you know, ask him, you know, it looks like saying, you know, some sort of curse thing, but I really don't know how it works. And then it's not really, you know, a lie. Cause we're not charismatic.
Leopold Magnus 00:27:33 Well, that's a grand idea, but I do think, Kaladin, you should describe how it happens so that we know how to describe it.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:42 Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Who specifically? Cedric?
Dungeon Master 00:27:42 This is all happening as you guys are watching to cover that.
Kaladen Shash 00:27:45 Yeah. I would just say that I was pressed too far in battle as we defeated our foe. I leaned into the isotropic curse too much. Is it, Jonathan, as we fought off
Kaladen Shash 00:28:08 I think we would, I think, yeah, we would just say as we pursued Cedric with his, you know, his one follower, we can make it sound like several followers as to why we got pressed so hard. Jonathan, is it understood or monitored who has or doesn't already exhibit the curse within the dome? Did we talk about that?
Zariel Torgan 00:28:16 OK. OK, sweet. Yeah, I can dig it.
Dungeon Master 00:28:20 Somebody said Donovan? You know, like a disproportionate number of Legionnaire and more advanced soldiers have the Esoptic Curse just because it makes them a little more extraordinary. It's like, think of it like the equivalent of like an adventuring
Leopold Magnus 00:28:20 They were pouring in from the walls. They surrounded us.
Dungeon Master 00:28:50 uh organization where like people who can do things really well go there um and i but i think it is people all are aware of who does it who has it um like better curses than others like who are the more powerful people is monitored and you guys do know that all three of you were extended an invitation because your curse manifested when you showed your power
Kaladen Shash 00:28:54 Right, but is it known amongst leadership? Right, and we already were targeted. Right, we exhibited our stuff during our trials. So it's already known. So yeah, this is a great, easy sell.
Dungeon Master 00:29:20 It's known that you have the curse, but you guys haven't had any sort of mutations yet.
Kaladen Shash 00:29:27 Correct. Yes, I'll just say, as we battled Sedovic, it was almost too much, and I had reached too deep. Yes, see, it was close. I could not... It was...
Zariel Torgan 00:29:27 Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah Cedric was really kicking your ass like bad, like it wasn't even close.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:41 I was sure you were going to go down. No, he was standing on top of you with his heel ground into your forehead. I'm shocked you made it out.
Kaladen Shash 00:29:57 Alright, I think. It wasn't that bad. It wasn't that bad. Hey, like I said, not that bad, but yes, very close. OK, OK. OK.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:58 Yeah, he peed on you for a second. Yeah, I feel pretty good about it.
Dungeon Master 00:30:00 It's about this time that you guys make your way back to if you remember on this map the water at the bottom right corner is sort of like
Leopold Magnus 00:30:12 Well, Zaria, I think I've got my story straight.
Dungeon Master 00:30:26 There is like an opening of water that like you can wade through to get to the mouth of the cave. The mouth of the cave gets deeper. You had a boat there that you could probably find eventually if you had hitched it up. I don't know if you guys had planned on coming back, but then from there you could try to like navigate yourself through the cave systems if you'd like.
Kaladen Shash 00:30:47 Yes, let's do this. Just use the radio, get picked up.
Zariel Torgan 00:30:47 So above table, if we just now decide we're not going to go into that cave, then whatever super scary monster Jonathan planned all week for, we won't see it. So we could just turn around and go somewhere else. Yeah. I know.
Leopold Magnus 00:31:00 Oh, Jesus.
Dungeon Master 00:31:08 Oh, you poor child to think that I would let that go. Luckily, I thought ahead and I picked them off so they could do anything. He's God. Who knows, right?
Zariel Torgan 00:31:16 Yeah, I say let's get in there. Yeah, I was going to say, yeah, it's a tunneling purple worm that is climbing trees to get us. Yeah. I was going to say, it's just a dragon at that point.
Dungeon Master 00:31:38 Maybe it's a tunneling purple worm that has legs and wings, and it's just a tunneling purple dragon. Anyway, you guys realize pretty quickly as you make your way, you get your boat. I'm not going to make you roll for that. It's pretty simple. You get sort of into it a little bit, and you realize that you are the direction you want to go, fighting the current the entire way. You're going to make very slow progress. In theory, it's possible, but you also do know that
Dungeon Master 00:32:07 At some points, the water is being projected out and upward against gravity due to the force and the way it was pushing. It's going to be really difficult to go the way that you came out. Certain classes can. It'll be in the class description. I believe artificers can prepare different spells.
Leopold Magnus 00:32:21 Just because I don't understand, can you change your spells at a long rest? Oh, interesting.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:32 Yeah. So I figure.
Dungeon Master 00:32:39 But I don't remember. But if you go to the Artificer page, it'll tell you how you spellcraft and part of that describes how you prepare or don't prepare spells. Wizards use their book, and then you can prepare them at the start of each day.
Leopold Magnus 00:32:53 And I'm also a wizard, so I guess if they do it differently. Which would be after a long rest. Right. Yeah, I have five of six prepared. Does that mean I can prepare another one?
Kaladen Shash 00:33:03 Yeah. Yeah, but you also have to, yeah, as you level up, you can pick spells. You can't just switch things around like druids. You have to build the book. Correct. Yeah, you can load up another one. It's a little bit of work.
Dungeon Master 00:33:22 Maybe I'll prepare another one, yeah. Wizards are cool in that any time you get a scroll, you can use the scroll to inscribe it into your book at the cost of gold and materials and stuff.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:24 Yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:33:24 Oh, OK, I haven't been doing anything with this.
Kaladen Shash 00:33:34 You can get. So yeah, that's that's the really key there. So in the library, if you just start transcribing a bunch of simple stuff and ones and two. Into your book. And trips.
Leopold Magnus 00:33:53 Okay, it looks like there's a shape water cantrip, but it won't let me learn it for some reason. Oh, okay.
Dungeon Master 00:34:01 You might be maxed on cantrips, so cantrips you only get a certain number of and spells are the other parts. That's later, but also as you level up in just any level, it doesn't have to be level up in wizard or artificer, you can get a new cantrip eventually.
Kaladen Shash 00:34:03 You can. Correct and you I don't know when that becomes a thing. I think certain rules of magic. A greater ability, or it's just a wizard feet, but you get to change one cantrip. Each long rest if you want. Yep. Yep.
Leopold Magnus 00:34:32 I see. OK. All right. Well, don't let me distract you any longer. Thank you for the information.
Kaladen Shash 00:34:34 Yep.
Dungeon Master 00:34:40 Now, this is guys in your court. What do you guys want to do?
Zariel Torgan 00:34:44 So I figured I'd do a combination of a few things. I've got thorn whip. And so I assume I can, you know, kind of attach myself to the boat in a semi-structural way. And then just kind of thorn whip out to like a rock face to get us through the spots that are like really, really tough. And that's about a 30 foot reach. So I figure I'll just do that to get us through the really tough parts. And the rest of the time we can take turns like
Zariel Torgan 00:35:13 you know, rowing or. Yes, same here.
Kaladen Shash 00:35:14 I can use lightning lure in the same way, but I only have a 15 foot reach. So as long as I can keep whipping towards whatever object, I'll just sculpt the lightning out of the lightning lure and make it a whip. Over and over and over every six seconds. Action, action, action, action.
Leopold Magnus 00:35:30 What if, um... So you can cast cantrips, like, out of combat, like, all the time, right? Okay. So what if, uh, what if I casted Ray of Frost over the water and froze it up so that we could just walk along frozen ice rather than try and fight the current?
Dungeon Master 00:35:38 You could do that.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:55 Can you freeze moving water like that? Does that spell powerful enough to do that?
Kaladen Shash 00:35:57 OK. Well, what about certain, because we need a certain level of inches to carry our weight. That's it. We don't need to freeze everything.
Leopold Magnus 00:36:01 I don't know. I mean, I would certainly work at a certain temperature, but I'd leave it up to Jonathan about Ray Frost. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:36:13 It would have to be bigger than that. Because there are spells designed to do stuff like that. Like control water, shape water, things like that. There's tensors, floating discs. There's like all these other spells that allow you to traverse water with the knowledge that cantrips are not powerful spells. You can't win a war with a cantrip kind of deal. People really try to push them.
Leopold Magnus 00:36:38 Yeah, I just thought I'd check. So that's a no. OK. OK.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:39 It's good.
Dungeon Master 00:36:44 You could certainly try. In theory, you would freeze the water, but whether or not you could run on it, sort of walk on it, that'd be a lot of casting power you might take on like levels of exhaustion. Like there's, there's, you could explore it, but would it be the easiest thing? I'm not so sure.
Kaladen Shash 00:37:05 Can you choose different? No, that doesn't work. Never mind.
Zariel Torgan 00:37:20 Um... I've got Water Walk, but I'm not seeing where it says how many people I can target. Oh, up to 10 willing creatures. Is it too late? I didn't really change any spells, but I... Can I say that I would have taken that, knowing we were gonna have to...
Kaladen Shash 00:37:37 You know.
Dungeon Master 00:37:46 Yeah, you guys weren't even sure if you had taken a long rest. So feel free to change out your spells that would have come with it. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:37:57 Okay, yeah, I'll do water walk and then that lasts an hour. Could we give that a shot? All right, let's see. It is a...
Dungeon Master 00:38:19 We don't. It only takes cork.
Zariel Torgan 00:38:25 Let's see. Ritual cast. And all I need is a piece of cork. So I'll take 10 minutes. And I'm not sure why it's a ritual cast. Just has the R there. OK. So does that mean I don't have to use the spell slot if I take 10 minutes? Hot damn.
Dungeon Master 00:38:49 Yeah, that's what it means.
Kaladen Shash 00:38:51 Ritual cast is great.
Zariel Torgan 00:38:55 I am all right I'm gonna sit down and I'm gonna like start waving my hands through the air and pulling out a piece of cork and just kind of like carving it up into like little figurines. And then it's gonna be three of them because there's three of us. And then at the end I'll drop the cork on the water and then they'll float. And then at the end of 10 minutes we all have water walk for an hour.
Dungeon Master 00:39:20 Very nice. I love that. You guys start walking. It's a little odd at first, because it's like a little bit like it's a very slow treadmill where you can definitely keep ahead of it. But the water's flowing the other direction, so you're like walking on the opposite moving ground. But you guys make your way down the tunnel. Maybe light a torch. If you have a light something, you can sort of cast light out. But it's a very dark space.
Dungeon Master 00:39:49 you'll have to do this a couple times in that you guys do remember it took like a few hours of just like sort of slowly floating in this boat to like get out of it so to go the other way walking it probably be another couple hours
Dungeon Master 00:40:05 But no problem, the parts that you need to sort of submerge yourself to get underneath certain areas of ceiling and wall, and you can sort of fight your way through the little forceful areas, you can eventually make your way towards that large space that, you know, like over 100 feet above you, you had the opening to the cave system above.
Dungeon Master 00:40:29 But you guys had constructed the boat and then dropped down into the water. So you guys, currently, you've casted a couple times, no issue. That's a pretty good plan, so I'm not gonna punish it. You guys are kind of on it, but eventually you do get to this space where you haven't super explored the area, but you stand roughly below where you had fallen through.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:59 All right, unless somebody else has a better plan that's maybe less resource, uses less resources, I guess, I could always turn into a giant spider and just haul everybody up. Well, if you want to save the slot, I think, unless I had to talk to Jonathan about it, I could.
Kaladen Shash 00:41:16 I can cast spider climb, but I think only on myself. Yeah, you can drag us up, drag me up. Oh, there you go.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:29 Well, I could climb up and leave a thread of my web as a rope. And then I could just anchor myself up there. That way I'm not having to, because that's pretty, from what I remember, it's a pretty precarious rock face. Yeah, it's just super crazy at certain spots. Is that something that might work, Jonathan?
Kaladen Shash 00:41:44 It was a very, it was like a deep, it was just a well. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:41:44 Yeah, that would kind of work, wouldn't it? I have to find the map I had of that area. But yeah, you don't really need to do anything for that either. So you guys can sort of make your way
Dungeon Master 00:42:14 Over time, Zariel turns into a giant spider. Does that require concentration? So you can wild shape, hold your concentration on Water Walk, quickly make your way all the way up to the top, towards the hole, anchor down some web, and then like lower yourself to pick them up. Is that sort of the plan?
Zariel Torgan 00:42:21 The spider, no, it's just a wild shape. Yeah, yeah, just a way to get from the bottom to the top using some sort of anchor. If that works, then I'd like to just
Dungeon Master 00:42:51 It's very funny, did you turn into a spider last time too? I just went to one of the old maps and there's a big spider on it. I'm pretty sure that means this is where you guys had jumped in.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:55 Yeah, that's why we had the spider eating a spider. From 4. That's great.
Dungeon Master 00:43:21 Oh, it didn't load that map. That's OK. We'll do this one. Eventually, you guys come to the base of that tunnel system.
Kaladen Shash 00:43:35 Great. Yeah. Jonathan, I'm going to go ahead and just say that I've just been on and off all day, just putting the mask on and off just to see if something happens again. And I think I'll just say at this point, I'm just wearing the mask in the cave
Zariel Torgan 00:43:37 Damn. We're going to get back and it's going to be like a monster in the city. It's all a big mislead.
Dungeon Master 00:44:04 You sort of play with it really lightly just like seeing if anybody notices a little bit of time here and there but nothing happens. You kind of you have like the breath in a fresh air and you gain like the active effects and everything sort of sharpens and all your senses hone in feel a little sturdier and then but like no there's no like body tearing vision kind of deal.
Kaladen Shash 00:44:14 Okay. Yep.
Zariel Torgan 00:44:37 As we get back to the top and we're in the old cave system, can I just, like, be keeping an eye out and an ear out? I mean, we just had some of his followers and him that we killed. So, I mean, can I, I don't know, can I just keep, can I, like, roll something? Yeah. Mmm, that's a four for an 11.
Dungeon Master 00:44:59 Yeah, give me a perception check if that's what you're looking for. 11. You hear like the rushing water below, so you don't hear a ton. That's sort of distracting, but there's not like an obvious mob, if that makes sense. That's not a concern.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:25 Gotcha, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:45:25 Jonathan, can I take a close look at the walls of this cave system or the surroundings, maybe looking for any kind of animal marks, evidence of like large moving creatures? Ooh, natural 20, 28.
Dungeon Master 00:45:40 Yeah, go ahead and give me, you can do investigation or perception. Natural 20. Leopold, you had come in up here originally. Your original pathing was top left. You've done a little bit of exploring down, but Cedric had been this way over here. Yeah. Oh, I didn't bring you guys to it. That's funny.
Leopold Magnus 00:46:01 Is the new map up? Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:02 Yeah, do I need to reload? There we go.
Dungeon Master 00:46:11 Let me know when you're there. Cool. You had originally come through here, made your way through, looked around, and had fought Cedric in an area over there. That map was the one that wasn't loading, so you can't go back there just yet, unfortunately. But... Or maybe I can find it. Anyway, this is, um...
Dungeon Master 00:46:37 This is an area you haven't super explored. And then Leopold, you are sort of walking down this way. And you hear down like a tunnel path where you can see there's like a little bit of a thrum.
Dungeon Master 00:46:55 hard to explain. But like this was originally going to be like a just a very high perception check. If you guys had asked about you'd hear something like this. But you do hear like just a low thrumming hum, just somewhere way out there as you're like looking at this different, different biodiversity. And remember, this is so deep into the ground, you guys had basically like, gone through a cave system broken through that key, you kept descending
Dungeon Master 00:47:25 And you are in just the deepest caverns that maybe nobody's ever explored. Not totally sure. And you hear this very odd sound. There's an aspect of both, actually.
Leopold Magnus 00:47:37 Jonathan, to an automaton's ears, does it sound organic or more mechanical? Interesting. And that was over kind of down yonder.
Zariel Torgan 00:47:44 Good question. Oh, shit.
Dungeon Master 00:47:57 It's just sort of going down on the map. But you do know that the way out was top left.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:04 I'll kind of come back to the team and I'll say, well, gents, there's some strange behavior down that tunnel there. And I'll just point directly in the direction of it. And it was making quite the thrum. And I don't know if we want to find out why.
Zariel Torgan 00:48:25 Well, perhaps we just sneak down, take a peek and see if it's related to Cedric. Maybe that's where he was going.
Kaladen Shash 00:48:43 You want to explore down there? Yes. Stop squeaking.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:48 Well, I think if we take a look, it's best to do it together.
Zariel Torgan 00:48:54 Yeah. Oh, I'm still a spider. Yeah, I'm just sitting there. Okay. Yeah, I'm good. I'm still got says I got two hours in this. So it's a really gnarly spider.
Dungeon Master 00:49:08 is grotesque, is an abomination.
Leopold Magnus 00:49:15 Hey, Caledon, I can never understand a word he's saying. How about you? I turn to Zario and I say, yes, Zario, that sounds like quite the plan.
Kaladen Shash 00:49:19 No, he never makes sense. What's just the phrase? Different oil, same gears, no? Okay, let's go. Let's check this area out.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:23 It's.
Dungeon Master 00:49:44 Okay, you guys, you're making your way down the tunnel to the right. There's like a section of it's pretty dark so you like gets pretty tight as well so you sort of like throw a torch down and you see it opens back up. Spiders are pretty weird creatures, it's possible Zario could sort of squeeze himself through if you would like.
Dungeon Master 00:50:06 leopold with like his just like robotic stiff frame you might have to like dislocate your arm like you've done before just like something pretty minimal but you guys could all get through and once you do you pop into a new system this one's got
Dungeon Master 00:50:23 like seems like a humidity to the air there's a warmth that sort of hits your face and the thrum is much louder in this space just like a it's still very distant but it's just like just very constant
Zariel Torgan 00:50:43 Oh shit, I bet we're gonna run into the thing that powers the dome or something. I bet it's gonna be something crazy like that.
Leopold Magnus 00:50:53 Jonathan, can I cast detect magic to check this out, see if I can pick up anything? Concentration up to 10 minutes, range 30 feet.
Dungeon Master 00:51:02 Detect magic has a range, right? But it's up for a certain amount of time. OK, so you cast it. You get the obvious.
Dungeon Master 00:51:18 Magical items on each of your persons and you're starting at this point to glow pretty bright There's a lot of magic on your persons, but you also see just like faintly in the air you're getting just sort of like hints of magic that's sort of of the school of like Abjuration you've got one that's like a little bit of evocation transmutation and
Dungeon Master 00:51:43 There's a bunch of different schools all sort of floating in the air, and it seems to sort of resonate forward, past your 30-foot range. It keeps going.
Leopold Magnus 00:51:57 There's something interesting here. Strong magic is afoot. Oh, my God. Oh, the abdomen.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:58 Interesting. Hmm. Interesting. I uploaded a picture of what my spider form looks like in the chat. You guys take. I, uh.
Dungeon Master 00:52:13 We got rid of that fucking hat. Ew, it's even worse than I thought. Why does it have a six pack?
Leopold Magnus 00:52:26 Do you wear aviators? Is that what you wear when you're in your spider form? That makes me feel uncomfortable.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:32 Yeah, I typed in gigantic spider with greasy six-pack abs and aviator shades on all its eyes. And so that was extremely accurate. Much better than I was expecting. I'm just there, just skirting along. Yeah, yeah, I bring that stool with me.
Kaladen Shash 00:52:39 Wow, all right. It did what you asked. High five.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:56 And you walk upright like that, huh? Oh, my God. All right. I'm into it. The mental image is there.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:01 I do a stand up, I do a tight five minutes. Are we heading in?
Dungeon Master 00:53:06 Let's take five minutes. You feel me?
Leopold Magnus 00:53:22 Yeah, I'll head in, but we proceed with some caution. Seems like it would be prudent.
Dungeon Master 00:53:35 Awesome. Hopefully moving. Nothing right. The only light you're getting at this moment is any light you're presenting yourself or your dark vision, things like that. But you do notice that it's deeper into the tunnel. There seems to be a little bit of ambient light of some kind. But you're so far away at this point that you can't tell what it is, especially standing at the mouth of this area.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:35 I can't talk, so I'll just nod.
Kaladen Shash 00:53:40 Jonathan, are there any light sources down here? Yeah, can we move forward cautiously?
Zariel Torgan 00:54:08 Yeah, I'll take the lead since I'm in my wild shape and I've got some hit points to burn in case there's something bad that happens. Should we roll stealth? We're stealthing, right? It is, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:54:16 Okay. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:54:20 Oh yeah, stealthing. This music is pretty sick, by the way. All right, I'll go for some stealth here. And I have disadvantage. Eight for my stealth check.
Dungeon Master 00:54:24 Real stealth. You guys can move your things, right? I think it was locked for no reason. Well, thanks. I've got some music for the next sort of mission that you guys are going to be put on if you choose to. We'll play that. Clang, clang, clang, clang.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:47 Ouch. Oh. Oh, awesome.
Leopold Magnus 00:54:51 Yeah, I'm wearing a big suit of armor, so I'm not very sneaky.
Dungeon Master 00:54:54 Ooh, Jesse, sidebar. The new season of Legend of Mox Machina is out. So see campaign, uh, campaign one, season three is out and they're doing the whole Thordak stuff.
Kaladen Shash 00:55:01 All of the whole season. It's pretty. It's pretty cool, John. I was gonna ask Jonathan how. How close is all of season three to what happened in the show? I've. OK.
Dungeon Master 00:55:17 They've changed some things. I don't know what you've seen, but people don't really die in that quick of succession. And when they do die in the show, it was like they were brought back a little bit more.
Dungeon Master 00:55:32 quickly and efficiently for the pace of the stream. But it was a lot less dramatic because they had the ability to just keep bringing people back. So the show did it way better, but everything with Ripley and Orthax coming back was true. The way that she had the
Kaladen Shash 00:55:32 Quickly. Yeah. Right. Yep. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:55:52 Items is incorrect. They changed some things to make her a bigger bad guy than she was at that point. She did come back with a pretty big role, but it wasn't the way they did it. But other than that, a lot of it's really close in the hells when they go to hell, Jesse, they go to hell. None of that kind of happened. That's all way different.
Kaladen Shash 00:56:03 Yeah. OK, OK. Right.
Zariel Torgan 00:56:09 Oh, sweet. They probably just took that from that.
Dungeon Master 00:56:16 So they do, but that character, um, he's the paladin from calamity. So Xerxes is like a character from the show that they put in that wasn't actually there originally because calamity came so many years later, but they gave him a role. Uh, they made it a little bit more Pike heavy for that. Um, and that boss they fought,
Dungeon Master 00:56:42 that goes into the Vorugal fight, which was so epic, that was something they summoned. That wasn't something that came from hell, necessarily. So a bunch of things were a little bit different, but I think they did a lot of things better, even, that they had time to, like, edit it and make it TV instead of just in the moment. I think they did a divine intervention. There was no punch from this guy, but the fight with, like,
Kaladen Shash 00:56:45 Yeah. OK. Yeah. No, it was really cool. I loved it.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:01 Yeah. As a... Sweet. Also, if anybody hasn't watched Calamity, you should absolutely watch it. It's fantastic. Yeah, that's awesome.
Dungeon Master 00:57:10 The Balgura and Vorugal was fucking sick. Okay, back to the campaign. Oh, Xerxes is in it. He's in the house. They brought him back as a character. He's... But again, it did eliminate everything else. Still had the Plate of the Dawnmonter in it, though.
Kaladen Shash 00:57:16 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:36 Okay, nice.
Dungeon Master 00:57:37 Oh, and then, Brenna, are you caught up on campaign three right now? No. I don't want to spoil it, but just I want to create excitement. Not only are they playing Bells Hells and they're playing their characters from the Mighty Nein, they're playing their Vox Machina characters. They jumped into their roles as like,
Kaladen Shash 00:57:42 I am still one and a half episodes behind. I'm just chasing. I'm on one 11. So I guess I'm only, I'm on, I think I'm on the final episode right now. That's yes. Oh my gosh.
Dungeon Master 00:58:06 Vex, and Grog, and Pike, and Scanlan's back, and like, so cool. They go even further, all three campaigns are in it now.
Kaladen Shash 00:58:13 That's gonna say that's how 110 ended. They're all just like staring at each other. That's really funny. They're back and forth conversations so. Yeah. It's gonna be cool. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:58:26 I can't wait. Again, back to the campaign, though. I got excited. You guys should be able to move your characters. Let me know where you're moving. If you want to make certain checks at any place, don't let me just force you along. Sweet. You keep moving. Love that.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:31 Oh. I'll just be out in front, so I'll go another 30.
Kaladen Shash 00:58:42 I just moved 30 feet because I thought we were going to roll and move and roll and move. Spidering on the wall.
Leopold Magnus 00:58:46 Yeah. 30 feet. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:58:57 Azariel, as you walk into this, oh yeah, you're a spider. I don't have that one on this one, but spider form. You come into this room. There's like a thin, shallow layer of water at the base. It sinks down a little bit. To the left, you see, there's two different tunnels, left and up. To the left, you see just beyond your vision, like your clear vision, a bright orange glow emanating from like the next room. The room above you,
Dungeon Master 00:59:27 has only darkness, no sort of special light that way. 60 feet. Yeah, actually, that's quite a bit on this map. You get vision all the way to here, and then you do see there is like pools of lava in the next room.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:32 I've got 60 feet of dark vision. Is there anything more I can see from this position?
Dungeon Master 00:59:55 If you look up, you see just it bends around the corner. Still no glow. Yes, as your sword, if you still have your Detect Magic up, there is a faint trace of magic up and a very strong trace of magic moving left.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:04 OK. I'm going to take one of my
Leopold Magnus 01:00:06 Jonathan, is the magic feeling any stronger now that we're progressing down the tunnel?
Zariel Torgan 01:00:32 little feet, and I'm going to point towards the lava. And then I'm going to reach down into the water, and I'm going to act like the water is really hot, like it's burning me. And then I'm going to point forward, and I'm just going to kind of shrug like a spider. But I guess you guys could just walk up and see.
Kaladen Shash 01:00:50 Yeah. And then Jonathan, very quick question. How close does everybody need to be to me to be able to use the interwoven roots?
Leopold Magnus 01:00:53 I'm kind of standing here, hands on my hip, just watching him do his little dance.
Dungeon Master 01:01:04 You touch them, so it's something that you like, you put your hand on them, you embed this sort of network, and then they grow, like from the description, a little flower from up top their ear that signifies it took place, but it's a touch. It's just magic, you just touch them.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:22 Yep. Perfect. OK. Does it just have verbal components or is it just touch? I think I would just walk up to. Yeah, I'll walk up to. Yep, I'll walk up between both of them and just tap both their shoulders and one of your. Your super gross legs.
Zariel Torgan 01:01:35 I was just like, Oh, sorry. I was just recognizing this from something else, but you go ahead. Sorry.
Dungeon Master 01:01:51 Can you sprout, what kind of flower do they sprout? Jumped on, basic question.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:55 That's a good question. Let's have them be just begonias. Easy, easy flower. Let's do begonias. Something really simple.
Dungeon Master 01:02:17 Last little begonia sprouts upon whatever ear you wish it to be in your head as his like fey magic takes root in your body. And for, I believe at this point, the next two to three hours, you have a telepathic bond to each other where you can speak telepathically within 60 feet of each other. Flower.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:32 Four hours. OK. A little flower just grows by your ear. This flower allows us to now telepathically communicate through my interwoven roots ability when wearing the mask.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:42 So we just have like a little bling, like a little earring. Interesting.
Dungeon Master 01:02:54 When he wills it off, the flower wilts, dies, and falls off. So it's very much alive. Yes.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:03 Interesting. So is this like a rapport sports kind of thing? OK, sweet. Is this a is this like a telepathic thing or is it a straight verbal ear thing?
Kaladen Shash 01:03:05 I would just. I'll just kind of continue to walk and not look back over my shoulder and say. Let us move forward more efficiently. Which direction shall we go? Yep, totally, totally, totally in the head. Totally in the head.
Dungeon Master 01:03:30 You can talk in your spider form and also you guys can talk without being sort of listened to through your armor.
Leopold Magnus 01:03:31 Yeah, now you can talk to us.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:35 Okay, awesome. Nice. Yeah, I'll just say, I think probably left makes the most sense.
Kaladen Shash 01:03:57 Let us check it out.
Leopold Magnus 01:03:59 Indeed, I'm curious if this sense of magic are all through the air.
Dungeon Master 01:04:09 Zario with your detect magic, not Zario, Leopold. The magic to the left feels, again, very much like a blend of all these general schools of magic. The magic that's above you is divination. It is not the same school of magic. Gross. Why does he have beer now?
Leopold Magnus 01:04:28 Interesting. Okay. Oh my God. Dude, that's just, that's just bad Photoshop.
Kaladen Shash 01:04:35 That one's getting weird. That one's getting real weird.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:43 It's just not good. I only added that last one because it was just so wild. Anyway, let's continue.
Dungeon Master 01:04:43 You're getting real close to showing spider dick with that. It's just showing more and more of his lower abdomen.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:06 Interesting. So can I just do a quick peek up around this tunnel and maybe make an investigation for, I don't know, any kind of hidden or obscured spell or potentially something like that?
Dungeon Master 01:05:22 Yeah, you make your way around the corner. You sort of like eventually get up to the bend. You look around the corner. It's a dark space, so you're sort of relying on any light you can provide. But give me an investigation check, because you've sort of hung right around this area. 30, 20. You see on the wall a simple
Kaladen Shash 01:05:38 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:41 Let's see how it goes. Not bad, 20, 30, 20.
Zariel Torgan 01:05:46 Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:05:52 arcane glyph sort of drawing where the lines are thin they give a little bit of like a magic hue but on the wall inscribed is a crude picture of what appears to be three corvid type birds and a simple text script in what languages do you speak?
Leopold Magnus 01:06:16 Uh, the languages Leopold speaks, uh, abyssal, common, and Solmenic. Okay. Um, there's something you might want to take a look at over here. And I'll point it out. Uh, is it readily seen or it's hidden?
Zariel Torgan 01:06:16 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:06:24 That's probably the robot one. It's not any of those languages. It's on the wall, but it looks like it hasn't been there very long compared to everything else in this cave.
Kaladen Shash 01:06:31 What do you see? I'm just saying this in his head.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:53 Okay, so it... Right. Yeah, that's what I was hoping, like, I guess if it was plainly seen, right? It's not like something I would have missed, right? Right.
Dungeon Master 01:06:53 And divination, you would know, is like scrying magic, some protection magic, messaging magic, things like that. So this was placed here at some point. Yeah, you can see it. It's not like you could only see it from a super high magic check. It's there.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:17 Bill.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:18 Okay, so yeah, I was wondering if that investigation check could lead me more towards what this spell or glyph is doing.
Dungeon Master 01:07:27 No, but your detect magic would help out with this, but I don't think it's not super necessary. This doesn't seem like more complicated. It does seem like it's just something that was like.
Dungeon Master 01:07:37 put into the wall like a message for somebody for you, you don't know for something else, you know, Cedric was sort of heading down this way, it could have been for him. But what catches you immediately is it's very similar to you had seen something like this in a different area when you were earlier on in your adventuring that had a picture of one sort of bird, it was a crow. And it said one for sorrow in common. This has three birds, but you can't read it.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:59 Yeah. Thunder features and traits.
Kaladen Shash 01:08:09 Jonathan, would I understand this language? Where do I see the languages we can speak? I'm on the main page.
Dungeon Master 01:08:12 You would. It's in like your features or something. Info and something else. There's a different page for it. If you're on your phone, if you're on the main page, I think it's just like at the bottom. This is Sylvan and it says three for a wedding.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:31 Yes, on the left. Proficiencies in training. On the.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:44 Hmm. Interesting.
Kaladen Shash 01:08:45 You guys, you guys, it translates to three for the wedding. Does anything else look familiar about the symbols or does it like mean something when I see it or is it?
Dungeon Master 01:08:45 And that's it. Just that it's very similar to what you saw very early on. I forget, it was like below, it was in the fungal cave on your way to the Lancex, the fungal guardian.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:07 Yeah, I looked it up. Yep.
Kaladen Shash 01:09:15 Can I do an investigation against the wall? Is this a false wall? Do I feel any? I'm not going to see it. I'm not going to see it. Take a minute. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:09:15 Is there... Yeah, sorry. Is there something I can do, I'm not sure what kind of check it would be, to just take into account both
Dungeon Master 01:09:22 You could, but no matter what your check was, no matter how high, it's just a standard wall. There's nothing you're missing here. This is just very oddly placed.
Zariel Torgan 01:09:45 bird images that we saw with the wording specifically and make like, I don't like a religion or insight or what kind of is there a check I can make to see if I have any sort of previous knowledge like is it from a fable or something like that that I might know?
Dungeon Master 01:10:02 You tell me what kind of check you want to make. Like, what are you looking for? And I'll tell you what check sort of correlates to that, but it's, um, like out above table, there's nothing you've had in game. That's like a hint to this. There's not, you have, this hasn't been really explained that you're missing. This is something you haven't figured out yet. So if you make a check, you can sort of make ground on it, but you don't know what this is.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:31 Okay, all right, I guess it'd just be like religion. So just to see if, okay. That's gonna be a natural one. It's from the great bird religion.
Dungeon Master 01:10:35 Yeah. This one is three. The other one says one. That's about all you can kind of put together on that one. I think you.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:40 The crow? I was looking it up. You previously identified the bird as an albatross, which I believe may have been a misidentification. Or is that true, John? Yeah, so you really think these are albatrosses now?
Kaladen Shash 01:10:43 He knows nothing. He knows true.
Dungeon Master 01:11:04 before check on it and you thought it was an albatross. In a special form.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:10 Mmm. Three albatrosses. What could it possibly mean? I'll take fervent notes. As a spider.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:22 I'll just kind of point up to the birds and I'll say, oh gee, it looks like we've got three for a funeral there.
Kaladen Shash 01:11:31 That's not right. Okay, let us continue to the other magic.
Dungeon Master 01:11:38 And that's how you guys see it from the corner. You guys make your way down. Just review a little large part of it at once. Huge space ends the cavern sort of here. You do notice with looking in that it goes down.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:42 Yeah, I want to... I just want to be out in front in case there's some sort of AOE thing.
Kaladen Shash 01:12:03 well lit with this glowing. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:12:06 Yes, there's a large, slow magma flow, and I think it really just reinforces how deep into the Earth you guys have made it.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:20 Hmm. OK. Is there an easy way to get up onto the ceiling? Can I just take where I am on the map, but just put me on the ceiling? All right, I'd like to make my way up.
Dungeon Master 01:12:38 Yeah, if you're a spider, pretty easy. Yep.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:51 this direction here and see if I see anything up. I guess it'd be here. See what's going on up this little area. And that thrumming, has it
Dungeon Master 01:13:00 This, you see, goes to this sort of outlet back here. You can kind of see around the corner. It doesn't seem to be as if there's anything obvious in that space. You're welcome to make a check, but as far as you can tell, it's just a dead end.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:22 Has it lended itself towards a specific direction more now that we're getting closer? I'll just say there's nothing up here and I'll head back down this way.
Dungeon Master 01:13:27 As you're getting closer and closer, and with the aid of Leopold's Detect Magic as he's sort of skirting the lava, it's a little more present at the bottom than at the top. We're talking like the barest of differentiations here, because it's very ambient.
Dungeon Master 01:13:57 This opens up into this. You make your way down. And there you go. Thanks, just found it online. Eventually, you make your way down. Spider Climb makes it all very easy. This leads down to a different portion, a different map. Yes, it would be otherwise pitch black, but this is...
Zariel Torgan 01:14:04 This is quite the map. Is the only light that we're getting from the lava?
Leopold Magnus 01:14:09 All right.
Kaladen Shash 01:14:28 And as we've walked this distance, John, I just kind of keep staring at the walls. Do I see any other engravings like we saw in that one dead end? Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:14:40 No. You do notice, as you're paying a lot of attention to the walls, the way you're going seems to be like you're following the thrum and the hum and the arcane pull. You are noticing a little more moisture, sort of.
Dungeon Master 01:15:00 like condensing onto the walls as you kind of come in. It's like consolidating, dripping down at certain points. So you think it may be a little more water this way, but you're also noticing what look like some of them very old, like very, very old, but some of it looks a little bit fresh, like what seemed to be like claw marks and some scorch marks, just like scattered as you're making your way through this huge system.
Dungeon Master 01:15:28 And as you come into like this, it's like a very narrow tunnel. You see a lot more as if something had like pulled itself through at some point. But again, they look very old. Wet and hot and humid. Yeah, it's getting a little more steam.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:38 So Jonathan, you said this is getting fairly wet. So is this whole cave just full of steam? Yeah. Right, with the lava.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:39 Does the water appear to have a source as I'm as I'm climbing across the ceiling? Is it like dripping from the ceiling? Or is it just like, present like humidity?
Dungeon Master 01:15:59 Coming out of a micro crack here and there. Nothing new source you found yet.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:09 Well, I mean, I'll keep trucking, I guess.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:14 So you said there was some scratch marks that maybe seemed like they were more recent.
Dungeon Master 01:16:22 Yeah, at certain parts of the tunnel there were some like, looked to be a little more recent ones. There doesn't seem to be an obvious pattern to them, not a unilateral direction to them, but some are new, some are old, not sure what to make of that.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:39 Can I do a nature check on some of the newer ones, looking specifically for evidence of a fight? Like maybe there's a directionality to the scratch, or maybe they're not quite as slow and long as other tracks, that type of thing. I guess I'll do an investigation if that's higher. Another natural 20.
Dungeon Master 01:16:56 Give me an investigation, perception, nature, whatever you'd like. Natural 20. Good rolls. You notice that not only does there actually appear to be directionality to these claw marks, these are
Zariel Torgan 01:17:07 Goddamn. Said it was wet.
Dungeon Master 01:17:22 of a hard material. It looks like the dirt was... Stop doing that, dude. Come on. I'm just... I'm just going to have like an anti-magic field, but it just dispels it for no reason. The clown marks seem to be heading in the direction you're heading, but it doesn't look like a fight. This doesn't look like acts of aggression. This looks like, at some points, like assisted movement, finding purchase.
Zariel Torgan 01:17:37 Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:17:51 like holding up weight of some sort of and yeah you figure it out once you hit like the narrowing of a tunnel you can see very obviously like four separate placements of marks signifying four limbs it appears.
Leopold Magnus 01:17:56 It's transiting through, essentially. Dense.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:13 So this looks pretty obviously like burrowing, right?
Kaladen Shash 01:18:14 Is it?
Leopold Magnus 01:18:18 Gents, um, suppose you remember those fellas that were getting dragged off from the club into old Selena's potion shop. What do you suppose these quadrupedal marks here on the cave walls are from? Oh, bigger. Okay. They're not, they're not like related. Cause I don't know if we ever actually saw the thing that dragged those guys.
Dungeon Master 01:18:34 Within that 20, nothing like that. These are way bigger. Way bigger. Those little things that were dragging the people off were like little mushroom dog creatures. You fought them. They're like up to your knee. The one you are
Kaladen Shash 01:18:48 Yes. Yeah. I'll be big.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:48 Okay. Got it. Got it. Got it. Okay. So this isn't like related.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:50 Yeah. So do we get the impression from the spacing of these marks that whatever made these marks also made the cave we're walking through?
Dungeon Master 01:19:03 moving into, it seems much more likely. The space you were in before seemed natural. And I'll say even within that 20, that's a very high role. You did some backtracking and Leopold notices that the area that you didn't fully check out, they seem to have like originated from there, like everything starts there and sort of moves down to where you are heading.
Zariel Torgan 01:19:28 Interesting. I bet it's still burrowing. I bet that's what we're hearing. Yeah, should we restealth or can we? I'm not sure how long it's been since we stealthed before.
Leopold Magnus 01:19:38 There's a large creature in this tunnel system, and I think we better be careful. You guys want to cast anything for it, or should we just go in with...
Dungeon Master 01:19:52 Go for it. 85. No, yeah, it's above.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:01 I'm a spider. I can't cast. Better. It's not a terrible average. It's like a 14.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:08 Bye.
Kaladen Shash 01:20:20 We need Hamart to create something to make your armor more quiet. This is crazy. Don't have to speak out loud. You can speak in your mind. My God. I'm saying that in his head.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:30 I think I spin around and it's a tambourine kind of jingles in my chest cavity. Well, it's probably best that all of this gold goes into a sack of some kind. Oh. Oh, dear.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:31 Yeah, he just... It's just echoing through the cave.
Dungeon Master 01:20:31 You guys keep moving slowly.
Kaladen Shash 01:20:53 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:20:58 fairly stealthily through this narrow, not narrow, you guys can walk in it, but it's smaller than the space you came from. And then partway through, there is like a sort of like a break in the wall and you see a large flow of water sort of spurting out, collecting on the ground and it forms like a little narrow waterbed at your feet that sort of follows this direction. And the Thrum is much more present in this narrow space.
Dungeon Master 01:21:26 present enough that you can tell, contrary to what Zariel had maybe proposed earlier, it doesn't sound like a burrow. It is like a radiating sound, like a hum of a speaker that's not playing music, just like a low-level... just like... But eventually you're moving through as quietly as you can, and you make it to a much more open space.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:45 Hmm. Shit. Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 01:21:45 Very interesting.
Dungeon Master 01:21:56 steam rising from the grounds and you see at the very back as you're sort of like peeking around the corner, it appears the water disappears into a space at the bottom there. Perception check.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:14 And just looking around this space, do we see anything as it kind of opens up that would lend towards what we're hearing or anything just off? 17?
Dungeon Master 01:22:32 13. Any other ones?
Kaladen Shash 01:22:34 Let me roll, hold on. Perception? No better, not at all.
Leopold Magnus 01:22:36 I was wondering if I could use my detect magic and maybe specifically an arcana check to suss out a little bit more if it's possible.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:48 at the scaling in this map. Oh, this is a huge map.
Dungeon Master 01:22:58 Uh, yeah, your detect magic is, it's lending all pretty much the same stuff at this point. You're not getting new information. Um, but it does seem to be down towards the bottom seems to be the focus of magic. Uh, and you have what seems to be some sort of exit tunnel to the top though. And
Dungeon Master 01:23:27 For some reason, like your magic, because that 23 is pretty high, it seems like something else up there, but it's not the same magic. It doesn't have the same sort of presence and full ambience. It's just like you're picking up something distantly way up there. But again, detect magic only goes 30 feet. This is, I'm giving you a little bit extra with the high rule.
Leopold Magnus 01:23:49 Okay. Yeah, I'll point out to the team that there's two sources of magic that are distinctly different. This tunnel over here to the north, I think, contains a different beast. Might be best to isolate it. Maybe we should lay some traps before we investigate further.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:05 Well. Do we have any traps?
Dungeon Master 01:24:21 So you hear shifting of movement, something moves to your right in the cave somewhere with your perception check. Like Zariel's looking down towards the bottom corner of the map, it's like down and right of his view.
Kaladen Shash 01:24:23 What?
Leopold Magnus 01:24:35 I like up here. Yeah. Down here.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:35 to the right of stage right or my right on the map? I'll make mention of that. I'm going to see if I can.
Dungeon Master 01:24:53 Somewhere from here to here. Not sure. It's just in that space. You can tell it's not from the left. Ceilings light.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:03 I'll take my movement and my action. I want to get up on the ceiling to maybe about here, if I can get that, oh, hang on, sorry. Like, maybe here, if I can get that far on the ceiling. How tall are we looking at in this room? Or this space? Good, okay. Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:25:21 80, 90 feet tall. As you get to the very top of it, if you do climb up, it becomes very difficult for you to move without falling because all the steam sort of rises up and collects and there's like a little bit of like a steam cloud bank at the top of the cage system. Yeah, I saw that.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:42 Gotcha. Well, I'm a very wet spider, so I'm pretty used to it. I don't want to climb up if I'm that far. I don't want to be out of range to do stuff. I guess, can I just make my way around this ledge so I can see further down and see if I can spot whatever it is? If I want to move to right, right about here.
Dungeon Master 01:26:02 Which ledger? As you're moving forward, you hear burbling from like the different pits of magma. And as you're moving forward this way, you can't help but feeling that the sound is constantly on your right. So as you hit this point, there's something somewhere over here.
Dungeon Master 01:26:30 to hear, but you're not seeing anything, not from your perspective. Give me an athletic check or if you have a spider way of doing it instead.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:40 Hmm. Can I just pick up a big rock and throw it into that magma pool right there? Oh, yeah, I guess I'm a spider. Maybe I'll just ask the group and say, I get the sense something's coming from this area over here, and I point one of my spider legs.
Leopold Magnus 01:26:52 Hold on, before you're doing that. Yes, sorry, I'm laying a trap. Just give me a few seconds.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:10 Any ideas before I throw a rock in there? Roger.
Leopold Magnus 01:27:23 So, Jonathan, is this area here, is it pretty large, this entrance? Is it 10 feet, I guess, up here to this tunnel exit? It's like maybe 10 feet wide? Yeah. I'm going to lay a snare, which has a five-foot radius right in the center of the tunnel.
Dungeon Master 01:27:31 Where? Yeah, it's like 10 feet. OK.
Leopold Magnus 01:27:52 So basically, anything that isn't paying attention will step right over the top of it. And then I'm going to join back up with the group and I'll message to Zario. All through, go ahead with whatever you have planned.
Dungeon Master 01:28:04 Easy enough. No check required. That's a pretty simple task.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:08 Yeah, I guess I'll, I've got a ranged web attack. I'll just shoot out a ball of
Zariel Torgan 01:28:36 spider web, I guess, and have it land on the top of the goop and see if I can notice any change or anything. Natural 20. No.
Dungeon Master 01:28:45 Go ahead and roll a ranged attack. Natural 20. Is there damage associated with this? Is there?
Kaladen Shash 01:28:59 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 01:29:06 but it is restrained if it hits a creature. There's no save.
Dungeon Master 01:29:16 No save. Size specifications, what's the wording?
Zariel Torgan 01:29:20 It just says, so I'll read it verbatim. It says, ranged weapon attack. On a hit, the target is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 12 strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed.
Dungeon Master 01:29:44 Does it say anything about the webbing being flammable? Okay, here's what I'll say, because I really love that this is exactly how this played out. As the spider, you sort of rear up
Zariel Torgan 01:29:49 It does say that here on the bottom, the weapon can also be attacked and destroyed, AC 10, hit points 5, vulnerable to fire damage, immunity to bludgeoning.
Kaladen Shash 01:29:49 Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:30:09 So you're like, the legs are like up like a spider does when it's getting ready to bite and your sort of big abdomen is right below you and it shoots up away a web. Again, this is a pretty tall little ledge right here. It's not like visible. It's like up over the top of the ledge. You shoot it and you see it sort of like just over the top, arc down and disappear. Instead of just hearing it sizzle right away, you hear it make purchase on something just like a dull
Dungeon Master 01:30:39 like squishy thud as it hits something. And then you see the distinct light that you see when something catches fire for the first time. There's like an explosion of like brighter orange light that sort of levels out as the light disperses. And you can tell at that moment that the webbing has caught fire as it is like hit lava. But what you reveal in hitting this thing that was sort of perched up there,
Zariel Torgan 01:31:09 Oh, shit.
Dungeon Master 01:31:10 A large red serpent, crimson scales gleaming like molten metal streaked with black and dark red like smoldering embers. Golden eyes flare with cruel intelligence as you see it sort of steps forward, having heard you approaching, but also not stealthy enough to avoid your guys' ears, you see this
Dungeon Master 01:31:39 young red dragon stares defiantly down at you, bits of webbing burning off of one of its horns at the top. It opens its mouth and sort of chitters a bit in a deep grumble as you see a flame burns deep in its throat and its piercing ivory white fangs get ignited from back and you can see just how bright they are.
Zariel Torgan 01:31:50 hehehehehehehehehehe
Dungeon Master 01:32:07 Everybody roll me initiative. Yeah, you were pretty quiet during that. You can have done a couple things. And if not, you could have been at some point. Go for it.
Kaladen Shash 01:32:12 Could I have done anything before that? I think we're all within 30 feet right now, maybe. 30 feet, yeah. I would have wanted to cast Bless before the initiative, just knowing that this felt imminent.
Zariel Torgan 01:32:35 Hmm. Ah, music change.
Kaladen Shash 01:32:52 Remember, everybody can add its attack and saving throws, right? Just those two. Draw them. OK. Wow. That's unbelievable. I thought I was going to be so much higher than everybody and not.
Dungeon Master 01:32:59 Mhm.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:14 I got a seven. I mean a six.
Kaladen Shash 01:33:23 Look at that. Beastie got nothing.
Dungeon Master 01:33:28 I wiped it so I have to put you guys back in. Awesome. Also rolled pretty low. The dragon's low Chittering Growl turns into a roar as it unleashes a
Leopold Magnus 01:33:36 Yeah, seven for me.
Dungeon Master 01:33:49 fiery breath weapon as you guys see exploding from its mouth almost looks at first just like a fluid spewing out and then as the fluid sprays it ignites and catches fire and then that will be a 30-foot cone which honestly might not hit as many people as he would like it might just be the spider
Zariel Torgan 01:34:16 It's all right, that's what I wanted. I think 11 is going to be good enough to pass, right? I mean, it's a, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:34:18 Now he can hit both of you. Leopold and Zariel in spider form, give me a dexterity saving throw. Probably.
Leopold Magnus 01:34:38 I have a question. Uh, so is this an, uh, elemental or, uh, something similar to that? Right. But his, his weapon, is this an elemental weapon of some kind? Okay. I guess I just have to spell absorb elements. I'm wondering if it's applicable here.
Dungeon Master 01:34:48 This is a young red dragon. Breath weapon is just fire. Just exhale. Exhale is fire. Absorb elements is just on yourself, correct?
Leopold Magnus 01:35:12 Yeah, it says acid, cold, fire, lightning, damage, et cetera. Yeah, OK. So this is fire damage? Oh, OK. I thought you said I did. Maybe I confused. Sorry.
Kaladen Shash 01:35:12 Yes. Yeah, what are we making a? So here it comes.
Dungeon Master 01:35:18 You are not targeted in the attack, you're too far away. No, just Zariel and Kaladin are in it. They would cooperate. Deck safe, yeah. Zariel failed.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:38 a deck save. What? 11 wasn't good enough? It's not an adult though, it's a young dragon. Oh! Ouch. Oh, hell yeah!
Kaladen Shash 01:35:47 When Dyson's coming. 14 is not great either. So we added added before added before gentlemen added before. 16
Dungeon Master 01:35:53 Oh Tooth fails Sorry guys
Zariel Torgan 01:36:11 Take that. Fifteen. Fifteen. Fifteen. Oh, oh. Holy Jesus.
Dungeon Master 01:36:22 Uh, you say 16 and 16? Uh, still both fail. You guys take 56 points of fire damage.
Kaladen Shash 01:36:24 16 and what was yours? Yeah. Oh my goodness. We're getting yeah, we're getting roasted here. I'm on the ground.
Zariel Torgan 01:36:48 I think you misspoke. Hang on. So that's 30 off of mine. Gotcha. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:36:53 Add. Correct count. OK, cool cool cool.
Dungeon Master 01:36:54 Each creature in that area must take a DC 17 dexterity saving throw, taking 16 D6 fire damage on a successful save and half as much on a failed and half as much on a successful save.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:12 Alright, I lost my spider form, you burned up all of the abs that I had, and now it's just me, toasted, with about 20 HP.
Dungeon Master 01:37:32 Up next, Kaladin. Give me a death saving throw. Natural 20.
Kaladen Shash 01:37:37 Yep. Giddy up. That's fantastic.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:46 Oh, hell yeah. Goddamn.
Dungeon Master 01:37:55 Not only do you pop up at the start of your turn with 1 HP, but you have full action, bonus action, movement, everything. Pulls out a gun. You have your full turn, man. Congrats on your nat 20.
Kaladen Shash 01:38:09 Strong bounce back. But. It was a sweet way to come right back up. I guess I was having a hard time getting my house so back to one. I'm
Zariel Torgan 01:38:14 It's like a call the ambulance, but not for me. It's a dragon. That was awesome.
Dungeon Master 01:38:24 The best place. It's so difficult.
Kaladen Shash 01:38:37 I'm going to use my movement to distance myself. And... Did we have any... healing capabilities? Potions, etc.
Dungeon Master 01:39:02 You at this point are underneath the like the parameters of the dome so you have
Kaladen Shash 01:39:12 Would I recognize the suit was charged then? Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:39:14 Your suits are functional. You're getting the armor bonus from them. You've got the runes lit up for communication purposes. Everything seems to be functioning. So you have your free heal. You guys also once upon a time bought some old potions from, I think his name was like Melvin or something like that. There's a guy you met you bought some potions from and some syringes from. So you have, I think, some spare healing stuff.
Kaladen Shash 01:39:41 OK, I don't have any of the other things in my inventory, but if this armor suits ready to go. That's a 2D4 plus two. OK. All right, all right, giddy up. I'll help her help her 15.
Dungeon Master 01:39:50 Since you guys got your own midnight gear, it is 44 plus 4. Yes.
Zariel Torgan 01:39:55 Damn. That's pretty good. Yeah, if it's on yourself, yeah. Oh, it's, yeah, suit, nevermind, sorry.
Kaladen Shash 01:40:11 Is that a bonus action? OK, cool. So and then. Let's cast a spell this thing. I think I'm going to use a chromatic orb at first level and all. I'll hurl a ball of ice at it.
Dungeon Master 01:40:42 Go ahead and roll to hit. 14 does not hit. I will say with your natural 20, you did not drop less. You're down and up was so quick that concentration did not break. 16 does not hit.
Kaladen Shash 01:40:45 14 doesn't does hit oh plus. Plus a D4 on the. 16. OK, that's alright, we're finding out what the number is. That's right, I just came back up. I'm OK with that.
Kaladen Shash 01:41:15 That'll end my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:41:18 Okay up next Leopold you just watched as you were just happenstance out of range this dragon sort of just like like almost like it was resting and bathing just sort of emerged out of this magma pit locked eyes on the group so almost looked like it maliciously smiled before
Dungeon Master 01:41:40 viewing out this explosion of flame that literally roasted one of your friends and brought Zariel out of his spider form into a crispy form of himself in one single motion. It is your turn, what would you like to do?
Leopold Magnus 01:41:56 Oh, dear. Oh, dear, gents. This one's not looking good. He's got quite the wicked smile on him. I am going to use my action to do my hand crossbow. And I'm just going to roll the hit. And then it's a d4. His bless is still up.
Dungeon Master 01:42:19 Go for it. Yep. Absolutely. 21 hits.
Leopold Magnus 01:42:30 So he'll take 10 damage from that hand crossbow, and I'll yell, take that, you filthy animal. My bonus action, I'll pull up magic stone.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:37 Sweet. We literally caught it bathing.
Kaladen Shash 01:42:39 Silence.
Dungeon Master 01:43:00 the trusted duo. It said the trusted duo of Leopold is his magic stone with something else. And then you
Leopold Magnus 01:43:00 And I'm going to... What's that? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, it's the only thing I got. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Those things are doing damage. The challenge is I don't have anything else for a bonus action, so I'll just... Yeah, I'll back off.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:11 Oh, absolutely. You've done more damage with that rock than anything else in the campaign. I'm pretty upset.
Dungeon Master 01:43:30 Okay, back way off. Next up is Zariel.
Kaladen Shash 01:43:35 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:40 about getting merc'd so hard. I'm going to go ahead and cast Faerie Fire on it. DC 15 DEX save.
Dungeon Master 01:44:13 Dex save 18.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:24 Alright, it doesn't do anything. Just a flash of that iridescent light shoots across the square area, nothing. Bonus action... I really don't have any bonus actions. I can't cast a spell as a bonus action after just using a spell for an action, right?
Dungeon Master 01:44:49 Unless it's just a cantrip, that was a bonus action. Bonus action heal. Regular healing potion. Yeah. Sorry, it's not a minor, it's a regular. It's 44 plus 4.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:53 Gotcha. I don't have any cantrips that are bonus action. So I guess I'll just use my suit's healing now that I'm back in human form, or close enough to human. Oh, I was gonna use the suit. Can I use the suit? Okay. Okay, gotcha. So it'd be 14. All right, that's my turn. Actually, I'll move...
Dungeon Master 01:45:20 Yep. OK. Awesome. You shoot your fairy fire, and it all happens so fast because it's turn neck. You see it's very agile in it.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:23 I'll move my full distance right about here. All right, that's all I got.
Dungeon Master 01:45:39 leaps and almost sort of glides with its wings sort of to this large mound here, perches on the side before jumping down with the rest of its movement, landing here, going for the greater concentration. We'll see, does it get its breath weapon back? With a one, it does not.
Zariel Torgan 01:46:01 Jesus Christ. Nice. Nice. We needed that.
Kaladen Shash 01:46:10 Yep. That's a mess.
Dungeon Master 01:46:11 Yeah, you did. That could have been bad. It'll, it's got three attacks, so it'll jump up forward and do one claw as it runs past, and then it will, oh, that was the wrong movement. It'll just do all three attacks on you. That's all it can do. Believe that's a miss. 14.
Dungeon Master 01:46:43 Second claw attack. The 25. You take 16 points of damage. Drops you and then you see it shifts immediately to Leopold as its next target.
Zariel Torgan 01:46:49 Hmm. God damn. Oh. Do it again.
Kaladen Shash 01:46:52 Yeah, it's no matter what. That's exactly what I have. Were we just here a second ago?
Dungeon Master 01:47:10 Kaladin, on your turn, give me a death saving throw. You swore. You were a failure.
Kaladen Shash 01:47:21 Ugh, poor.
Dungeon Master 01:47:26 You are standing there as this dragon literally like with blinding speed jumps past the very fire hits the mound, bounds forward, splashes you once as it turns to go to count towards Leopold, you see, as you fall backwards, its tail swipes overhead, you hit the ground, and your image flashes to the field of just wheat grass as you hit the ground and then you blackout for a second before looking back up at the top of the cave. Leopold your turn.
Leopold Magnus 01:47:58 Yeah, so I'm going to go in the direction of Kaladin. Let's see, I've got 30 feet. Looks like about that distance for me. He's 20 feet. So I'll move over here.
Dungeon Master 01:48:15 Map is to scale. Nice, is that a save or an attack? Go ahead and roll. 24 hits.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:19 And as I run by the dragon, I'm just going to kind of flip around, and out my sleeve is going to eject a metal tube, and it's just going to spray a ray of frost up the front of this dragon. To hit. 24 to hit. Excellent.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:37 Nice. Nice.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:50 So he'll take seven frost damage, if that's important. Got it. Okay. And with my bonus action, I will administer one of my syringes to Kaladin.
Dungeon Master 01:48:57 It is not, but good to know. It doesn't seem to be reduced at all. It's taking the full damage, but it's not especially effective. Perfect.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:06 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 01:49:23 Well then old chap, looks like you've taken quite a beating. And I'll just stuff one of those syringes right into his chest and hit inject. 3D4 plus 4.
Dungeon Master 01:49:34 Perfect. Easy enough. Go ahead and roll 44 plus 4. This is what happens when you roll a natural 1 on an encounter check. Yeah. Crazy enough, this is the same CR as what you guys just caught last session.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:39 Nice. I thought it was going to be like kobolds or something. Well, anytime you fight a dragon, it's always very lopsided. Either they get their breath weapon off or they don't.
Kaladen Shash 01:49:45 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:50:07 Right. He's up.
Leopold Magnus 01:50:07 Ouch, low roll, but it's plus four, so you get 11 heals, Kaladin.
Kaladen Shash 01:50:14 OK, that's better than dead.
Zariel Torgan 01:50:20 Are you going to stay there, Leo, or are you going to flank or something?
Leopold Magnus 01:50:32 Yeah, I'll shift my weight just to take an opposing stance with the Dragon, so that way Kaladin can at least have some flanking.
Dungeon Master 01:50:40 OK. Beautiful. At the end of your turn, Zahra, it is your go.
Zariel Torgan 01:50:49 I'm going to move up my full movement of 30. That was a little extra. Come back a little. Let's see. I don't have a lot of options, so I guess I'll... It's already up.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:22 I'll uh... I'll throw an Ice Knife. Goddamn. Yeah. Uh, 10. Alright. So that's gonna be 2d6. Hold. Uh, yes.
Dungeon Master 01:51:27 Go for it. It still explodes. It does miss though. Set a deck save on the explosion.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:53 And that's going to be a deck save of 15. Aha, damn. Alright, well it still takes... Oh, does it take half on a success? Or does it just take... No, it's a first level.
Dungeon Master 01:52:03 Roll a natural 20. I don't know on Ice Knife. Ice Knife is a cantrip for a first level spell. If it's above cantrip, chances are they take half.
Zariel Torgan 01:52:23 Well, it doesn't say that explicitly, so I'll leave it up to you. It just says, hit or miss, the shard explodes, a target and each creature within 5 feet must succeed on a dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 cold. So it kind of sounds like it might just be... Meow. Alright, well, I don't have any bonuses that I can do realistically. So, okay.
Dungeon Master 01:52:35 It does not. Yeah. You see it just swipes it with its tail. Start of initiative. The dragon gets to go. See if it gets its breath weapon. Does not. You see at this point it's not appearing as though it's very threatened.
Dungeon Master 01:53:04 So it's very playful. Maybe this is the most action it's seen in a while. It bats the ice knight, turns to look at you. As it does, it puts one claw at Leopold. Less as like a straightforward attack, but just like a swipe as it repositions, but it's gonna roll the attack there. Oh, that was for the wrong one, but that's still the same modifier.
Dungeon Master 01:53:31 uh with a 12 that misses can it get to you it does you see it leaps forward charging at you first uh you guys do get attacks of opportunity but it will make a claw and a bite at zariel who seems to be hearing it from afar
Leopold Magnus 01:54:02 Yeah, I'm going to attack it with my bolt. My hand bolt. 21 to hit. Takes 9 damage.
Kaladen Shash 01:54:15 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:54:19 21 hits. No, my thing got really slow. What did it say I got for the bite? Oh, that was to hit Leopold. That was the wrong thing, but it's the same modifier. I rolled the claw, but I disconnected at the same time, so it didn't roll.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:29 I saw your bite, but I can't see your claw. 12. Oh. So probably missed then. Yeah, that hits. 16 misses.
Dungeon Master 01:54:49 29 to hit. And, uh, 16. Yes, you both can take Attacks of Opportunity. Zaryl, you take 14 points of slashing damage.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:00 Did Calla didn't want to try to hit it as it runs away? OK. Nice.
Kaladen Shash 01:55:05 I didn't know that was an option. Alright, yes, I would like to have taken an attack of opportunity. 21 to hit.
Leopold Magnus 01:55:07 Yeah, it left our space.
Dungeon Master 01:55:20 Okay, go ahead and take your attack. He takes 9 damage from when Leopold hit it. 21 hits. 14 damage. Doesn't do anything extra.
Kaladen Shash 01:55:37 Boom, it's radiant. I don't know if that makes any difference. Yep. Two-handed swing. Two-handed swing.
Leopold Magnus 01:55:40 Damn, that's a pretty sweet weapon. 1d10 plus 3 plus 1d10 or 1d6.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:47 That's pretty great. Hey, Jonathan.
Dungeon Master 01:55:49 Yeah, longsword is the... Wait, it's a d10? Oh, I made a very bad call. Yeah, 1d10 and then d6 of either radiant or necrotic and 3 is the modifier. But it should be... Oh no, that's your strength. That makes sense. Yeah, okay. Good damage. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:56:11 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:14 So I'm just now reading, because I was looking at my bonus actions. Apparently I can wild shape as a bonus action, and I didn't use my bonus action on the last turn. Could I have transformed into my bear shape at the end of my last turn? Okay, alright. I'll take that 14 damage as a bear. I'll just add it back to my regular character real fast.
Dungeon Master 01:56:21 Mhm. Yes. You got it.
Kaladen Shash 01:56:40 Question, does the hat change? Is it scene and mood appropriate? Does it?
Leopold Magnus 01:56:46 I'd like to think he just keeps it in his bag. And as soon as he turns into a bear, he kind of delicately picks it out of his satchel and puts it on. It's kind of a miracle it stays on top of your head, just like no obvious connection point.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:55 Yeah, I take it out and I place it very delicately. Yeah, it just, yeah, it's a miracle is what it is. All right, yeah, I just get blasted as a bear. Okay, I'm good.
Dungeon Master 01:57:14 OK. And then I'm reloading my page because it's being real slow. It will use the rest of its movement to jump back at Kaladin, who did the most damage. So Zorro, you can also make an attack of opportunity if you'd like. But it can do there.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:29 Alright, I'm gonna tip my hat to him. With that, I will take my claw attack. It's gonna be a 21 to hit. Alright, that's gonna be 9 slashing damage.
Dungeon Master 01:57:45 21 hits. 9 damage. Okay, Kaladin, it is your turn.
Kaladen Shash 01:58:12 I'm. I'm going to cast. Mirror image. Excel. And then. I'm just going to get some space in case it wants to attack us both. I'm just gonna like flank around its side over here.
Zariel Torgan 01:58:21 Smart.
Kaladen Shash 01:58:44 We need to attack it from all sides. And I think that's my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:58:58 OK. Leopold, it is your turn.
Leopold Magnus 01:59:04 All sides, Kaladin, I'm on it. And I kind of plant my knee down on the ground and my steel defender melds out of my armor into its own figure. And he will be told to charge forward and take the missing flank.
Zariel Torgan 01:59:13 Oh. Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:59:25 Awesome. Let me get him pulled up, but that's your action. Go for it.
Kaladen Shash 01:59:29 It's pretty cool.
Leopold Magnus 01:59:31 Then I will also back off and try to take opposite angles, such that you can't easily position the breath. And then with my bonus action, I will attempt an attack with a magic stone. Oh, I think that's gonna, even with a four, I don't think that'll land. 16 doesn't hit, does it?
Dungeon Master 02:00:00 Just doesn't find purchases, bounces off the scales.
Leopold Magnus 02:00:02 The stone goes wide, reflecting off of the beast's thick hide. Oh, OK. That wouldn't have mattered. I don't think that's changed any rolls. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:00:08 I don't think we have... Yeah, I don't think we have BlessUp anymore, do we? No, no, yeah, I just, yeah. Yeah, yeah, well, a natural 20 is pretty fantastic.
Kaladen Shash 02:00:16 No. I took a second fall. That was generous that he let me keep it up the first time. That was awesome.
Dungeon Master 02:00:30 Steel Defender go on the summon, or does it go next round? Go for it, and he's got 21 HP or more.
Leopold Magnus 02:00:35 Yeah, it's immediately after my turn. Let's see. Yes, 21, I think. No, 26 hit points. Yeah, so then I'll just do a Force Empowered Rend, which is a plus 8 to hit.
Dungeon Master 02:01:05 Go for it. That would hit. Nine damage. Nicely done. Is that all it can do on its turn?
Leopold Magnus 02:01:07 I believe that would hit, right? 25? Excellent. So the Force Empowered Wren, 1d8 plus 3. Not bad. 9 damage.
Leopold Magnus 02:01:35 Yep, that'll take us position there.
Dungeon Master 02:01:39 Perfect. Zahra, you're go. Yes. 25.
Zariel Torgan 02:01:41 I'm gonna make my movement up to flank with the steel defender. And as a bear, I'm gonna make two attacks. Would I get advantage? Okay. And so I'll make my bite attack with advantage. That's gonna be a 25 to hit. And my claw attack.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:07 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:02:09 21 hits. 113.25, damn it.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:11 is going to be a 21 to hit. All right, so that's going to be 12 piercing damage for the bite, and then 13 slashing damage for the claws as I rover over it. And then since we're all connected mentally, in my head as a bear, I'm just like, yeah. Just yelling a lot because I'm not used to thinking as a bear.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:43 You would always do it in your head. Yes. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:46 just like doing my own theme music, like... Yeah. It's like... It's like Kronk from Emperor's New Groove, where he's doing his own Mission Impossible music. All right.
Leopold Magnus 02:02:54 I was wondering what he was saying. Geez. To get a peek behind that curtain. Fuck him up, Kaladin.
Dungeon Master 02:03:11 at the start of the round. It is the dragon's turn. We'll see if it gets its breath weapon back. Two doesn't do it. It'll just go left, right, left. So two attacks on the steel defender, one on the bear. Claw, claw, bite. So the steel defender will take... We'll see.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:17 Oh, Jesus Christ. Nice. Nice!
Kaladen Shash 02:03:32 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:03:39 That's the AC-15. It needs to roll really poorly. Oh, wow. OK. Oh, it misses.
Dungeon Master 02:03:41 Okay. He has a plus 10 to hit. So anything five and at bottom. Yeah. First attack 20. It's rolls only eight points of damage, two ones. Uh, the next attack would have been the bite. Uh, ooh, 12 to hit. And then the other one was a claw attack against
Zariel Torgan 02:03:51 Damn. Wow. Nice. It's 12.
Kaladen Shash 02:04:06 That's fantastic. That's enough. What's the Bears AC? Wow.
Dungeon Master 02:04:13 That's a 16. Two ones on the damage, again, eight more points of damage. Wow, you guys are getting real fucking lucky. Round four, only one breath weapon, and I've rolled minimum damage three times.
Zariel Torgan 02:04:26 Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:04:41 You see, uh, not as healthy as it was. It had it will. Got a good fly speed, it'll just. Same spot, just launch up into the air. You see it spins twice before its wings eject and catch it and start flapping. You both will be still defender and the bear will get attacks of opportunity, but the dragon will be 40 feet in the air.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:14 And these would still be with advantage, right? I'll do a claw attack. It's going to be a natural 20. Oh, I was just rolling twice.
Dungeon Master 02:05:17 Yes, because you'd have advantage when it was leaving your space. Go and roll double damage. Damn 14. Oh it. OK.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:47 I try to do crit damage, but it doesn't add the modifier. So I usually just... Alright. Ricks.
Dungeon Master 02:05:51 No, it doesn't uh, so that's uh 18 Uh still defender It still has reactions, yeah
Leopold Magnus 02:06:06 The Steel Defender only goes after my turn. Oh, or unless he's moving through. Oh, oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. 1d8 to hit. That would be a 19 to hit.
Kaladen Shash 02:06:10 Rick. OK.
Dungeon Master 02:06:24 19 hits. I got four points of damage. Nicely done. Up next, Kaladin. That was the end of its turn that that happened.
Zariel Torgan 02:06:27 Nice, nice. Yeah, 24 just on that little movement.
Leopold Magnus 02:06:36 Six damage on that swing.
Kaladen Shash 02:06:56 Uhm, I would. From where I'm standing, I'm going to cast told the dead 60 foot rate 60 foot range. I don't need to make. That's a wisdom saving throw. Good Sir. Oh, it makes the save. It doesn't take any damage, just flat out miss.
Zariel Torgan 02:07:03 Interesting. I feel like it's not that wise.
Dungeon Master 02:07:04 Is that a con save? That is 16. Damn.
Leopold Magnus 02:07:12 Oh, I'd like to see this.
Kaladen Shash 02:07:29 It's OK, it's OK. I'm going to use that opportunity to go ahead and scurry back. Several more feet just to keep that breath weapon at bay.
Dungeon Master 02:07:44 Nice. OK. Unless any of you have anything else, Leopold, it is your turn.
Leopold Magnus 02:07:51 Um, yeah. So let's see. I'm going to try and kind of position myself, uh, just skirting back here and I will cast the, uh, catapult. Um, so larger boulder, one of these kind of slag mites I could break off the cave.
Dungeon Master 02:08:15 Mm-hmm. We've entered. Entered a DEX save. Natural 18, 22. Sales-wide. Doesn't do any damage.
Leopold Magnus 02:08:19 And I will cast that at the second level. It is a deck save, 16. So... I take half. Oh, it doesn't do any damage if it passes?
Zariel Torgan 02:08:25 Mm. Goddamn. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:08:39 Those were some great saves.
Dungeon Master 02:08:47 No, it just goes right by it. Also misses. Unfortunate.
Leopold Magnus 02:08:49 Oh, interesting, okay. So yeah, misses wide. And with my bonus action, I will do a stone. So I think I have two more up. Ah, for fuck's sake, nine. That was not it.
Zariel Torgan 02:09:10 Mm.
Dungeon Master 02:09:13 With its height, too, the stone has trouble finding good purchase at it, just sort of hitting. It's sort of like claws, as it is, like, pelting things away from above. Immediately after you Steel Defender goes, does the Steel Defender have any ranged attacks?
Leopold Magnus 02:09:31 I don't know. I think he just has this force-impaired rend, which is a melee attack. Oh, did it fly up into the air? Ah, OK. I missed that bit. But what it can do is repair, which will give me 2d8 plus 3 hit points. So I'll do that.
Kaladen Shash 02:09:41 Yep.
Dungeon Master 02:09:42 Okay, the dragon is 40 feet away, so I don't know that it can do anything. It's 40 feet in the area.
Zariel Torgan 02:10:04 Good call.
Leopold Magnus 02:10:06 OK, so 13, 13 heels. It was at 18, so that's 13. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:10:13 Oh yeah, what is it down to? Oh, so it's back up to full then. Don't have to adjust it. Great. OK, Zariel, your turn. Do you have anything ranged in this one?
Zariel Torgan 02:10:33 As a bonus action, I can drop my form. I'm gonna bonus action, revert back to a guy. And then I'm going to cast a Call Lightning. So I'm gonna get a deck save.
Dungeon Master 02:10:56 Another 18 for 22. Why?
Leopold Magnus 02:10:56 Now, when you trains it out of your form, how does that look with your hat? Do you take it off first? It turns into spaghetti. Interesting.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:03 The hat just... it turns into spaghetti. Oof. And it just turns into, like, my mop hair. Alright. Alright, um... I guess I will just move... like, this way a little bit.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:28 The cloud is still there, the cloud forms, the lightning does strike out, but it does not find its target. Does it do half damage, or does it... Oh yeah, it takes half damage. Ouch.
Dungeon Master 02:11:51 Alrighty. Takes three. I give it three. Okay. Uh, at the end of your turn, it'll be the dragon's turn. Start of the round. We'll see if it gets that breath weapon. Four does not do it.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:58 Yeah, that's rough. I think we round down, don't we? It's rough. All right, that's my turn.
Kaladen Shash 02:12:18 Yes, it would appear that way right now.
Dungeon Master 02:12:21 It is 40 feet in the air. It is assessing for the biggest threat. Oh, you're no longer a bear. Caledon, you are looking the most hurt, correct? OK. It is a smart creature.
Zariel Torgan 02:12:35 I'm still, yeah. Yes.
Dungeon Master 02:12:50 It does see the cloud above it. It looks at you. I think in this moment, it's not going to assess you as big of a threat. It'll dive down at the person hearing it so well from a distance and make all of its attacks on Zahrael. Yes, sir. I call lightning. Hold on.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:13 On me? Oh, shit. Miss. All right.
Dungeon Master 02:13:21 29 to hit. Natural 19. Yeah. 12 points of damage. Rolled real low again. Second claw attack. Might miss. 18.
Kaladen Shash 02:13:29 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:13:52 Is that a hit? Okay. And that is 11 points of damage on that one. Are you still up? I don't think it's bite. 23 to hit. And you take...
Zariel Torgan 02:13:54 Yeah, yeah, it's yeah. Alright, yeah, I'm still up. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:13:54 Yeah, it says 17.
Dungeon Master 02:14:26 18 plus 1 point of fire damage. 18 piercing, 1 fire. You see it downs Zariel and doesn't do anything with his body, but it has 80 feet fly. It's only used 40. It launches back up in the air, and it's going to...
Zariel Torgan 02:14:33 All right, I am down.
Dungeon Master 02:14:55 head it's sort of going arcing so it's going like 30 feet up 10 feet forward up into the air seems to be heading towards leopold at this point but that is the end of its turn kaladin is your go
Kaladen Shash 02:15:10 Uhm? I'm gonna throw chromatic orb at it. At first level again. Natural one does not hit anything.
Zariel Torgan 02:15:39 Oof.
Dungeon Master 02:15:40 does not. Would you like that to hit? What are you doing? Does Kaladin want this to hit at this point? He has missed quite a few times recently.
Kaladen Shash 02:15:40 Little bummer. Oops. I don't know why I rolled again. I don't know what's happening As it just kept rerolling things I don't know what that was about Is he hasn't been hasn't been at his sharpest it feels like um, I
Kaladen Shash 02:16:10 I mean, I would feel a strong urge to try to defeat this, knowing that Zariel is now down.
Dungeon Master 02:16:18 You hear your heart pounding in your ears as you're like, you've got your wizard's spell book projecting out of your armor and you're like, through the blood of your eyes, trying to decipher the spell that it's projecting so that you can cast. You look up frantic and you stop hearing everything. You stop hearing the roar of the dragon, the beating of the wings. You stop hearing your heartbeat and you just hear the thrum.
Dungeon Master 02:16:48 from down to the back of the chamber. And as you let your spell go wide, you realize you missed your target. And then you make a fist and you pull it at the last second. And the spell that was sailing over its head takes a 90 degree bend and launches directly into the dragon. You can roll damage on that. You do take a stress point.
Zariel Torgan 02:17:15 Nice! How many you at now, Kaladin?
Kaladen Shash 02:17:16 OK, so it's good for 17. Ice damage. I think that gives me three now. Let me see my inventory brother. Yeah, my stress point currently says two. This puts me at three.
Dungeon Master 02:17:20 Big bitch. I think it's obvious.
Leopold Magnus 02:17:32 You have three stress points? I think I only have one. Yeah. One. Zariel, you have what, four? Jesus.
Zariel Torgan 02:17:49 Yeah, I got four. I'm racing to the finish line.
Dungeon Master 02:17:51 Good for her. Anything else on your turn, Calvin?
Kaladen Shash 02:17:52 Giddy up. I would just yell, or not yell, but psychically say, Leopold, can you help him up at all?
Leopold Magnus 02:18:16 I think I could get it handled. So it's diving towards me, yeah? OK, yeah, I am going to cast Hideous Laughter at the dragon.
Dungeon Master 02:18:22 Leopold, you are up. As this dragon is hurtling towards you through the air, you act first. Yes. All this happens sort of simultaneously, but you just get to do something before it gets to you.
Kaladen Shash 02:18:23 I love you. It's a good chance here.
Leopold Magnus 02:18:45 So wisdom save 16. Oh, he fails. Uh, right. Yeah. I don't know exactly how this spell works. Do I say something? Is that what makes him laugh?
Zariel Torgan 02:18:47 Hmm. What do you say to make it laugh? Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:18:54 Yes. We just got through a dad joke out there.
Dungeon Master 02:18:54 fifth in
Leopold Magnus 02:19:11 I'll just yell out, hey, what do you call an alligator in a vest? And I'll just run underneath him as he's kind of diving towards me towards Zario. And as he's about to reach me, I'll just say an investigator. And I'll go over here and I'll use my bonus action to pick sorry. How many syringes do we have or can I administer one of his?
Zariel Torgan 02:19:30 Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:19:30 Your student has one each. And if you had extras, well, yours can only be used for yourself. So my assumption was that you used a different one for talent.
Kaladen Shash 02:19:40 Like hit a suit button manually. Or one of the purchased quantities. Can you manually engage that for his suit?
Leopold Magnus 02:19:43 Yeah. OK, I've consumed mine on Kaladin. Ah.
Dungeon Master 02:19:58 Your suit just injects you. You can force Pizda. If he hasn't used his, you can use it, but I'm not sure if he's used his already.
Zariel Torgan 02:20:10 I have used mine. But I think we spread out the potions, so I think I have a couple. Oh. Okay, well then yeah, I have them.
Kaladen Shash 02:20:12 OK. If you have a couple, then we didn't spread them out, so I don't have any in my inventory.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:22 Uh... Oh, you do? Okay, I don't... Yeah, I don't have any in my inventory either. Well, that's easy. I'll just administer one of the potions in his inventory to him. Is that okay?
Dungeon Master 02:20:39 Okay, yeah, make sure you guys are adjusting that. I don't know the ones last time you bought any. But go ahead and roll. I don't know what you guys had bought. Is it a regular, a minor, a greater?
Zariel Torgan 02:20:45 Yeah, let me make that right. Yeah, I'll take one off now. 2D4 plus 2.
Kaladen Shash 02:20:53 I think they were regulated for their minor behaviors.
Leopold Magnus 02:21:04 And with the hideous laughter, the creature falls prone. Right.
Dungeon Master 02:21:11 Yes, I am reading it. Target must succeed a wisdom save or fall prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand up for the duration at the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, the target can make another wisdom saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if it is triggered by damage on a success dispel ends. We will get to that.
Zariel Torgan 02:21:30 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 02:21:32 So does it take damage, I guess, if it was flying in midair and then falls prone? Okay. Nope, that is it.
Dungeon Master 02:21:42 But anything else on your turn? Awesome, okay. It has not hit the ground yet. It hits the ground on its turn, so your Steel Defender can move into position and hold its action, but it still can't technically hit it at this point.
Leopold Magnus 02:22:03 Yes, I'll position a Steel Defender near the Dragon Impact and poise for an attack. Yep. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:22:09 You think it doesn't hit where you would collide into the wall as it moves forward. Somewhere right up here would be perfect positioning. Okay, holds its action to attack. Zariel started your turn. You are not incapacitated. You spring forward right beforehand. You are prone, but you have your full turn.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:35 Alright, I'm gonna again cast Call Lightning. Gonna be a DC 15 dex save. Better. So he succeeds, but he's gonna take 5 lightning damage. And then...
Dungeon Master 02:22:52 Dirty 20. Half damage.
Zariel Torgan 02:23:03 I have one more regular healing potion. I'm just gonna save it. And I cast a spell as my action. So yeah, that's my turn. Actually, I'll move to split the distance here. Just in case he gets his breath weapon back.
Dungeon Master 02:23:25 Okay, the end of your turn. A couple things are going to happen at the very start of this turn. We're just going to see if he gets it back, even if he can't use it. That's another one. Does not get its breath weapon. It collides into the ground. It was 30 feet up, so it takes 1d6 of fall damage after the first 10 feet, so it'll take 2d6 falling damage.
Zariel Torgan 02:23:37 Nice. Nice. Nice.
Kaladen Shash 02:23:38 Odds are rolling here. April. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:23:55 It takes 7 points of damage. But it gets to make a Wisdom saving throw with advantage because it took damage. Otherwise it would just make it at the end of its turn. Dirty 20.
Leopold Magnus 02:23:56 Ah. Yeah, it's a 16, so he he's no longer laughing.
Zariel Torgan 02:24:06 Now is that? Oh, I see what you're saying.
Kaladen Shash 02:24:13 End of his turn, yeah. What's the same? It's the same, the same every time. Yeah, he's not laughing anymore. That's what made him stop. I think that was funny.
Dungeon Master 02:24:26 he hits the ground not laughing it happened before the end of his turn you see like he is flying through the air he is keen on attacking you you say that joke and for the first moment in this entire fight you hear just like
Dungeon Master 02:24:45 audible laughter that you would hear out of a vocal creature, and then he slams into the wall and starts roaring, instantly ending, he sits back up, your Steel Defender can take it, it's attacked. To not roll my Breath weapon after six rounds is insane. I would not.
Leopold Magnus 02:24:58 Nice, yeah, he will take an attack. I don't think that hits, because it's a plus 8, so 13, yeah. OK.
Kaladen Shash 02:25:00 I'm going to
Zariel Torgan 02:25:17 Was he prone? That's what I get. That's what I get. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:25:20 No, he got it. Well, at this point, I would say it all happened at once. He'd be prone. You could have advantage on that. Does not hit. Okay. He will use half his movement and stand up. And he will take... That means he's got... Okay, he can do both.
Leopold Magnus 02:25:29 Ah. The dice has fallen.
Dungeon Master 02:25:47 He'll take two attacks at the Steel Defender. He's looking incredibly injured at this point. First attack is a 15 that misses. Oh, it is. Okay, so first one hit, second one. 19 hits.
Leopold Magnus 02:26:05 I think his AC is 15, so yeah, that hits. Yeah, both hit. Drops to 12 points.
Kaladen Shash 02:26:09 Thank you for your patience.
Dungeon Master 02:26:16 Those are both Claw. I know one says Bite, but they're the same modifier, so he takes two Claw attacks. 15 damage. Is the Steel Defender down? Okay, and then one more attack. Well, he already rolled the hit, so it's one more round of damage. Takes... 11 points of damage.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:26 One point.
Leopold Magnus 02:26:42 That's one point. Yeah, that connects.
Dungeon Master 02:26:47 Furious that it didn't finish off. He's gonna take his bite and you see he just goes to bite overhead the still defender 26 to hit There there to roll to everybody I'm not hiding anything right now it takes 13 piercing with
Zariel Torgan 02:27:01 It's a lot of 16s you're rolling. I know, I know.
Dungeon Master 02:27:11 a 6 fire damage, there's that 6 on the d6, and you see it consumes the Steel Defender, just chomps down, eats it, Steel Defender is no longer present. Wary of being knocked out of the sky again, he used half his movement, he has...
Leopold Magnus 02:27:24 Bone pressure, no! You rancid beast, you'll pay for that!
Dungeon Master 02:27:39 40 feet normal, so he's got 20 more feet. You see he will move back, almost looking a little cornered. Not quite to your snare, but you notice that he gets close to it as he's sort of like scooching back. You can see his feet approaching it. He is not aware of it as he is watching you guys. Up next, Kaladin.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:01 I will move forward a few feet. To be in range and. I'll do the same later. Last time I'll cast. Actually, let's have a little have a little fun.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:39 Um, I'm going to use all of my movement. Yeah. I'm going to move forward another 20 feet. That should put me within at least 30 feet, 30 feet. Uh, and I'm gonna.
Dungeon Master 02:28:53 Okay. Do so with advantage.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:56 Hey. Pat was getting into his water. Still not cool. Mm. Yeah, sweet.
Kaladen Shash 02:29:10 I'm going to cast or I'm going to use the arc slash charge. In the sword. To make like a ranged melee attack. Oh yes, it's meant to be. Uhm? So.
Zariel Torgan 02:29:29 Oh, nice.
Dungeon Master 02:29:30 Natural 20. Double modifier, so it's double everything. So it'd be 2D10 plus 6.
Leopold Magnus 02:29:30 Hell yeah. You're going to cut this fucking dragon's head off.
Kaladen Shash 02:29:41 What does that do to the 2D10 plus 6 or plus 3? And then what do I get? Is it still a 1D6 on the radiant or is it a 2D6?
Dungeon Master 02:30:04 2D hit. Here's 2D. Everything is double. 18 damage. Good chunk, not dead, but you see a huge hit, slashes.
Zariel Torgan 02:30:08 Shit dude, I was worried. Here I was worried that trap was gonna kill him. Goddamn.
Kaladen Shash 02:30:12 Oh, it's a really soft roll, but still fun. A lot of fun flavor there.
Leopold Magnus 02:30:22 Awesome.
Dungeon Master 02:30:22 I'll just give it just for fun. You see one of its wings gets cut into and the thin skin that stretches between each of the phalanges in the wing tears sort of one wing out of commission at this point. Finger bones.
Zariel Torgan 02:30:38 belaying cheese. I know I just like the word. That was fantastic. You did
Kaladen Shash 02:30:42 I'm going to use my bonus action to use my misty step. Move back out of the way.
Dungeon Master 02:31:01 Okay, Leopold, your turn.
Leopold Magnus 02:31:07 Uh, yeah, so, furious that he's downed my defender, I'm gonna step up right in front of him, square up, and I'll bend to a 90 degree angle, and you hear this whirling noise, and one of my arms fishes around for a large stone on the ground, stuffs it into my chest cavity, my head bent down, peering between my legs, yelling at Zariel, watch out, this one's gonna really rip!
Leopold Magnus 02:31:36 And I blast off a brick, casting Catapult. Yeah, deck saves 16. Ugh. Yeah, well that misses.
Zariel Torgan 02:31:41 Oh, I thought you were doing doo-doo maker. It's all right. It's all been built up for him to back up and step on that trap and have the trap kill him.
Dungeon Master 02:31:42 Go ahead and deck save. Roll. Say natural 20.
Kaladen Shash 02:32:12 Hey Jonathan. Uhm? I have a great weapon fighter and I can reroll ones and twos on the damage dice. Can I? Can I reroll my one in my two? Yeah. OK, OK.
Dungeon Master 02:32:14 Mhm. Mhm. Uh, that's for if. For melee attacks. But not ranged, correct? Or is it also for ranged?
Zariel Torgan 02:32:21 Oh, nice.
Kaladen Shash 02:32:41 No, it's just, it's a melee attack. I didn't know if arc slash is still a melee.
Dungeon Master 02:32:44 Okay, follow-up question. Did I specify arc slash as being like melee spell or do I say melee range? I mean, sorry, ranged. If I specified you can have it if it says like it's just a melee attack at range.
Kaladen Shash 02:33:09 No, it sounds like you can shoot radiant damage. It has both 15 or range. It says range. It says range attack. OK, that's all right. I'm just trying. Nope, I'm going to try.
Dungeon Master 02:33:13 okay yeah i figured it was just a normal range but i wanted to make sure okay no good looking out uh leopold anything as a bonus
Leopold Magnus 02:33:29 okay and uh yeah with my bonus action i'll use the last stone i'm gonna try and hit him just in the foot so that way he steps off balance backwards into the snap 26 to hit
Zariel Torgan 02:33:40 Oh, yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:33:45 If it kills him, that's what can happen, but I'm not going to let you off-balance him just because I didn't roll your attack. Love that. 26 hit. Thicker points of damage. Getting close, guys. This could be the last round. No!
Kaladen Shash 02:33:55 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 02:33:59 Six damage. He wasn't startled, he didn't step backwards. Alright, that's my turn.
Dungeon Master 02:34:20 Okay, Zahra, your turn. Tech save. Okay. Ooh, 13. Take damage.
Zariel Torgan 02:34:25 I'm gonna make another lightning shoot down. Dex. 15. Come on. Come on. That is a failure. And I rolled a lot better. 19 lightning damage.
Dungeon Master 02:34:49 19 points of damage. So, so hurt. He's not down. He's not down. I will tell you. I will tell you he had 24 points of HP.
Zariel Torgan 02:34:55 Oh, you're not going to give it to me? So close. All right. God, what do I have as a bonus? Nothing. Oh.
Kaladen Shash 02:34:58 Here it comes. It just wants to use that breath weapon so bad. Right now? Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:35:14 He's at five currently. No, he's now at five. You almost killed him with that. No. If you'd like to close the distance, go for it.
Leopold Magnus 02:35:21 Get up there and push him!
Zariel Torgan 02:35:23 I was gonna say, can I use my bonus and my movement? I'm 28 feet away. Can I run and, like, shove him? Obviously that's not, like, rules or canon. Dammit. Dammit. Okay, I'm just gonna run. No, I wanna be in his face. I'm at, like, 80 points. I'm gonna go right over here.
Dungeon Master 02:35:44 What do you mean? OK. OK, he will on top of his round roll to see if he gets his breath weapon. He does.
Kaladen Shash 02:35:46 Here we go.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:51 Actually, I'll go over here. I don't want him to get any of us, any two of us with the breath. This sucks. Rough. Rough.
Dungeon Master 02:36:14 I've had it sitting over here hidden the whole time. Can I get both of you? Why is it so finicky? I don't. I think it's just one person.
Kaladen Shash 02:36:30 Can be hard pressed. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:36:44 Leopold, give me a Dexterity saving throw. He might. You're going to take half damage.
Leopold Magnus 02:36:47 You know, if you back up just a little bit, you might be able to have both of us. Dexter. Oh, a lot on my toes.
Zariel Torgan 02:36:51 It's not going to be enough, but it's nice. No chance.
Kaladen Shash 02:37:04 Yes, he is. He's gonna do it. He's gonna make it. He's gonna make it.
Dungeon Master 02:37:18 you take 33 points of damage. I don't know that it can do breath weapon and attacks.
Zariel Torgan 02:37:20 Oh my god. That's fantastic.
Leopold Magnus 02:37:24 Yeah, so my suit kind of erects its protective shielding and you can just start to see it melt away as my armor turns to magma. I roll out of the blast and dripping metal fling it off my arm. Woo, that was one hot blast.
Zariel Torgan 02:37:54 I had a nickel for every time I heard you say that. Oh, Jesus.
Leopold Magnus 02:37:59 Zario, it was like that time you were eating beans before bedtime. What are you asking? Me?
Dungeon Master 02:38:11 Yeah, it can either do breath weapon or attacks. Give me a pure luck check. You. You set the snare, let's see if he backs up. 18. Is there a snare mechanic for damage or what were you intending with this?
Zariel Torgan 02:38:23 Oh yeah, who do you need that from? Oh. I need this.
Leopold Magnus 02:38:31 Ooh, baby. Yeah, I think the snare is literally just a trap. It's a five-foot radius on the ground. It's invisible. Triggers when a creature moves over it. Must succeed a deck-saving throw or be magically hoisted in the air, leaving it hanging upside down three feet above the ground.
Dungeon Master 02:38:55 It rolls a three and got a seven. See this dragon takes a step back. You said it's hoisted three feet in the air. It just turns upside down.
Leopold Magnus 02:39:02 Reacher is restrained there until the spell ends. Nice. Hell yeah. Yeah, three feet in the air.
Zariel Torgan 02:39:09 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:39:13 Thread.
Dungeon Master 02:39:24 It's so big that it's body just physically flips. It is just mechanically prone, because it's too big to just do that, whatever you said. But you see it does this breath whip, and then it steps back, happy with what it did, and you see the truck goes, and it just flips in one smooth motion, eating shit on the ground. You see dust flips and settles. Kaladin, it is your turn.
Kaladen Shash 02:39:51 I'm going to use 30 feet of movement. And then I'm going to misty step another 30 feet, right up to its head. And as I appear, I'm just going to take a giant slice right through its neck.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:06 Yeah. What's your one liner? Do you have a one liner?
Dungeon Master 02:40:19 Roll with advantage. 18 does hit, but roll with advantage. He's prone. And plus, you gave yourself a stress point. You have advantage for the rest of the encounter. The 18 exactly hits.
Kaladen Shash 02:40:22 I don't think it hits 18. Ignite. Oh. OK, so 18 still hit. It would be 9. I don't know why it's not rolling the little 1D6 gradient. Here it comes. Both total.
Dungeon Master 02:40:52 It won't do it all at the same time. I think you have to roll the damage and then roll the d6. Always separate. There was no mechanic for like rolled d6 radiant or d6 necrotic, so it's just separate. What was your light splitter damage? Because it didn't come through. Okay. Well, how would you like to finish this dragon?
Kaladen Shash 02:40:58 Yeah, I usually type it in as trying to get it up, but. Yeah. Nine. Or just like that after. After Leopold made it look like a pinata, I would have just run forward like
Zariel Torgan 02:41:12 Okay. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:41:26 like anime style like sword hanging behind me like you know what i mean and then just disappear yeah exactly just disappear 30 feet away from it appear right in front of it mid swing and just not even look back as the sword slices like a giant gasp a minute
Dungeon Master 02:41:30 Mhm. Just carrying it back down. This dragon.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:46 Awesome.
Dungeon Master 02:41:50 who nearly killed the entire party. You see panic in its eyes as it underestimated its foes. Flipped on its back, all it sees from an upside down vision is you running on the ceiling, sword low and back, almost scraping on the ground. You see sparks of various colors of light hitting as the sword bounces. And in one single fluid motion, the dragon just watches its body
Dungeon Master 02:42:18 shift down three feet, looking, and then on the periphery of its vision, everything just starts to fade into black. As you watch, seven, 10, 15 seconds after you've cut clean through its head, the eyes slowly close as it passes. And you guys are out of initiative.
Leopold Magnus 02:42:44 Did the head get completely severed? Jesus. Hey, I finally got one of those. My snares never hit anything.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:45 I can't tell you how much I was hoping that that trap was going to do damage and kill it.
Dungeon Master 02:42:48 completely severed clean. I really thought the computer would tell me that it triggers a rock while it does 1d6 damage. And I imagine everyone's like,
Kaladen Shash 02:43:08 I love it. I love it. I love it. Yeah. What? It just piñata it. That's all it did. Just hung it up. Yeah, that was heated up. Teamwork, dream work.
Zariel Torgan 02:43:14 I was really like we have this epic battle and then like a rock falls and hits it in the head. Yeah. Yeah, if only OSHA was here. Oh, it was great. It's great. Give you advantage.
Dungeon Master 02:43:22 Just concussed.
Leopold Magnus 02:43:29 I mean, it set you up. That was awesome. You know, it's like a wing slice. Although, Jonathan, I would like to maybe peer a bit down this tunnel now that we're closer. You pointed out there is magic from a different beast.
Zariel Torgan 02:43:50 I don't know. Well, it's in the air, isn't it? There's three feet to get under.
Dungeon Master 02:43:51 Do you have Detect Magic up still? I believe it's Concentrated and Magic is on its pulse. So Detect Magic is off. Beyond that, the obvious problem is that you have a large Draconic creature blocking the pathway.
Leopold Magnus 02:43:56 Um, I think that was a concentration. Uh, okay. Got it. Uh, yeah. I think that it.
Kaladen Shash 02:44:18 It's great.
Dungeon Master 02:44:19 You could really hope that arcane snare holds long enough that the body doesn't drop on you. Sure. Okay, yeah, there's like three feet of space below this creature that you can peer underneath.
Leopold Magnus 02:44:26 The duration of the spell is eight hours. Yeah, OK. I'll take a look. I mean, that's enough for me to slide underneath there. Take a look.
Zariel Torgan 02:44:31 While he's doing that, can I run around and look for loot? Usually dragons have some sort of loot. Take a peek. Scan.
Kaladen Shash 02:44:51 Young Dragon, Vince Davis. Can I also engage in that search? Also a natural one, interesting. Interessante.
Dungeon Master 02:44:51 Go ahead and give me perception, investigation, whatever you'd like to make. Yes, go for it. Give me perception or investigation as you're looking up the tunnel as you crawl up. You guys don't find a single piece of traction.
Zariel Torgan 02:45:04 Natural one for an eight. Yes. Quite, quite, quite interesting. Nice.
Leopold Magnus 02:45:12 For me or. OK, for me. 19 total of 27.
Dungeon Master 02:45:26 27 April as you're making your way you clear underneath the dragon you're no longer under threat of being crushed and you're just sort of like slowly creeping up and you find that like 50 or so feet like there's no danger you're just slowly making your way you see the path becomes a little more compact it's a tight tunnel but you see that like there's a bracer on one side of the wall sort of like a support beam you get a little bit further and there's another support beam on the other side of the wall
Dungeon Master 02:45:56 You get a little bit further and there's like a whole doorway being set like one on each side and the cross beam on top for support.
Dungeon Master 02:46:04 And eventually you approach what you assume to be at this point, you maybe misinterpreted, not a creature that was magic source, you see an old arcane torch just sort of lowly giving off light, sort of flickering, long since abandoned, but marking a distantly explored tunnel and a sign back to the top maybe.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:29 GRRRRRR
Leopold Magnus 02:46:32 Ah, like it would go back to the surface. Got it, OK. I'll shimmy back underneath here. So that seems like it was, like, could I also poke around for treasure?
Dungeon Master 02:46:35 potentially go back to not the surface of like outside of the dome, but like potentially connect back up to a maintenance tunnel at some point. Yeah, you see that they're looking in like a magma pit for gold and they're not finding anything, but they're not sure why.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:58 We both died, so we're probably a little preoccupied. Jack, I'm down.
Kaladen Shash 02:47:01 Yeah, we're a little out of it. Can we short rest, guys? Yeah, and do we still hear stronger noise or presence down here in the bottom left?
Leopold Magnus 02:47:09 Yeah, I think that would be a good idea. And then look this place over a little bit more thoroughly. Yeah, it's too much.
Dungeon Master 02:47:22 You take a second, and you do still hear that constant thrum, that draw of energy. Leopold, give me an investigation for checking the chamber for loot. 13.
Kaladen Shash 02:47:30 Yeah, we should short rest and maybe poke our heads that way. That's what I want to do.
Leopold Magnus 02:47:41 OK. 13.
Zariel Torgan 02:47:46 Mm. Mm.
Dungeon Master 02:47:49 You're pretty thorough, more so than at least your compatriots, but you were also pretty certain there's no loot in this chamber?
Dungeon Master 02:48:01 Which you do find to be odd, as I think Zariel just makes an offhand comment as he's looking that, you know, dragons always have their horde looking for loot. And you know that that's like common lore and common mythology. Dragons haven't been seen in a very long time, obviously not in the Dome. But you don't see anything in here. There's a chance. It seems much too small for it, but
Leopold Magnus 02:48:22 Is there a chance that one of these other tunnels is also part of the Dragon Den? Could be, uh... Okay. So there's no obvious place it could be hiding its hoard.
Dungeon Master 02:48:31 um whatever's down there does seem to be giving off quite a presence and quite like a sound so not sure what it is but it could be nothing that you see this is also looking back at the dragon despite being substantially larger than you this is a young red dragon um
Zariel Torgan 02:48:46 Probably in one of these magma pits.
Dungeon Master 02:48:56 So like if scales aren't super worn and it's not like overgrown and it's horns usually you're like going through your like internal database of like bestial lore. Like a dragon's horns often indicate age and it doesn't have like a like a large rack of like multiple prongs like it's pretty small. Not a child. Not a wormling. It's just not a an adult.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:19 We just killed a child.
Kaladen Shash 02:49:19 Oh. Yeah, well, we're. Yeah. Can I? Can I pull some of his scales off and see if Ham Hawk can do some things with them? 18.
Leopold Magnus 02:49:20 Can I harvest some of its adolescent dragon? Yeah, that's what I was thinking, is gathering some resources.
Dungeon Master 02:49:27 Probably a couple hundred years old. Give me a survival check to see how many you get. Edeen, I'll say you get a small backbone, maybe like a couple pounds.
Kaladen Shash 02:49:55 Okay, cool, cool.
Leopold Magnus 02:49:57 Now, can I make a nature check to see if there's anything dragons are known for, like properties of their body, like maybe something that I could craft with? Or is it just the scales that are useful?
Dungeon Master 02:50:11 Chromatic dragons are widely known to be resistant to their affinity. So this dragon scales would provide some cover from fire damage. Their fangs and claws are hardened of their draconic race, so would technically count as magical against things that are resistances to non-magic weapons. But beyond that,
Dungeon Master 02:50:41 A dragon of this age hasn't developed a whole lot of magical capabilities. There's nothing beyond the basics. Yeah, same thing. Give me a survival check. You get one claw, and you get a broken claw. Two claws total, only one function.
Leopold Magnus 02:50:47 Got it. Can I try to harvest some of the claws? Nine. OK.
Dungeon Master 02:51:13 just takes a long time. It's not that like you can get more in theory, but like you guys, as you're taking this short rest, you notice Leopold is taking a very long time to harvest this claw. You're looking at him and you're like, your first thought is like that. That does not seem worth it. That is part of its skeletal structure that's going to be hard to come off. Anything else you'd like to accomplish on your short rest?
Kaladen Shash 02:51:32 it.
Leopold Magnus 02:51:33 Got it. I think I can rebuild my steel defender.
Zariel Torgan 02:51:48 I think I'm good.
Dungeon Master 02:52:01 If it is destroyed. Yeah, you will say like you could like reach into its mouth, like the corners of it's like jowls were like the armor plating has been crushed and pushed to the side, and you like take the pieces out being like yeah I could fix this.
Leopold Magnus 02:52:16 OK, let me see. If it is a died in the last hour, you're Smith's tools as an action. OK, so I'll use my last Bell slot to return my steel defender to life with all of his head points. And then is there.
Zariel Torgan 02:52:38 Nice. Nice.
Leopold Magnus 02:52:44 Like regain a spell. Oh, that's once per long rest. I will do a arcane recovery. And regain one on level one spell. So just basically get them back for free.
Dungeon Master 02:52:50 Nice combo. Yes, sorry, already rolled. Go ahead. Yeah, wasn't going to interrupt it.
Kaladen Shash 02:53:02 I will also use arcane recovery during the short rest. So we're going to roll it can roll hit dice for the rest on. OK. Good.
Zariel Torgan 02:53:12 Oh yeah, sorry, I just assumed. Nice.
Leopold Magnus 02:53:39 Mine go through. No, it didn't. I'll do 48.
Zariel Torgan 02:53:45 Nice.
Kaladen Shash 02:53:45 Great sweet 19 and 23 big rolls. Just about maxing out is perfect. Right.
Dungeon Master 02:53:46 roll. Important to remember, on a long rest you only get half of your head diced back. So if you use all of them, know that next session or whatever after this next long rest you're not going to get all of
Leopold Magnus 02:54:16 Interesting, I did not know that.
Dungeon Master 02:54:17 Good role. Okay, guys, complete your short rest. You have multiple directions ahead of you.
Zariel Torgan 02:54:20 Yeah, fantastic rolls. Way better than mine.
Dungeon Master 02:54:38 You guys can return to what you assume would take you to maintenance tunnels to the core and back, or you can sort of finish investigating this space down here.
Kaladen Shash 02:54:53 What shall we do? Oh, we're here. Yeah. Yes, let us move. Let us move forward. What is the source of this noise?
Zariel Torgan 02:54:53 I don't know about you, yeah I'd probably, I don't know. I'd probably rather check out what's down here but I don't know that we'll be able to get to it tonight, yeah. But I'm cool with whatever but I'd probably prefer to check it out. Yeah let's do it.
Dungeon Master 02:55:12 This will be quick if you guys want to check that out. You guys are at the end of whatever this trail is. I don't have the map for it. Because I didn't have time. So this will be a lot of the theater of the mind on this. But you guys, as you are going through this old dugout tunnel, partially established, you find...
Leopold Magnus 02:55:17 Yeah, so you.
Kaladen Shash 02:55:32 I would.
Dungeon Master 02:55:41 the thrumming gets louder and louder and eventually you see a faint purple light at the distant edge of like your vision. You keep moving forward and you come to this tall dugout cavern, not super wide,
Dungeon Master 02:56:00 As I build the room from out in, it'll make more sense. You've got the sort of cut into roughly chiseled walls, about 10 feet of walking space, and perfectly in the center, surrounded by very old, but maybe the most complex arcane machinery you've ever seen, bolted into the ground, clear tubing, this bright, steady,
Dungeon Master 02:56:28 powerful arcane beam projecting out of the ground from floor to ceiling, identical to the color of the beam that runs through the center of the core, identical to the color of the beam that shoots into the sky and feeds the dome. You guys have stumbled onto at least some section of the pure mono wellspring that like nourishes the dome, however deep into the ground you guys are. Nobody has been here in a very long time.
Kaladen Shash 02:56:42 Wow.
Dungeon Master 02:56:58 Machinery is not something you can even comprehend, it's so old. But you guys feel it feeding into your body. You almost feel like your curse is drawn to it, like there's parts of you that just want to push you towards it.
Zariel Torgan 02:57:19 Can I walk up and touch you with my hand? Charisma. Oh no. It's being charmed.
Kaladen Shash 02:57:24 Jump in. What's it going to do to you? Yes, I'm wearing my mask. No, I'm wearing my mask so I can extend the ability just on this saving throw of charisma to do it again.
Dungeon Master 02:57:28 Give me a charisma saving throw. Kyle, you can give him advantage if you would like. H.
Leopold Magnus 02:57:43 I'll stop there.
Zariel Torgan 02:57:53 8.
Kaladen Shash 02:57:53 She didn't help very much.
Dungeon Master 02:57:57 You guys see, you guys are like in awe of, I mean nobody, you certainly as in the Legionnaire do not have clearance to get this close to this beam. Something that like the entire city depends on. It feeds all of the arcane power, all of the arcane lights, everything in this city that thrives and is protected is because of this beam that you know to have been given to the world by the Elder God of Life, right? This is a huge discovery.
Dungeon Master 02:58:26 Zariel in its presence, the humming overtakes his ears, just the constant thrumming. You see almost his eyes kind of roll back as he's walking up and he puts his hand on the glass and like a, like a Jacob's ladder, the beam connects and the lightning sort of shocks through it. Without any sort of forced effort, Zariel, you take an additional stress point.
Zariel Torgan 02:58:54 Hmm. Interesting. Yes. The left. Although I did reach out with my right.
Kaladen Shash 02:58:55 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:58:57 That takes you to five, doesn't it? Which arm would Zariel care least about? Reached out with his rights.
Leopold Magnus 02:59:05 Jonathan, can I make it? I'm good.
Dungeon Master 02:59:23 You have, throughout these points you've taken, done them under certain conditions. Most of them have been to push yourself to a little bit of life. Just a little bit extra to persevere, to be there.
Dungeon Master 02:59:43 You put your right hand on this glass casing that surrounds the dome, not under your own will. You almost feel like you're forced by some ancient evil magic. You are compelled to go towards the Wellspring.
Dungeon Master 03:00:01 You touch the glass and shooting through your palm, up your wrist, your forearm, your bicep, through your shoulder, spreading over your chest. This purple light crackles like lightning burning through wood in jagged lines, spider webbing up your arm, thrumming purple.
Dungeon Master 03:00:19 the skin almost starts to melt away before coming back except it doesn't fully heal where the like energy is coursing through your vein system the skin completely burns away revealing just metallic musculature underneath and it sort of like sears it like it's not healable it looks permanent already like a scar that just of a purple coloration you can see through
Dungeon Master 03:00:50 permanently, you gain 1d6 extra hit points to your maximum. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 03:01:00 flirting with this thing, gave him some juice.
Zariel Torgan 03:01:00 Nice. Yeah, I was going to say that was a bummer.
Leopold Magnus 03:01:07 Yeah. Jonathan, can I make a pretty detailed arcana check to maybe record some notes, some observations, see if I can study this later? All right.
Dungeon Master 03:01:19 Just reroll that. Yeah, give me an arcana. Roll again. Ones don't count on any hit, though. Okay. Maximum hit point is permanently increased by five. Leopold with a 10. This is...
Zariel Torgan 03:01:35 Hey, there we go.
Leopold Magnus 03:01:38 Well, I didn't look very hard.
Dungeon Master 03:01:45 Beyond you I mean truly like you are a complicated work of machinery. This is like.
Dungeon Master 03:01:53 This is alien technology as far as you're concerned. You don't recognize any of this other than you can recognize like this is enchanted brass framing. This is some sort of acrylic glass cover that has been. It's got like a arcane webbing that goes through like the layers of glass to reinforce it. But like nothing about this is something you understand. Jesse as well.
Leopold Magnus 03:02:18 OK. So.
Dungeon Master 03:02:23 Once per day, you can heal somebody 1d6 by placing your right hand. Doing so will cause you 1d6 damage. Give me a charisma saving throw.
Zariel Torgan 03:02:32 Interesting. Oh, shit. Okay. Interesting. I'm going to touch the butt. Do I have advantage?
Kaladen Shash 03:02:38 Oh, great thing. And I can I also step up and touch the beam? Oh, that was almost a good score and then not at all. Oh, that'll do, that'll do.
Leopold Magnus 03:02:48 because they're a light in a rib.
Dungeon Master 03:02:59 You have advantage against charming effects. I'll go 20. You, you especially, you feel that inherent draw, like you almost, you can see it happening to yourself. Your eyes almost roll into the back of your head, but you pull them forward and you keep conscious.
Zariel Torgan 03:03:08 Natural 20.
Dungeon Master 03:03:29 Your hand goes up, but it's willing. It doesn't feel compelled. It's very cautious. And you feel a darkness sort of like behind you watching your actions. But you noticing it, you sense it fade immediately like it wasn't supposed to be noticed.
Dungeon Master 03:03:48 You place your hand on the glass and the same thing happens where the arcane pulse hits your hand and fills you with warmth. You take a stress point, but there's no damage to your body. You just feel this surge of magic, and I believe that just puts you at four. I will make note of that.
Kaladen Shash 03:04:06 which we have four.
Dungeon Master 03:04:29 Would you like to do anything else? Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 03:04:32 Yeah, is the toolbox still accessible? Zario, would you mind dropping the workshop down? I have an idea. I think I can jigger something up. I'm going to go down to the workshop, and what I'm going to try and do is remove one of the power cores from the night.
Zariel Torgan 03:04:37 Yeah, I could pull it out. Yeah, I'll drop it.
Leopold Magnus 03:04:57 And try and charge it up capture some of this juice. I kind of wire it up so that way there's two wires touching the Yeah, yeah, well is it possible I can remove one and try to super juice the cord
Dungeon Master 03:05:04 Maybe the trouble on that same thing as before the arcane sources in the night are still active. He is not dead He's just like in some sort of stasis and last time you tried to touch them. It did damage to you You're welcome to try it didn't it wasn't effective last time
Kaladen Shash 03:05:18 Yeah. Yes.
Leopold Magnus 03:05:29 All right, I'm going to try again. Yeah, I took a little damage. But I got to figure this one out. This is our content check. There we go, 25.
Zariel Torgan 03:05:32 Yeah, I think you tried to blow you up last time you did that, right?
Dungeon Master 03:05:42 You grab it and you feel a surge of power fill you as the arcane core goes to protect yourself. You were blown back and take 1d6 point of electric damage, but you were ejected into a memory. As you hit your head, you feel as like there's more to the core. There's a memory of you as a child sitting in front of a fireplace,
Dungeon Master 03:06:11 listening to a lecture from an elven man who sits there, just going, and Leopold, what is the best arcane defense against a foe shorter than four foot five? And you remember yourself giving an answer about Ice Knight because of its dexterity component, and then you hear next to you from your brother just goes, that's fucking shit. Stab him in the heart. He doesn't deserve his life.
Dungeon Master 03:06:41 And you see the figure gives a grim look to your brother, Victor, sitting next to you, always with the hint of bloodlust in his eyes. And then you are shunted out of the stream, holding the arcane core in your hand. Yes. And you see the arcane sources in the night dim a little bit.
Leopold Magnus 03:06:58 Awesome. That was a 1D6. OK. So I'm going to take it back up to the monosource that's powering the dome. And I'm going to try and kind of wire up some contacts to charge the power source, like a battery.
Dungeon Master 03:07:23 Give me an intelligence check. 8 you're looking for like context points, but. Building on like the alien nature of the machinery, there's not like.
Leopold Magnus 03:07:28 Intelligence. Oh, damn.
Zariel Torgan 03:07:35 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 03:07:45 uh like an outlet here there's not like a diverting source of like you are this is just like a surrounding beam of a cavern in a cavern that just like protects the singular beam of energy um you do notice that like holding the source closer to it seems to like make it a little bit brighter but you you just feel like you're charging the core as it was it's not doing extra effects you do notice as you approach
Dungeon Master 03:08:13 the the source itself you feel drawn to it there's an aspect of you that feels connected with it but as an arcane source nothing special seems to be happening like this other than like a source you have seems to be like fully charging back to like what it was
Leopold Magnus 03:08:25 Yeah, OK. So I'll hold the power source. OK. I'll hold the power source in both of my hands, kind of keeping two thumbs on it, and then touch the tip of my index fingers to this arcana source to hopefully conduct some of the electricity through myself or the magic power through myself and into the core.
Dungeon Master 03:08:51 Are you trying to get a little bit of this this magic in you? Are you trying to get a little bit of magic in you? Yeah. OK, give me a Christmas saving throw.
Leopold Magnus 03:08:55 I'm just touching it. I think Leopold is dedicated to trying to power this magic core. And if some of that is like the byproduct of that is him getting exposure, he's willing to take that. Where is my saving throw?
Zariel Torgan 03:09:00 Mm.
Leopold Magnus 03:09:26 Would I have advantage here? Oh, I see.
Dungeon Master 03:09:26 tent you guys watch and he can only do it once you watch as you kind of walk up and you place like the arcane source next to like the acrylic glass and it seems to like brighten and brighten then it hits a stability and you can feel a little from it knowing that you've charged this source and then you guys watched it like in the time that he sat there doing that suddenly like leopold's not moving anymore the batteries
Dungeon Master 03:09:56 fully charged as far as you can tell and you're just watching him and he's just standing there and then slowly like one of his arms goes slack with the source of it to his side and then he holds up his metallic gauntlet and he places it on the glass. You take one stress point.
Leopold Magnus 03:10:14 Okay. And do I get a charged power core? Can I put that in my inventory? Awesome.
Zariel Torgan 03:10:24 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:10:36 You do. Yeah. And then I feel like we want to, that's a pretty good stopping point.
Zariel Torgan 03:10:56 Yeah, it works for me.
Leopold Magnus 03:10:57 Yeah, that seems perfect.
Kaladen Shash 03:10:57 Yep. Good.
Dungeon Master 03:11:02 Awesome. Great session, guys. Great close to that. Above table, I can't even hold it in. Rex, I can't tell you what you just did, but there are going to be like, there's going to be some impact of removing that source from that night. That is, I did not foresee you doing that, but I understand why you did it, and I definitely set it up to be that way, but this is going to be interesting.
Leopold Magnus 03:11:29 We'll see. I mean, I can always put it back and have maybe something a little bit more there too. We'll see. I think it'll be helpful to have that in my back pocket. Nice. Yeah, I think it'll come in handy no matter the situation. We'll see.
Dungeon Master 03:11:39 The DC to the DC to remove that core was 25. And then are you planning on taking a long rest before returning or returning and then taking a long rest?
Kaladen Shash 03:11:44 Oh, rad. It just depends if we feel like we go through that doorway and we're in relatively safe corridors already. I'm fine just moving.
Zariel Torgan 03:12:03 I'm cool either way.
Leopold Magnus 03:12:07 I'm I'm spent spell wise so I can't really do much. But yeah.
Kaladen Shash 03:12:18 Or do we feel like we're going to engage?
Dungeon Master 03:12:19 You do notice this was a really, really hard place to get to. And you figure, like, you've taken time, you've taken a beat. The dragon was, like, the horde was this magical source. This is, like, this is, like, magic on the scale of, like, planets. This is divine world-feeding magic. This dragon, like, found this and, like, has made its lair to protect it.
Dungeon Master 03:12:48 So there's nothing that's been there in a while. So you don't think anything is going to be coming through here. So if you guys wanted to take a long rest, you would be leveling up. So you can get that done sooner than later. Or you can plan on moving to the core and taking a rest once you get back to your house, your bunks. OK, go ahead and take your benefit.
Kaladen Shash 03:12:59 Yeah, let's let's take. I'm OK long resting so that we can. Travel easily. Yeah, cool opener.
Zariel Torgan 03:13:07 Yeah, well, let's just do that. Yeah, and then that way we can take the. Sweet.
Leopold Magnus 03:13:12 Yeah. That's awesome. Well, good game to everyone.
Dungeon Master 03:13:16 because you will get the long rest. But we'll do a little dream stuff because of where you guys are at. But we'll do it next time. We'll start with that.
Zariel Torgan 03:13:36 All right, yeah, awesome, so next Tuesday?

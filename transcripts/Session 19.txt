Dungeon Master 00:00:03 Great. Alrighty. Just I love throwing it in there. Our last session started with you guys having just initiated combat with
Zariel Torgan 00:00:04 I don't think that'll ever not be funny.
Kaladen Shash 00:00:05 Thanks.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:07 He's got a serious pair of aviators on, he's chewing bubble gum, and he's ready to fly.
Dungeon Master 00:00:27 That venom troll and that like monstrous dog that it had um Through the battle. It seemed really harrowing. Um You guys were able to resist a lot of the poison effects due to innate abilities or granted through items um countered with just sort of the nasty damage addition total was pretty close, but um At one point it was noticed by I believe
Dungeon Master 00:00:56 Sauriel, but it could have been Leopold, forgive me if I'm wrong, I think it might have been Leopold actually, who noticed this sort of rabbit-like humanoid creature on the other side of the riverbank, who you later learn's name was Wesley. But partway through this battle, a large like monstrous centipede creature burst through the ground
Dungeon Master 00:01:20 seemed more focused on the troll and the other creature, but then quickly turned its attention on you. That fight also proving to be very hard. You guys came through it really successful. I love the way you did it. It was a lot of fun. But you took the night to rest. You inquired about what Wesley was doing, and then he sort of explained that he had been adventuring with his friends. He's from this small town called
Dungeon Master 00:01:49 Cottonwood, that most if not all of the people he knows are similar to him in some way, and so that you guys were sort of the odd ones out. But then he said that when they were adventuring for something, he woke up and they were gone. He tracked them to this deserted sort of temple.
Dungeon Master 00:02:09 buried and everything and he ran before anything happened so you guys caught him when he was fleeing and we kind of left off with you guys initially exploring you did speak with dead with this old rat like creature
Dungeon Master 00:02:27 Um, learning that one, it seems like the currency seems to be some sort of precious stones. Um, you know, there's a vault, which you then went to try to unlock, which resulted in the green cup riddle. You heard a loud noise and we ended it right there. So currently what happened is, you know, that there is access that is pulling Zariel towards this direction.
Dungeon Master 00:02:55 But you heard back around you somewhere, like right here, there was the sound of that door shifting down. What would you, the Odears, like to do? Yeah, you all drank it. And once you had all drank in of the green cup, you heard the noise. Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:03:08 Didn't we drink some of the cup? Okay. Right. The cup was underneath that door that got partially jammed up, right? Yep.
Kaladen Shash 00:03:14 Yeah. For your lightsaber through. That's good.
Zariel Torgan 00:03:20 And that includes Wesley, he did it too.
Dungeon Master 00:03:24 He did it right after Kaladin, who was the first. Yeah, underneath the door that you guys had to break your way through, well, you used your ability, I believe. Yeah, you used your Searing Saber. And it was on a pedestal, a bunch of different colors, in a very specific order.
Leopold Magnus 00:03:41 I did, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:03:50 Green, blue, purple, red, yellow, green at the top. It was shaped like a pentagon. But that has been dealt with. Was that a yes?
Zariel Torgan 00:03:59 Did you guys want to check out this area over here before we continued more towards where we think the final destination is? Yeah, well, let's head over there. I'll head up this way.
Kaladen Shash 00:04:07 Yes, I'm working with this. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:04:18 Yeah, I think I'm down. Was this sealed off? Is that?
Zariel Torgan 00:04:27 What can I see from? Oh. Empty. It doesn't look like there's anything here. So. What? I think it's where we came in.
Dungeon Master 00:04:31 I think there's an empty room. That's where you came from. That leads outside.
Kaladen Shash 00:04:46 That's where we came in.
Leopold Magnus 00:04:48 Oh, OK. Got it. Well, Kaladin, Zariel, shall we move on, maybe?
Zariel Torgan 00:04:59 Yeah, let's head down. Do we, do I get a feeling that the draw that I'm feeling, does it seem like it's also deeper along with the general direction? Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:05:13 Yeah, yeah, yeah, you had had that feeling that's like a. Like a draw that is pulling you towards a welcomed warmth. That is how you're you're sort of sensing it. It's drawing you that way deeper into the dungeon as far as you can tell. It's disconnected on this map, but going through that door right there leads you as you walk up and you turn the corner.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:29 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:05:40 there is this side room and you like turn the corner maybe right right as the door's finishing sort of sliding down and it goes level with the floor the final budget and you see scattered throughout the floor in old tattered bags that have long since been destroyed there are various like
Dungeon Master 00:06:01 gold pieces that are like hard nugget or they're not refined. You see uncut gems, some blues, some greens, some reds, some clear sparkling ones, like opalescent thunder eggs, like all these just various different like precious stones that you would just find in the ground. And it seems to be like what they were hoarding in here.
Zariel Torgan 00:06:29 Do we want to just throw them in the workshop? Yeah, I'll throw that on the ground, crack it open, and just start walking them down and putting them in a wooden box that we have or something. That way they don't roll around. Yeah, I'll do it real quick. Go ahead.
Kaladen Shash 00:06:31 Is that lootable? Throw him down in the workshop. I'll let the machines take care of this.
Dungeon Master 00:06:47 OK, yeah, love it. If somebody is going to document it and keep track of it. You have. OK, you have 200. Silver worth of nuggets. There is 400 gold worth of nuggets. There is.
Dungeon Master 00:07:08 2,000 gold worth of diamonds in small various forms, some bigger, some smaller though. There are 400 gold worth of sapphires and rubies combined. And then you can just write down roughly 300 gold worth of various stones, like thunder eggs, opalescence, just very pretty ones.
Kaladen Shash 00:07:15 Wow. Giddy up.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:38 Okay. That's not bad at all. Alright, I'm gonna put that stuff in, so give me a second, I gotta type some stuff if you guys want to keep cooking.
Dungeon Master 00:07:40 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:07:50 And then just for above table for a second, Zario, you've shared that you feel a draw to this place and that you continue to feel a draw as we continue deeper into the dungeon. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:02 Yeah, I think once I woke up after you guys, like, caught me walking away, I mentioned, like, oh, I just, I felt like a draw. I think, Jonathan, I did say that, right? Because I was asked for an explanation why I was walking. Okay, all right, yeah. So yeah, maybe I was a bit vague about it,
Dungeon Master 00:08:18 I think you like intentionally...
Zariel Torgan 00:08:35 Okay, yeah, I'll just say, as we move forward, you'll notice me kind of look, and I'll just be like, I feel like it's this way. I feel like it's this direction. Feels right. Yeah. All right. All right. I'll just add that stuff later, because I gotta like,
Kaladen Shash 00:08:49 Yes friend, if you say so. We're behind you.
Zariel Torgan 00:09:03 I can't see where to just add it as like a ruby. And so it's all right. I got it written down. I'll just do it later. Yeah, so Jonathan, do I feel the draw? Was it up here or down here? Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:09:07 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It's both. You feel like with a pole that it probably looks the same room.
Zariel Torgan 00:09:23 Ultimately, okay. All right. Well, let's try to be sneaky, I guess. Right? And then I'll just kind of start tiptoeing down. I'll go down the lower end of the map and see what I can see. Can I also
Dungeon Master 00:09:40 Okay. You turn this corner. Go ahead and everybody give me, if it's just Zaryl moving ahead, Zaryl, give me a stealth check. But if everybody's going with, give me a stealth check. Yeah, give me a perception check. Anybody who is listening, go for it.
Kaladen Shash 00:09:51 Yeah, I'll keep moving forward with them. Can I too do a perception check?
Zariel Torgan 00:09:54 Yeah, can I also just listen? If then I like just like... Okay. Mmm, ouch. Yeah, we don't notice much.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:08 Well, I think I better hang back here and maybe you could report up. You know, I'm not very stealthy.
Dungeon Master 00:10:27 No, but you do hear like slight droplet sounds, just like it's loud enough that it's picking up. And you do see that as you turn the corner, this room leads to, it's pretty open except for there is a large pool of water in the center. And then as you enter the room, you see there is a raised area like five to six feet up
Zariel Torgan 00:10:34 Hmm. Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:10:56 that leads to where you assume the other staircase was.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:03 Hmm. Hmm. Can. Hmm. No, no, no, you go. I'm just thinking. Sorry, go ahead.
Leopold Magnus 00:11:08 Go ahead. I was just saying, I rolled a five on my stealth check. So I'm just going to kind of wander into this room, chatting loudly to Zariel. What do you think this pool is all about? And then maybe I accidentally splash in it a little bit.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:31 I do love the idea of the super calm dripping and then it's just like whistling coming down.
Dungeon Master 00:11:31 Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:11:39 Yeah, just, hey there, Stetson. You make a lot of noise, but you find even just like waiting 10 seconds thinking you've screwed up, nothing happens. The sort of sound muffled over the water doesn't carry, so it lands pretty thud in the empty room. And you just sort of wait in silence, catching your breath, holding it, and nothing seems to happen.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:10 How deep does this water look? Well, maybe I'll dip my staff in there and see how deep it is. What do you guys think?
Dungeon Master 00:12:13 It gets dark instantly, so it's hard to tell. Nope.
Kaladen Shash 00:12:32 And we don't see any other exits from the room. Around the pool, this is it. No, I don't. I don't. Well, I don't think anyone rolled to know what it was.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:44 As a, as like a above table thing, did anybody roll to recognize what that hole was in the back of that guy's head? Does anybody know, or is that? Okay. Now, Jonathan,
Leopold Magnus 00:13:01 No, I definitely didn't.
Kaladen Shash 00:13:02 We just, we just knew that we saw the body with the hole, the skull in the hole. Oh, my character, no.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:12 you would know whether or not that's something that we could possibly know. We're pretty sheltered, being in a dome, being in a shelter. There's no chance we would know what that means, right? Okay, right. I figured as much. I just wanted to make sure we weren't just purposely missing something, trying not to metagame.
Dungeon Master 00:13:18 Mm-hmm. Yeah. You have not seen anything like this, no. And I might even have mentioned that this is nothing like you'd ever seen, so maybe I discouraged the rule right away. I don't remember exactly what I said, but yes.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:43 Okay, okay, that sounds familiar. Yeah, we're thinking it's something weird, some sort of torture device or something. Okay, all right, all right. Yeah, so if we don't see any other, can I see if I have the light cantrip? I don't think I do, because it's not super handy.
Dungeon Master 00:13:45 You do, like, that is not, it's like a clean, perfectly circular cut into the back of the head.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:11 Uh yeah can I just uh take out my my little quarter staff and just dip it into the water and uh about five feet long just see how how deep it is if it touches the bottom. Uh just right where my guy is just like walk up to the edge right here and just dip it in.
Dungeon Master 00:14:21 Where are you in like the pool in the location? You dip it in you do a couple little pokes like the first one right by the lip of the water. It's pretty shallow. You're thinking like.
Dungeon Master 00:14:38 12 inches or so, just like barely a foot, you get like ankle wet. And then you sort of move it a second poke, maybe a foot out into the right. And you notice it goes maybe a couple feet more, like there's a pretty sudden hole. And then you sort of maybe reach out just as far as you can. And the staff doesn't bottom out, your hands get to the water level before you feel anything.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:02 Does it read like stairs, or does it read like a natural slope? OK. So as a reminder, we don't
Dungeon Master 00:15:06 You move it around on the first couple ones and it feels like carved out, feels unnatural. Jagged, like it looked like this was once an actual pool still, but maybe like very decorative, something there. And it's like something has collapsed underneath, dug through at some point.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:29 This is a totally different thing than the other dome. This is a lost city on the way. Okay. Mm-hmm.
Kaladen Shash 00:15:36 This is an old ruin. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:15:36 This is yeah, you had seen like little pictures and murals of what looked like historical descriptions of like animal creatures sort of coming into fruition and they're like they transition from four legs to two legs like this is some old temple.
Dungeon Master 00:15:56 um yeah so it like sort of established that maybe a whole different history had sort of been experienced on the outer area or at least here that yeah it's totally different than the dome.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:09 We'll all relay the stair-step kind of stone carvings. Who all actually needs to breathe?
Kaladen Shash 00:16:22 just me and I've got we've got like a ton we have a ton of the rations.
Dungeon Master 00:16:24 Just talented. Wesley, who is standing next to you guys, types up, fellas, I'm not sure that I quite can breathe. Not sure how we want to approach this.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:44 Well, we have oh, go ahead. So we each have.
Leopold Magnus 00:16:45 Oh, you can't breathe right now. Is there something I need to do? And I go up behind and I go to do the Heimlich. Oh, dear. I thought he was having a medical emergency.
Kaladen Shash 00:16:54 Leopold, Leopold, take it easy. He's okay, Robert. Okay, he's okay. How many, what was, what was in my inventory?
Dungeon Master 00:16:55 No, no, no, don't squish me, George. Right, I can't breathe underwater.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:16 Oh, why didn't you just say so? Yeah, I thought we did get something that like a potion of water breathing. So everything.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:18 I think we each have two, don't we? Yeah, I have two in my inventory. I think we each got two.
Dungeon Master 00:17:32 You did because there was like a scrying of the last sort of area of the North Dome, Moonhaven, is like underwater is what the intel had told you. So the potions you got were to assist into getting into the city.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:55 Well, that might be an issue if we blow our potions now then, huh?
Dungeon Master 00:18:04 I will say you guys have not explored just how deep this is. You might not need it. Very smart.
Kaladen Shash 00:18:04 No, I can... I'll just cast Alter Self. Or do you wanna... Oh, there you go, yeah. There you go. Perfect, yeah. Scout. Go Scout.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:20 Well, hey, wait, why don't we just send one of us down there that can breathe and just see what it looks like and come back? Yeah, I'll poke my head down there and see what it looks like.
Leopold Magnus 00:18:35 Sounds good.
Dungeon Master 00:18:36 You're surprisingly heavy frame, sort of as you, like, go to submerge yourself expecting a little bit of float. You sink very rapidly, and you find that, you know, 15, 20 feet sort of down at an angle, pretty steep. It levels out pretty quickly, and you see that, like, it's pretty dark in here, but I believe you've got night vision. I mean, dark vision. That's a Warforged, or is that not correct?
Zariel Torgan 00:19:06 Yeah, I think so.
Dungeon Master 00:19:08 Yeah, so you see in just like the dull gray that it's like you get a little bit farther light underneath like the dark water. And you see that like probably 40 to 50 feet or so in like off directions in between like the rising seaweed that's sort of been growing the time. There is sort of an up to the tunnel, like it drastically goes up pretty quickly. So it doesn't look like it's like a terribly long time underwater.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:38 Can I see the surface up that way, or does it just go? I'll venture a little bit further. We have that mental link, right? Or you don't have the mask on, do you? OK, OK. OK, yeah, I'll just relay. I'll just say it looks like it.
Dungeon Master 00:19:42 Not from where you are unless you went forward. He's got it all.
Kaladen Shash 00:19:51 Yeah. No, I have a mask on. We're out of the dome. It's just on. Got my powers on all the time.
Zariel Torgan 00:20:03 Isn't that long? I'm gonna take a little bit further in, make sure. I think you guys will be able to swim this. And I wanna just move forward until I can see a definite surface. That way we don't get, you know, stuck doing something bad. 16.
Dungeon Master 00:20:18 Yeah, give me a perception check as you move through the water. 16. You don't notice anything in here. It doesn't seem inhabited. Just two in the dark. It's like probably artificial, so definitely like.
Dungeon Master 00:20:38 was put in here. But as you're walking through and you get to the end, you have a hard time just swimming, swimming. But it's not so steep that you can just push yourself up with the weightlessness of water and catch something to keep pushing yourself up. But eventually, you do find that it breaches a surface. And I'll move you guys to what you would see alone at this point.
Dungeon Master 00:21:12 But you sort of pick up around the corner and this isn't exact exact, but you do find that like it breaks up into this room where you see leads down. It's much more well kept and it looks. Way different in this area than in the area you were just in. Now what do you mean?
Zariel Torgan 00:21:32 This is going to be a huge map. I can tell by the way that it laid us out. This is going to be cool. Yeah, I think...
Kaladen Shash 00:21:36 What are you talking about? What are you talking about?
Leopold Magnus 00:21:38 Jonathan, anything else in that room with the pool? Yeah, anything around it or just with that pool? All right, yeah, I'll do that while we're waiting for him to swim around, just because we have time to kill.
Dungeon Master 00:21:43 Where you are, I don't see anything in this exact area. You can give me like an investigation check if you're just like really analyzing the room, but from where you were, you didn't see anything.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:00 Yeah, I'll poke my head up just enough to breach. I don't want to get out because I'm not the most quiet. Just to see that it's safe, and then I'll turn around and come back and grab everybody.
Dungeon Master 00:22:16 Ten, you don't see anything in this room.
Leopold Magnus 00:22:19 Yep, fair enough.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:28 Looks like it opens up into another area. Definitely different than this one, different stylistically. So I don't know what that means, but I think you guys could swim it. I indicate to the two breathers.
Leopold Magnus 00:22:47 Two breathers. Push forward.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:57 Is there anything you guys want to do before we head to the next map?
Kaladen Shash 00:23:04 No. That's the way we must go.
Dungeon Master 00:23:07 OK. You all jump into the water. Kaladin and Wesley, you find that you have to put a lot of effort into swimming through, whereas the other automatons, these mechanical beings, whether through their different means of enchantment in life, just sink down to the ground and walk across the floor.
Leopold Magnus 00:23:32 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:23:36 But they eventually lead you to that area. As everybody is passing through the water, go ahead and give me a perception check. Yeah, you're passing back to the area again.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:47 You want me to make another one? Okay. It's a little better.
Kaladen Shash 00:23:57 Thank you so much.
Dungeon Master 00:24:01 sorry you missed it the first time but you do see this time as you are moving through in the darkness you see there are more um like drawn images sculpted into like the wall of like some old forgotten mural um covered in like algae uh very dirty and your dark vision um can't like discern out and with enough detail what it is you just
Zariel Torgan 00:24:18 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:24:28 you rolled high enough that you sort of caught what you missed the first time. But you know pretty quickly, without any source of light, you cannot see what this is.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:40 I'll just kind of try to catch the bottom of Kaladin's foot or something and just kind of give it a little tug, just indicate to the wall, draw his attention to it, see if he has a means of, you know, lighting it up enough for us to see more. Oh, yeah. Hey, what do you think this is?
Kaladen Shash 00:24:57 You can speak to me, remember we've got our channel capacity. Do I see anything with my dark vision? Yep.
Dungeon Master 00:25:02 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:25:10 No, again, this is like Darkvision with the tones of grays that you see instead. And being absolutely like pitch black in here, you can't, while you can like make out general shape of the room and the filtering light from like the exit and entrance give enough of a sense of what it basically looks like, you cannot make the detail on the wall unless you like provide light at it.
Kaladen Shash 00:25:40 And I. Yeah, I can't cast light, but can I crack lightning lore? See if that sort of like gives a flash of light that's long enough.
Leopold Magnus 00:25:52 I guess, Ariel, did you say that on open comms? I think I might have something if that doesn't work.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:56 Yeah, just our shared link. Oh, go ahead.
Dungeon Master 00:26:05 Is there a verbal component to it? Verbal, then you cannot. Yeah, presumably.
Kaladen Shash 00:26:09 Oh, it's a cantrip, let's see. That's all it is, is verbal. Well, there you go.
Leopold Magnus 00:26:22 I was going to say, I think the saber would work underwater, right, Jonathan? So put off some light. So I'm going to unsheath my saber, activating it, and then try to hold it close to the wall there in the tunnel.
Dungeon Master 00:26:43 You ignite your plasma fire saver underneath the water. You see the water around it instantly boils. It gets so hot. And as you sort of push it forward, giving off all these bubbles and steam that gets absorbed by the water, you see a depiction very hastily done. It's old and sort of blackish, very faint on the wall. Almost gives a red hue with enough of the light
Dungeon Master 00:27:12 But it shows these very basic depictions of a bunny person and what looks like a bird person, but just very crudely and quickly done. But next to it, you see
Dungeon Master 00:27:28 in appearance of like much larger and some of them being like killed in the process, there are these monstrous beings with sort of like lines in squiggles depicted off of their face, very alien in appearance. And then below that you see circled a couple times, there is this picture drawing of like what looks like a crown sort of
Dungeon Master 00:27:54 Circle it for the head that has some sort of stone in the center. But nothing else is written. You look around the area, it's sort of just that. Very, again, appears to be very crude compared to any other artwork you had seen. Nope, just drawn and circled.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:14 Is the circlet that's depicted on someone's head, or is it? OK. Have we stumbled across anything that seems similar, like one of the stones in the vault? Does it have a similar shape or something, or is it just too crude to be that specific?
Dungeon Master 00:28:34 No, all the stones and stuff you had found, which you figure is the currency, and what looks like in the drawing is a polished, nice-looking head circlet.
Leopold Magnus 00:28:54 And so it's circled like the artist was trying to draw attention to that, or is it like circled as in it's the circle? OK. So it's pretty clear that they're drawing attention to that part of the drawing. Got it.
Dungeon Master 00:29:01 Yeah, like if you had an answer on a page, you would circle your answer. Yes.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:23 Well, I guess we gotta look out for one of these head thingies. And I guess I'll keep moving.
Dungeon Master 00:29:40 You guys go through the water all the way to the top, and you also emerge in this other section that looks big.
Dungeon Master 00:30:08 You notice the normal decay that you'd experienced earlier that sort of took down the temple look, made it very aged in look. Everything begins to transition into unnaturally smooth
Dungeon Master 00:30:23 almost as if the walls and floors have been melted and reshaped. You see strange patterns at sort of the end of the hallway as it gets deeper into it. Patterns emerge with spiraling organic grooves that give a faint pulse of a purple glow. You notice instantly as you sort of press yourselves up out of the water, the air feels much heavier in here. You almost feel like there's a weight on your body.
Dungeon Master 00:30:50 Zaria and I'm gonna say because you are all telepathically linked you all hear this Sorry, you didn't hear anything before it was just a feeling but as you push yourself up out of the liquid you hear a warm welcome, but whispered just And that pole feels so incredibly strong it's almost like a direct
Dungeon Master 00:31:19 connection to something.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:23 I'll just kind of shake my head because I don't know that everybody else heard this. I'll just be like, guys, I think we're meant to be coming here. This seems really good. I got a really good feeling about this. What? Oh, you heard it?
Kaladen Shash 00:31:41 Yes, what was that? We heard it too. That was someone speaking to you. Yes, yes. Yes, it's the first time you're hearing it.
Dungeon Master 00:31:50 Huh?
Zariel Torgan 00:31:51 Oh. Well, uh, didn't it sound nice? Well, I mean, it's coupled with this really nice feeling. I've been
Zariel Torgan 00:32:09 I don't know it's like this mixture of like intuition and you know positive reinforcement that's felt really good you know. That's the first time I've heard the voice but I don't know. Should be alright.
Kaladen Shash 00:32:23 Yes. Right.
Leopold Magnus 00:32:28 Well, I think, Zariel, you should tread carefully. It's a bit strange, don't you think, being called by some unknown presence?
Zariel Torgan 00:32:38 Yeah, well, I mean, I don't know, if it wasn't such a good feeling, I would think, you know, it would be malicious, but it's so upbeat and positive. Did I fail a check to get this, or did it just happen? I don't remember.
Dungeon Master 00:32:47 Point of order, reminder, none of you guys feel any sort of sense. You all made a check at some point that was never explained. And afterwards, you had a lingering sense of warmth.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:06 Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, okay. Interesting, interesting. I'm gonna try to say something back. So basically it just said welcome. Happy to be here.
Dungeon Master 00:33:28 Mm-hmm. You're hearing us somewhat excited, but again, still very whispery tone. We are family.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:38 What's your name? And you guys, you guys tear in that too.
Dungeon Master 00:34:03 Yes, it like hits your brain first and then there is like a slight lag before it is like communicated through the telepathic link.
Zariel Torgan 00:34:13 Hmm. So... Do... Well, not that I know of, but they seem awfully hospitable. If a bit vague, I would say, but... Hmm. So as a player, do I...
Kaladen Shash 00:34:19 Zaria, you have more family? You know more than machines? You're not telling us so?
Zariel Torgan 00:34:42 as a character? Do I am I like under a spell? Kind of like do I like feel like everything is okay with this? Or? Because like, even if I had like a good feeling about something, it doesn't mean that I'm just gonna like, keep trucking? Or do I do I just keep trucking?
Dungeon Master 00:35:01 Well, as a player, you would probably understand that you are under an effect of some kind. But as a character, you haven't made any inclination of wanting to resist. At no point have you stated there's discomfort with it or tried to break it or get it to go away.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:17 Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, well, it's all been good so far, so... Gotcha, gotcha. Well, I would have no reason to resist as a player, because so far it's been nothing but good. You know, it showed us the way, it showed us where that...
Dungeon Master 00:35:28 As a character, maybe not, but as a player, you haven't tried to resist if it and then you would probably be able to tell at that point for sure.
Kaladen Shash 00:35:31 Silence.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:46 Where that, uh, I guess I'll mention this, you know, it showed us where that stones were, you know, it's showing us along the way here. I mean, so far it's coming up pretty good. I don't know, what do you guys think? I'm pretty happy to just keep following to see where these people are.
Dungeon Master 00:35:59 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 00:36:09 Well, personally, I'm not so sure, Zariel. I'm a bit skeptical of their intentions.
Kaladen Shash 00:36:15 Let us proceed with caution.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:18 Oh, you guys. All right. Well, I'll talk to the guy again. All right, well, we're coming, but we're proceeding with caution. Nothing eerie there. All right, let's keep going. This is terrible.
Dungeon Master 00:36:31 We can't wait. This is fine. What are you talking about? You don't have to be so sick if you don't want to. If you want to talk about it for fun, you can.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:46 You know, this is one of the things, never mind, never mind, I won't say anything. I am excited. Yeah. No, no, no, I want to wait and see how you reveal it, because it's going to be a lot of fun.
Dungeon Master 00:37:03 As you guys move down the corridor, you see on the right, it seems to be an empty room. There is nothing significant about it. And then there seems to be two different pathways going straight ahead. And then sort of as you're walking on your left on the map, it's on the right there. Goes a little bit more this way.
Kaladen Shash 00:37:32 You said the air felt really heavy. Is there any sort of smell?
Dungeon Master 00:37:37 um like very musty like um like wet and it's been wet for too long as you guys make your way down this hallway um
Dungeon Master 00:37:54 The ruins that like have turned very smooth and worked almost begins to look like a grotesque mockery of what the original structure was. There are like stalactites and stalagmites of almost what looks like organic flesh-like material that protrude from the ceilings and the floors and it drips like a viscous bioluminescent slime as you keep looking down.
Kaladen Shash 00:38:19 it.
Dungeon Master 00:38:21 It almost like if you aren't focused at a certain area and looking through your periphery, the stone seems to breathe, expand and contract in subtle but unsettling ways. There's weird flora that clings to the walls, some spike, some bulbous, somewhat looks like a fungi of some kind, but it's very alien to the look.
Zariel Torgan 00:38:28 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:38:44 And as you are coming, is that Zariel who's leading? It's very dark. It's faintly lit here. But you do see movement on your left, just very off in the distance. How far would that be without revealing it? Almost 30 feet, but it's very dark at that point. Very localized leak here. No, like I said, that's an empty chamber.
Leopold Magnus 00:39:07 Is there anything in this chamber as we pass by? Got it.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:07 Hmm. Damn.
Kaladen Shash 00:39:14 As I come up to that hallway, can I see anything? My dark vision is 90 feet. Yep, not what I wanted to hear. Yep.
Dungeon Master 00:39:20 You see scurrying on the ground. There it is. Be mean. Walking on the ground with these like monstrous paws that sort of eject out of its body, this brain looking creature that is just at like a slow waddle moving
Dungeon Master 00:39:50 in your direction on the ground. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:54 Mmm. Guys, I feel really good about this place. This... yeah. Hmm?
Kaladen Shash 00:40:00 Zorio, you're mistaken. I'm going to fire a... I'm going to go ahead and... Can I take an action? I'm going to go ahead and shoot it with the esopteric blast.
Dungeon Master 00:40:20 Kaladin's pretty smart, so I'll give you this for free. It doesn't look aggressive. It is just like moving through a hallway. Does that change your decision? Okay. Roll to attack. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:40:35 No, not as not as the character. No, no, no, I mean, I mean, I'm sorry. Yes, as a character, I wouldn't, I guess I wouldn't react that way. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:36 Oh, shit. Oh, okay. As he points it out, can I see it or is it not close enough to where I can see it?
Dungeon Master 00:40:48 I was meant to have the intelligence to notice in an instant that it wasn't, like, viciously running at you. You see it? We'll say it's like...
Zariel Torgan 00:41:07 Hello, everyone.
Dungeon Master 00:41:09 It's moving towards you so it's coming into your life but as he holds up his hand you see it warps with this magical energy that he gives off and the magic as it forms in his hand is emitting into the dark space. So you have like a second before he fires off a blast to get like a peak of what it looks like.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:30 Do I still feel good about it, or would the unsettling nature of its visage change my tune? Or am I still like, this thing's great?
Dungeon Master 00:41:41 Give me... Sorry, okay, hold on. Brent, are you firing off the Esoptric Bluffs? I mean, you are Kaladin, so what do you want to do? Okay. We will give a chance on this, then.
Kaladen Shash 00:41:50 No, as a player, I mean, as me, I would. As Kaladin, as it doesn't look threatening. I just want to blast it away, but if Zaryl's super intent on reacting with it or engaging it.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:00 Just straight decks? Oh, Jesus.
Dungeon Master 00:42:12 Go ahead and roll me dexterity checks just against each other, like opposed initiative rolls almost. Just a check, not a save.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:32 Jesus, you got a plus 8? I rolled a 19 to get that 21.
Kaladen Shash 00:42:34 Yeah, came up short though. I know that's that's great, that's good. Oh, sorry that so that was a safe. That was a safe. Check would not still still in the matter. Yeah, still in the matter, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:42:41 right it was it was a check not a save it too so i don't think your check would be uh plus eight still lost it didn't change it too much yeah it would just be i13 instead right yeah um you go to raise your hand and you see that zorro you have enough time to do two things one if you would like to
Dungeon Master 00:43:07 Try to, like, essentially fight off the feeling to get a sense of if it's bad. You'll have time to do that if you'd like, but you also could stop Kaladin's hand. You could sort of, like, lower his hand before he fires anything off. You could do those two things in this moment.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:22 Yeah. Yeah, so I think part of me would want him to not hurt it because they've been nothing but kind and helpful. But as I see it and get better grasp of what it is, it's going to throw a little bit of doubt. So I'd like to put a hand on his hand, just kind of softly. And then, yeah, what do you want from me to... Jesus Christ. That's a plus zero, you know.
Dungeon Master 00:43:44 Give me a charisma saving throw. I did not know.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:54 All right. 19. Oh, man. Oh.
Kaladen Shash 00:43:59 Yeah, boy.
Dungeon Master 00:44:04 As soon as you get that seed of doubt, this is very unsightly looking. Like we'll say like even as it's like walking towards you, it sprouts like these gross tendril and dripping viscous wet like antenna out of the top of the brain, sort of like move around and sense. And you just get this overwhelming feeling of disgust. And then that warmth instantly snaps away in your brain. You don't hear anything. Like that, that sensation of like a connection is instantly broken.
Dungeon Master 00:44:35 and all you feel is the weight of the air in the room and the gross smell.
Zariel Torgan 00:44:43 take my hand off of his hand really fast, and I'm just gonna say, guys, this is really bad.
Leopold Magnus 00:44:55 Well, I'm finally glad you came around to the idea that the brain with legs is bad. That thing is creeping me the hell out.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:01 Wesley, do you know what this is? Have you seen this? Is this normal out here? Do you have any legends that talk about
Dungeon Master 00:45:16 You see Wesley shake and goes... I've never seen quite anything like that. Do you think something like that could take your friends though?
Zariel Torgan 00:45:17 It's like the opposite of Stephen Hawking. Just like a brain with legs.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:36 Perhaps.
Leopold Magnus 00:45:42 Just the praney.
Dungeon Master 00:45:50 Yes, they call him the Stephen Hawkingson of our lore. No, you see, he sort of scrambles a bit and he goes, I mean, there would always be stories of monsters that exist out in the wilderness. These are strange lands. But as far as anything I would know, the only creature who would be
Dungeon Master 00:46:19 strong enough to know what this is, let alone to have survived it, would probably be like the hag in the woods. She's the only one old enough to know what something like this is.
Kaladen Shash 00:46:19 It's fine. Does anybody think this looks like the thing in the mural we saw in the pool? Tentacles, alien thing, Wesley's people dying.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:34 is now that that's a that's different this is different is this thing coming towards us still like I mean obviously it's just like
Dungeon Master 00:46:54 Oh, yeah, as you guys are having this conversation, you see it like walks up and unless you do something to it, it like turns the corner in it and you don't hear anything now. It like turns the corner doesn't seem to like acknowledge you because it doesn't have eyeballs or anything. But you see it just like continues walking down this way before it turns off to the right and disappears in the darkness.
Kaladen Shash 00:47:20 That wasn't expected. Just walked right by, okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:47:22 Guys, I think that there's probably something pretty bad down here. Something was drawing me, speaking to me, and seemed to be luring us down here. I doubt it's friendly.
Leopold Magnus 00:47:58 Yes, I do suppose we should be very careful.
Kaladen Shash 00:47:58 OK. The thing in the dungeon is bad. OK. OK. Wesley, do you have any special ability to locate your friends?
Zariel Torgan 00:48:07 We'll.
Dungeon Master 00:48:19 No, not... I'm like a fair good tracker out in the woods, but that's just because I was raised doing that. My specialties are more of going around unnoticed, opening things that I'm not supposed to open. You know, all that jazz. Quite right, actually. No, one of my friends, though, he was very good at...
Zariel Torgan 00:48:36 Barbarian.
Dungeon Master 00:48:48 locating things. It was our best tracker we had. What was the last thing? Yeah, it's just like to describe it in a meta sense as you
Kaladen Shash 00:48:58 Okay, we don't see any evidence of like scuffling or it's very smooth stone. Like we just see really smooth stone. We don't see like any of them. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:49:18 go delve further in here it hits a certain level of just like continuously organic alien in appearance smooth melted sort of walls that everything gives off like a viscous slime um interesting point you see um like just repeated um like tracks of like these creatures moving around uh like just like thudded splats on the ground but like there would be it would be possible to do
Dungeon Master 00:49:47 like more of like tracking that you couldn't do in the earlier part of the dungeon with the worked stone like you had first noticed as he had described to you like drag marks from the differences of the prints of the party that had disappeared but like you think if you it'd be possible to pick up if they haven't already been stepped on in a race you could do a little bit better job locating here.
Kaladen Shash 00:49:58 Yeah. Yeah. Would that be some sort of like survival check or investigation check to see that?
Zariel Torgan 00:50:05 I'll do survival.
Dungeon Master 00:50:22 You could do either or. Survival would be an easier DC, but investigation is possible. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:50:33 will assist him. Sweet.
Zariel Torgan 00:50:36 Okay, yeah, do I get advantage on that? All right. Not great. Can I try talking to the voice again?
Dungeon Master 00:50:48 14, this area is thrown you off your element, and that encounter just now is really off-putting. You're just sort of off your game.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:06 Or, yeah, I'll just say we want to meet up straight or left.
Dungeon Master 00:51:27 You don't feel a connection. A general direction. From where you guys are, no.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:32 Before the connection dropped for this specific intersection, did I have an idea of a pole, like a general direction? Yeah, just because, like, I was still under the connection when I was at this crossroads.
Dungeon Master 00:51:55 Looking at the full map, I can tell you that it'd be about equal. No.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:01 Okay. Okay. Um, no, no, I don't know that.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:03 Jonathan. Go ahead. I'm just curious. I mean, this creature with the brain and slag is pretty perplexing. There's no way I would have ever seen anything like that in my life if I did like a history check. OK, so there's nothing I can get from that.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:26 Well, what do you guys think? You want to follow where it went? I mean it seemed to be almost walking in some sort of sentry type way. We follow the flow of traffic, maybe we're less likely to... yeah. Alright yeah, I guess we'll head down.
Kaladen Shash 00:52:40 Not much. Follow the flow. I'm okay with it. Let's see what happens.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:46 Okay, let's go onward.
Dungeon Master 00:52:59 Just checking something. Can I get my everything in order, you know? OK. You guys go down here, you see. In a dead end on one area, you see the two brain monstrous creatures are just sort of like like.
Dungeon Master 00:53:23 walking around each other in the corner. One just lays down a little bit. You see it goes off to the left as well, curves down. But from where you're standing, you also see the beginning of another room, just sort of like you get a cut at the corner.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:45 hmm
Kaladen Shash 00:53:47 Can I move up here and see what is down this hallway if I move a little further? The hallway continues pretty far this way. What do you want to do? Continue down? We see those brain things again.
Dungeon Master 00:53:59 You see it curves up. Let's do polygon.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:19 Hmm. Well, I mean, it's pretty much a toss-up. I'd be open. Maybe if I try thinking real hard, I'll see if it makes the brains move. I'm just going to think through a complex thought thing. I could do a mind puzzle and see if I can notice them change at all.
Dungeon Master 00:54:47 You don't get anything. You're putting a lot of effort in, but you, after like a lot of failed attempts, realize that you were under an effect that had granted you like the communication with these creatures and the intention to break it and succeeding, you no longer have any way to communicate with them as is. Unless you have some sort of class feature that allows you telepathic communication.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:49 Hmm. Interesting. Yeah, not that I know of. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:55:20 Yeah, I'm cool either way. What do you guys think? Yeah, let's check it out. There was nothing in this room. Okay. Yeah, I'll head up with Kaladin.
Kaladen Shash 00:55:25 Down into a small room perhaps?
Leopold Magnus 00:55:30 OK, well, let's move onward.
Dungeon Master 00:55:38 No, empty room. You see in this room a bunch of things. First and foremost, you see that the room is huge, large pillars,
Zariel Torgan 00:55:59 Oh shit.
Kaladen Shash 00:56:01 You're awesome. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:56:06 of like the stalactites and stalagmites have since converged, give off their own faint hue. It's like the vein work of this arcana pumps through like this purple energy. And in the middle of the room, you see this creature. Subtercane Mog.
Zariel Torgan 00:56:35 mhmhmhmhm
Kaladen Shash 00:56:37 Oh. Does this look like the creature in the mural?
Dungeon Master 00:56:40 floating in the middle. But you see that this does. This one is dressed up.
Dungeon Master 00:56:51 surprisingly fancy and it shows a high degree of intelligence in the way that it is dressed in like the mannerisms of its hands long claw like fingers bend to a sickly point it's got this like crested dome that goes way above its head it has ridges on the front very squid like as it's piercing yellow eyes seem to know you were there um
Dungeon Master 00:57:18 as it like is already looking your direction. Everybody in an instant roll initiative to see who acts first as it had been expecting you to turn the corner. Natural 20. Leopold, you have
Kaladen Shash 00:57:37 Man, get these low ones out of the way. Natural 20, all right.
Leopold Magnus 00:57:39 Oh, baby. Seems to me like it's it's gearing up to attack.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:42 Damn. We cookin'.
Dungeon Master 00:57:48 first action as you see this creature goes to raise its hand you don't hear anything yet um but as it like raises its hand what do you do it is doing yeah something in preparation of seeing you
Leopold Magnus 00:58:13 Okay. Um.
Dungeon Master 00:58:34 Okay, let me go find your Tinder.
Leopold Magnus 00:58:37 I'll move up and stand in front of the group. As an action, I will withdraw my Steel Defender. As a bonus action, I'll cast Magic Stone.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:50 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:59:02 Okay, action and bonus action, any movement out of you? Where on the map do you want your Steel Defender to go? Sorry, I'm going back to the map.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:06 Now just moving up and then kind of off to this left side, kind of trying to put line of sight between the creature and the pillar. And I will command the Steel Defender to move up and take cover.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:30 Um, I think it should be able to make it there if it's movement is. Yeah, like I'm going to try and talk it right up against this pillar.
Dungeon Master 00:59:41 You would have full HP at this point. Go for it. You have control over it.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:03 That's my term.
Dungeon Master 01:00:10 Awesome. After you, you see this, which you don't know, but I'm just going to call it what it is. This intellect devourer seems to turn and start moving into this space there, but doesn't do anything else. After that, this alien
Dungeon Master 01:00:41 illithid looking creature was in the process of casting telekinesis. You see it reaches forward and you see right underneath you and in slightly in front of Zariel, you see there is the stone door that is set into the ground at this time. And as the Mind Flayer goes, he casts telekinesis on the door and starts raising it up. I'm going to say it's going to take, um,
Dungeon Master 01:01:10 into the end of this round for this door to close. Kaladin, you will for sure have to make the decision to jump in or out. Zariel, it'll be in front of you, so unless you go in, you are considered out. But that is what it'll do on its turn. Kaladin, it is your turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:01:11 The.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:33 Want to move into the room. Well, smooth. It's not moving. There we go. Back again. And I will. Now I was looking at my looking at my.
Dungeon Master 01:01:55 I don't know if I lost the PC what he was going to do. Okay, I just wanted to make sure. Let's see if I can get a better slot for this.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:01 I could only see my. No, I could only see my second level, so I was like I don't want to see that. I'm going to use. I'm going to. I'm going to cast less because we're all within 30 feet of each other right now.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:27 Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:02:28 Okay. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:32 And the three of us, Wesley won't have the bump, but the three of us will have a 1D4 for attacks and saving throws. And then I'll use the rest of my movement to just kind of tuck in behind the pillar 25 more feet there.
Dungeon Master 01:03:05 OK. After that, Zariel, it is your turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:14 Alright, I'm going to step into the room, moving past the doorway. I'll go to... I'll go to right here. I'm going to use my action to cast Conjure Animals. And I'm going to summon 8 wolves.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:42 And let's see. And then, yeah, eight little wolves just appear around me, just sliding out from behind me. And I want, let's see what I've got for ruler here. How far away is everybody? 39 feet. What's their movement look like?
Dungeon Master 01:03:44 I hate this stuff.
Kaladen Shash 01:03:51 because of his little minions.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:14 40 feet, so they can make it. Okay, let me read the spell to make sure that they can go on my turn. They roll initiative when summoned, so do you want me to just roll as a group? Okay, so do you want me to roll that now?
Kaladen Shash 01:04:35 unit.
Dungeon Master 01:04:36 Yeah, they'll roll as like a package. They'll all go at the same time. Yes.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:44 I don't know what they add, let me check real quick. I'll roll the d20 and I'll check what they add. They have a plus 2 to deck, so that'd be 12.
Dungeon Master 01:05:06 Well. Cool, so they will go at the start before your turn next round. OK.
Zariel Torgan 01:05:14 Okay, all right, and then, let's see. Bonus action. That's all I got. Yeah, that's all I got.
Dungeon Master 01:05:38 You see after that turn, this Intellect Devourer up here at first goes to enter into the room and you see pointed at the Mind Flayer who makes a quick hand flick to right behind it and you see it instead goes and attacks Wesley who hadn't made it into the room yet. Although his initiative was 13.
Dungeon Master 01:06:06 He would have gone. I said he just didn't. He's too scared. He didn't know it was going to attack him. The other one didn't. So it turns around and it makes an attack on him. But it misses, you see, just like sort of jumps up and he catches it in his hands and he sort of pushes it back. And then after. It goes, you see he.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:10 Did he not get an attack of opportunity when that other one ran past him?
Dungeon Master 01:06:35 disengages as a bonus action and rushes into the room as the door shuts behind him, leaving this Intellect Devourer out of the door and no longer a problem. Start of the turn, Leopold, it is your go.
Zariel Torgan 01:06:44 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:54 I will, oh boy, what's this distance here? 35 feet to the mind flare. I'm gonna move my full movement to the, up to the mind flare. So five foot range on my weapon, right? So I should be able to still hit him.
Dungeon Master 01:07:23 Mm-hmm. OK, go ahead and roll it. 27 hits.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:25 I'm gonna take two attacks with my sword. Take this, you awful, wondrous beast! First sword, 27 to hit. That's good. It'd be hard if it didn't. Seven damage.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:36 We'd be screwed if it didn't.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:00 So 9 damage on that sword. Second one misses, 11 I'm assuming. Yeah, I'm getting in the fight. Leopold is evolving. Becoming more courageous.
Dungeon Master 01:08:10 Yeah, 11 misses. We will make a concentration check. It was always gonna.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:12 Damn, you ran right up to that guy. Damn. It's calling you out. I love that. That's so funny. No, I know, I know. It's just funny that it reminds you.
Dungeon Master 01:08:41 Again, no he does but I believe the five fails so he loses concentration on telekinesis. He is within
Leopold Magnus 01:08:41 Oh, I need to do a concentration check. Oh, I see. Oh, interesting, OK. I'll take it. So then with my bonus action, I will use one of my magic stones.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:49 Oh, no.
Dungeon Master 01:09:11 five feet, so you would have disadvantage on this. It still misses, yes. Okay, go ahead and roll to hit on that. 25 hits.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:13 Alright, 11 misses. With that is Leopold's turn, but the defender, I'll have him tuck out and attack with a Firebolt. 25 to hit. Oh, a nice guy.
Zariel Torgan 01:09:24 Nice. Damn.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:43 Ah, big hit. Steel Defender does more damage than Leopold. 17 on the fireball. Then I'll have him tuck back behind the pillar.
Dungeon Master 01:09:49 Okay. After that will be this intellect devour.
Kaladen Shash 01:09:51 Giddy up.
Dungeon Master 01:10:12 It'll choose, for sake of ease, just the very first wolf right in front of it, shortest distance. We'll see if it hits. 30, 20. I'm going to turn this to everyone. OK, it'll take.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:30 So I'll have shields. Yeah, that hits. Let me check the spell.
Dungeon Master 01:10:45 Six damage. And is this considered a real animal or spiritual? OK, cool. I'm going to say it's fine. I'm going to say it does not have a brain. Six damage.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:59 Um... Uh, it's a spirit. Okay. So six damage? Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:11:19 Okay, so that's wolf two. Okay, it is now the mind flare arcanist's turn. Having taken a surprising amount of damage in such a short amount of time, you hear telepathically in all of your brains, this creature goes to attack us in our own home.
Dungeon Master 01:11:48 And it will do a mind blast on a 60-foot cone, which hits everybody. I need you to all make a DC-15 intelligence saving throw. Yeah. Hits everything in a 60-foot cone. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:11:58 Okay, yeah, the mind blast travels through rock, stone, everything. Okay. You said intelligence saving throw?
Dungeon Master 01:12:18 That's a crazy amount.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:26 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:12:26 Plus 8 doesn't help you when you roll a 4.
Dungeon Master 01:12:37 Okay, what do we have? 24, 12, 17. This is a DC 15. So the only one that fails is Leopold. You all take 48 plus 4 psychic and it is only when you fail that you take
Kaladen Shash 01:12:50 because...
Dungeon Master 01:13:08 damage there's no half damage that is nuts okay so leopold you were the only one that takes this yeah
Zariel Torgan 01:13:12 Oh wow. Well, and you don't have a brain, so you're immune to psychic damage, right?
Leopold Magnus 01:13:23 I don't know if that's how that works. Jesus Christ. It's all the end of his next turn or?
Kaladen Shash 01:13:25 Excellent point. Excellent point, yes, yes.
Dungeon Master 01:13:36 You take 30 points of psychic damage and you are stunned. You are stunned for one minute. You can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. A creature can repeat it. So at the end of each of your turns, you can make that intelligence save.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:43 Oh shit. Feel the wrath of stun. You know how many times you stunned my monsters last campaign?
Leopold Magnus 01:14:04 Jeez, OK. I know, that's why I know it sucks. I'm like, fuck.
Kaladen Shash 01:14:05 Go past, go past. That's right, man. Maharb did a lot of stunning.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:15 Yeah, this is terrible. Oh shit, okay. Yeah, he did. Fuck. Oh shit. It's alright, you got a high AC. It's still possible.
Dungeon Master 01:14:22 Yeah, and then you see it for its action will walk up to you who are now stunned. It'll make an attack with advantage. You see it go to latch onto your head with its tentacles. Does 22.
Leopold Magnus 01:14:36 That's going to kill me. I can't I can't shield so. Yeah, I can't show some stunned.
Kaladen Shash 01:14:44 You got no brain. You got no brain. You can't get anything. What is he going to eat? There you go.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:46 Yeah he can't, he can't burrow it out. Fuckin' Jesus Christ. There's nothing I can do.
Dungeon Master 01:14:52 You cannot shield this 23-feature AC. Okay. You take... It's weird that all the damage is psychic. Normally you'd figure it'd be... Oh, second one doesn't count. It's just the first one. You take 14 points of psychic damage. And it has you grappled.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:23 Oh, the next attack is going to be the – well, never mind. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:15:25 extraction. You know where it's going. Let's just see how it goes. Yeah, let them dig around in there.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:29 But I got no brain, so you're absolutely right on that. Just licking the inside of a tuna can. Nothing there.
Dungeon Master 01:15:34 Let them know that. Kaladin, you see this gross display as you see it is like instantly incapacitates Leopold. You see his armor form freezes and then its tentacles wrap around the top of his helmet and his armor and he is doing nothing about it, which is your turn.
Kaladen Shash 01:15:57 I'm going to cast. Isopteric blast and then close the distance. So we'll see how many of these were roll for 17 hit. Trying 24 to hit. 2626 to hit.
Dungeon Master 01:16:07 Mm-hmm. 17 would hit, but it's going to use shield. Let me see what it started at. 24 hit, 26 hits. Four.
Kaladen Shash 01:16:32 First one hits for four. Second one hits for 11, so 11 paved, probably. Oh, you know what? You know what? Everyone is still blessed. My gosh, man. You probably could have made that save already. How terrible.
Dungeon Master 01:16:45 4 and 7 is 11. Let's see. Yeah, roll that d4. You need a 12, so you need a 3 or higher.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:58 Oh, wait. I think I had a 12, right? So I need a... That's probably good. I didn't need to retcon anything.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:59 Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
Kaladen Shash 01:17:03 How terrible? Three. Three or four, you gotta 50-50 here. No, it's OK. All right, all right. Remember, it's still there. Uh.
Dungeon Master 01:17:17 Everything continues as planned. Go ahead and roll. On the 17. Go ahead and roll a D4 to see maybe if you could hit. I'm not gonna tell you.
Kaladen Shash 01:17:35 What was your shield? What was the number? OK, OK. 19 to hit. Very good. Close the distance and take a. A tack with light splitter.
Dungeon Master 01:17:47 Doesn't change the effect. For those three blasts go off, you have the rest of your turn.
Kaladen Shash 01:18:06 No, I should have continued around for advantage. Greater, I guess he's stunned. It doesn't matter. The 26 to hit. Alright. It's. Uh.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:07 Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:18:13 Oh, the Mind Flayer is not stunned. Leopold is. Oh, but yeah, he'd still be here. He'd still get flanking on that. 26 hits.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:21 You know, Kaladin, if... Oh, never mind.
Kaladen Shash 01:18:39 Yeah, it's soft. I don't know why it's not showing you guys that. Yeah, it's nothing's, no number landed. Let me type it. I don't know why it doesn't let the button.
Dungeon Master 01:18:47 Taking forever to roll on mine. You just roll again, that's fine.
Kaladen Shash 01:19:12 We'll see.
Zariel Torgan 01:19:12 No. Not bad, though.
Dungeon Master 01:19:16 You do see that this creature is looking hurt like your slash visibly opens up part of like splits the skin on its head like a like what you see is like a thick white skin sort of as it splits on the purple aspect open fills with like a greenish blue blood starts to spew out and it goes down and tears its cloak a little bit. Pretty good damage on it so far it does look hurt.
Kaladen Shash 01:19:46 I'll just finish my turn by stepping to his side all the way.
Dungeon Master 01:19:50 OK. Azariel, your eight wolves go.
Zariel Torgan 01:19:56 Alright, so tell me what you think about this, and you can say no. The two wolf puppies that I've been training, I want them to come out and just watch how these guys work, and how I command them, and just use it as a training exercise.
Dungeon Master 01:20:21 Mm-hmm. I mean, it would take your entire action economy and movement to open up the workshop, climb in, wrangle up the pups, and then climb up the ladder to get them into position. But if you want to spend it doing that, you can.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:22 Is that okay? I don't want them to fight because they're too we. Let me pitch something different. I don't do that.
Kaladen Shash 01:20:47 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:48 Um, how many people can I fit around this guy? How many wolves? Like three, like six? So I'll just do, um, they each have 40 feet of movement. And so I'll, uh,
Dungeon Master 01:20:55 What would show on the map? You could probably do two up top, two up bottom, and something that could squeeze through. Two more.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:16 So around this guy with three, and then I'll just say this guy fits in somewhere on top. Is that okay that he gets like a nip in at a certain spot? Okay. So you're saying he can't or can? Okay, okay. Well, then I'll just leave him up here.
Dungeon Master 01:21:27 I'm going to say he can't fit. You've got seven attacks with advantage here. I'm going to say he can't fit now. Yep.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:42 And then we'll surround that one. So four on this guy and four on that guy. Is that okay? Okay. So we'll start off with the four attacks with advantage on the brain guy. These are all gonna be plus four, so I'll just roll eight times. Oh.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:04 Oh, that's going to be hard to see. So that's going to be 17, natural 20, two natural 20s, a 19, a 15, and a 13. So 20, 20, 19, 15 would be the four best. So that'd be 19 would be the lowest. So does a 19 hit? Okay, so four hits, two crits, and that's going to be 2d4 plus two.
Kaladen Shash 01:22:12 Giddy up.
Dungeon Master 01:22:20 Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. This is on the brain at the top, right? OK.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:34 Yeah, so 2d4 plus 2, so I'll just roll, that'd be 4d4 plus 4 for two of them, so that's 8d4 plus another 4d4 for the other two hits. So that'd be 12d4 plus 4, 8, 12, so 12d4 plus 12.
Dungeon Master 01:22:51 Mm-hmm. Completely eviscerated.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:59 So that's 26 plus 12, which is 38 piercing damage. All right. He's curious. All right, and I'll do the same thing. I'll roll eight of these for this guy. Not gonna be as good, just because, you know.
Zariel Torgan 01:23:26 Let's see, so 22, 21, 21, and 19. Okay, so three hits, so that's gonna be 64 plus six. All right, oh no, 64 plus... No, yeah, that's right, yeah, it's six plus six, so it's this plus six.
Dungeon Master 01:23:30 It, it, it, misses.
Zariel Torgan 01:23:56 So that's 22. And then he needs to make a DC 11 strength saving throw for the three that hit. To be not... Yeah, to be not knocked prone. Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:24:09 So three strength saving cards. First one is a 19. Second one is a two. And third one is a natural 20. Just need that two. Mm-hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:24:23 Oh. No one needs that too.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:27 All right, so he is knocked prone. And then, let's see. Oh, shit. Okay. That's it for them. I don't have anything else for them to do.
Dungeon Master 01:24:36 Ippold, you were also knocked prone. Okay. End of their turn. Correct. Yeah. Then it's your turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:58 Yeah, nothing else for them, yeah. All right. I really can't get in there to do anything. Do you think I could hit him with a thorn whip through everybody, or do I need to just wait?
Dungeon Master 01:25:23 Uh, if you made an attack with disadvantage and he'd get like half cover rules, but you could, you could, you could try like that's not a bad option. Yeah, go ahead.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:28 Okay, I'm gonna move up to right here. And Oh, actually, could I could I take my just my whole action to try to disengage Leopold from it's like tentacles just trying to like rip their faces apart. I'm not strong but
Dungeon Master 01:25:55 Give me a DC 15. This is supposed to be an intelligence save. That doesn't make sense if you're pulling it off. Give me like an athletics check against it. Depends on what it is.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:03 Could I try something? Well, I don't know. I was gonna want to hold my action and yell for Wesley to help me. And if the trigger would be if he decides to help me.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:32 then I do it with him and try to get advantage. And if he decides to do something else, I would just try it later. Because it's I don't have anything else on my turn. Just just this. Gotcha. Okay, so athletics to try to pull them apart.
Dungeon Master 01:26:42 Just so you don't change what you do on your turn, you don't think another, because you would be getting over here at this point, you don't think another creature could fit in and grab at this. There are way too many, like, character in the same space. Yeah. Just oppose athletics. He doesn't, he gets a plus zero to this, so it's a straight roll.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:02 Okay, and this is just a check. Okay. Ah, dammit. Alright, that's my turn. Actually, I'll throw a bonus, I'll throw a bonus action spell, uh, healing word. Uh, 2d4 plus 4.
Dungeon Master 01:27:12 But with a natural 18, you can't quite pry it off. OK.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:32 So that's gonna be eight, oh God, eight heals to you, Leopold.
Leopold Magnus 01:27:40 Ah, OK, thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:27:45 At the end of your turn, Wesley will just try to be the most helpful he can. So he, as a Hare creature, has a built-in mechanic for jumping high. So I'm going to say he can jump up and make a ranged spell attack against a creature that is laying down. So he will make the attack with disadvantage.
Dungeon Master 01:28:12 But since it's surrounded, it's advantaged, so it'll just be a straight throw. That is a natural 20. He's just going to steal all of your guys' Thunder.
Dungeon Master 01:28:36 He does, with sneak attack, 46 damage. He jumped up and threw one of his, you see this dagger sort of manifest in his hand every time he tries to throw, like he's got a built-in ranged weapon.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:43 We've been missing a rogue, dude.
Kaladen Shash 01:28:46 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:46 Wait, how did that happen? Is he just hiding? Wow.
Dungeon Master 01:28:59 And he throws it down. And this creature, which is incredibly hurt already, like being pulled apart by these wolves, latching on to like the last hope of taking down Leopold with it. This dagger just embeds directly in its body, but it's just like enough. And it was so close to death. It had one HP left. It had 23 HP and you did 22 on that turn.
Kaladen Shash 01:29:17 Raw.
Dungeon Master 01:29:22 In this creature, Leopold, you feel the tentacles as your, because at the end of your turn you would have made it anyway. As it hits your turn, you feel the grip on it relaxes as the creature goes limp. Since it's no longer grasping you, you're not under its effect.
Leopold Magnus 01:29:36 And I'm still stunned, though, right? Oh, dear. Oh, I'm feeling quite confused. What just happened? Oh, well, I just saw you guys and I thought I needed to defend you.
Kaladen Shash 01:29:50 Did great way to run in there. No thinking at all is great. You did well, it's OK.
Dungeon Master 01:30:02 You see in its clothing it doesn't. Again, this is what it looks like. It's got like these fine worked metal that's like part of its clothing.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:05 I think I'm going to sit down over here.
Zariel Torgan 01:30:13 Do we see anything on this thing's person? Can we loot it?
Dungeon Master 01:30:32 it's fitted to it doesn't look magic or anything it got pretty torn up it's got the tattered robes and stuff but maybe even uniquely you don't notice any sort of material belongings on this person no i mean if you were in the other room it was still remnant of
Zariel Torgan 01:30:48 Yeah, this is all like xenomorph tunnel light. Yeah, OK.
Kaladen Shash 01:30:49 Do we see any sort of murals on the walls, kind of like what we saw in the pool? Is there a large room? No, is it still? OK, this is still all fleshy. This is all fleshy. The pillars aren't there. It's just flesh and stuff. OK, go over. Right.
Dungeon Master 01:30:59 it being like a temple this is like some sort of yeah this isn't everything you've seen since you've got out of the water has been changed cool i'm gonna
Dungeon Master 01:31:19 Go eat some food real quick. We're going to take a quick break as you guys talk about what to do. I'm going to still be on the, I'll have my earphone in, so I'll hear you guys if you have a question. I'm going to mute for a little bit, talk to Hannah. Yeah. I will hear what you're planning unless you don't want me to, then I can just take it out. Do you guys have a preference? If you want to plan without me, you could do that. Are you sure? Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:31:26 Stay tuned in.
Leopold Magnus 01:31:29 So no talking shit, that's what I'm hearing. I think you're seeing like little stars floating around Leopold's head over here. He's not thinking very straight.
Zariel Torgan 01:31:31 Now go go for it
Kaladen Shash 01:31:54 Little stunned coming. Coming back to it. It only gives you like 1D4 though. What was it?
Zariel Torgan 01:31:59 Are you guys thinking we'll take a short rest or something, get some of your hit points back, or what are you thinking?
Leopold Magnus 01:32:08 Yeah, either that or I'll drink a potion here. Now, oh, I can also use the fork. I can use it three times a day. Yeah, I think it's a 1D6. It's something. OK. Yeah, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:32:26 There you go, that's OK, that could be that could be 18. If you need, if you need a short rest, you can. Like it's hit the ice pack like I don't. We we didn't lose anything, but it's it's not a. I don't think we're gonna take another short rest before we're done crawling today. Or two more.
Zariel Torgan 01:32:31 So I have... Yeah, I doubt it. Well, and if it was bad, and you don't get what you want out of the Short Rest, for a second level spell slot, I can cast Healing Spirit. And that's 5d6.
Leopold Magnus 01:32:43 Let's do that then. OK. I think I'll be fine on the short rest.
Kaladen Shash 01:33:00 Okay. Sit in front of it. Yeah, mind flayers. And then intellect devourers.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:02 So if we get to it and it's not great, then we'll just add that on. So does everybody else know? I mean, Bren, you should know now, obviously, what that was and what we're going into. Do you know, Rex?
Leopold Magnus 01:33:28 Yeah. Yeah, all I know is mind flayers are bad, bad guys. It can really mess you up. They got, yeah, the psionic intelligence stuff.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:39 All right. Gotcha. Yeah. Well, I don't want to ruin anything. It is going to be tough. Based on what we've already heard from Jonathan about how the thing spoke to us and how we talked about it as a group, it's been kind of explained that they're like a unit, that they talk as if they're one.
Kaladen Shash 01:34:01 Listening already. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:34:09 Um, and so that's pretty, that's already been established in game. Um, I think, uh, I don't know. It's going to be, yeah. So we get the impression that this thing was waiting for us. So we, we know that there's more to come and, uh, yeah, that'd be fun. This is gonna be, this is gonna be really tough.
Leopold Magnus 01:34:09 Right. The rest of them know we're coming.
Leopold Magnus 01:34:34 So I think presumably the site we saw in the cave was, we want to take that circlet. Seems to be like maybe a weakness or something, something important. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:34:49 Yeah, absolutely. I think I think we need to be on the lookout for some sort of like hidden room or like storage thing or Or something, you know, cuz cuz if they they're not dumb if they know that there's something that's gonna be like vulnerable make them vulnerable or Or hurt them, you know, they're not gonna just let you know, leave it laying around But
Leopold Magnus 01:35:16 Right. Yeah, I wonder if we if there's any way we could find a little alpha in this dungeon, you know, I mean, but it seems so so vacant.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:31 Well, I don't think we're even in the thick of it yet. I don't even think we're... Well, I don't know. No, we're on the periphery at best. You know what I'm low-key pretty excited about? That hag that he mentioned.
Kaladen Shash 01:35:38 I don't know what this as far back as that map started. I don't think we've touched much of it. Oh. Yeah, that's what he was dropping that, yeah? I don't think I've ever faced the hag.
Leopold Magnus 01:35:47 Oh, yeah. In the woods, yeah. Yeah, we're definitely gonna wanna follow up on that one. I'm gonna go get some water while he's gone.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:59 Yeah, he's just like, oh, by the way. Yeah, if we survive, we definitely need to check that out. All right, sounds good. I like that he left so we could plan and we're just chatting about fun stuff. I think they're only a minute.
Kaladen Shash 01:36:11 OK. It's it's really just continued on the hallway. How long do Wolfpack stay out? One minute OK. What was that? Was that a third level?
Zariel Torgan 01:36:28 Let me double check. This spell is so overpowered. Let me see... Uh, yeah. Let's see... Oh, lasts up to an hour. Damn. Yeah, they're just like, wandering around, peeing on stuff. You know what's really funny, is I talked to Jonathan about this spell, and uh...
Kaladen Shash 01:36:41 Third level, okay. There you go, they're just roaming with us. How did dinosaurs make it into five?
Zariel Torgan 01:36:58 There's another animal that I could have that's technically a beast in 5e and it's a velociraptor. And they have... I have no idea. I think that there's probably some book or something that, you know, has it as an option.
Kaladen Shash 01:37:16 There you go. Yeah. What? Oh my gosh. That's way over time.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:20 But I didn't feel great about that, because they're not really in his world, and I think the spell says that I'm familiar with. And so, you know, we decided against it. But they have, like, more HP, and they can do more damage per attack, and they can attack twice, and I would get eight of them. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:41 Yeah, they're like the most vicious, like, quarter-CR beast in the whole... so. These wolves are pretty sweet, though, too. If they hit, they knock people prone. Mm-hmm, yeah. So that's pretty handy. But... No, I got some other spells I haven't tried yet that I'm interested in.
Kaladen Shash 01:37:56 Yeah, the drag prone thing's pretty good. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:11 I know, uh... Let's see here. I've just been doing straight Druid spells, so I'm all the way up to 4th level. But I've only got one 4th level slot. Yeah. Mmm. I have a feeling that, uh, if we get to what... Oh, nice. That's huge.
Kaladen Shash 01:38:24 Okay, man, you're cruising. You got a lot of good stuff on lock. I need one more. Need one more level. Oh my, I'll get it. I'll get to second attack. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:44 I think, without giving too much away, because you already know what's coming, that what we're going to fight is one of the things that I really wished we would have gone back and messed with. It just didn't work out that way in the last campaign.
Kaladen Shash 01:38:59 Fun, OK, so yeah, you wish you could have implemented something similar to this mechanically or like this exact setup like feature wise. OK, yeah. Oh yeah, what was your? What was your first guy? What was your? Where's your barbarian orc? What's his name?
Zariel Torgan 01:39:08 Creature-wise, yeah, yeah. Because, I mean, you guys, you know, in a flashback, this is where you guys lost... What's his face? Now I'm going to forget his name. When you and Jonathan were... Yeah, his name is like Marvin or something, or...
Dungeon Master 01:39:20 Who knows what this means? This is not where we lost them. It was like our cleric companion. I have their notebook somewhere.
Kaladen Shash 01:39:34 Oh. No. Very good.
Zariel Torgan 01:39:41 Oh, OK. Well, anyway, this is one of the things that I really wished we would have got back to, but we never did. So I'm excited to follow up with it. Oh, you know, I probably have it on my page. I should just look it up. Let's see.
Dungeon Master 01:39:57 What was his name? Reindell. Yeah, glad to hear you guys are excited about this.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:12 Yeah, Braindell. Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Oh yeah, I didn't mention that. It's yeah, I I can't think of a practical way to make it work.
Dungeon Master 01:40:25 And for the record, I did tell Jesse that there would be, like, an opportunity to add velociraptors if he wanted to. You just encountered him now.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:43 But yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, I think it would be really funny to not tell you and just have it, you know. It's like playing to the apes out here.
Dungeon Master 01:40:55 It makes sense to have them in the dome, but from what you've seen in like this outer world, you don't know what sort of came about, rose fell, anything like that. It's entirely possible. Okay, so are you guys attempting to take a short rest, is that what I heard?
Zariel Torgan 01:41:23 Yeah. Yeah, we're resting. Or we're trying.
Dungeon Master 01:41:30 You guys. Don't get out of initiative yet. A couple rounds go by. But eventually. You see. Cresting around the corner. Into the room are two more intellective hours.
Kaladen Shash 01:41:49 you.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:57 I, uh, can I have my wolves try to take care of them while Leo rests? All right. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:42:06 Yeah. They are going to go ahead and your wolves are at 12 o'clock first. So the elected hours made it to there.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:23 So these guys get 40 feet, so they'll get to right about here. So I'll move this group up and get them ready. And then this group will go here and they'll tuck behind and surround. That one went off the map.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:53 Alright, they'll just focus fire on one and then go to the other depending. So that's going to be four attacks with advantage. So I'll roll eight. Okay, so that's really bad.
Dungeon Master 01:43:06 You just have to beat a 12 and then have over 21 damage and then they would just die. It's. It's. Love and Mrs.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:19 like really bad. So 19, 20, 13, and 11. Okay, so three hits. And then that's going to be 2d4 plus two on each of the hits. So that's 6d4 plus six. So that's 21.
Dungeon Master 01:43:49 First one is dead. OK, after their turn. Will be. So they went, it'll be. This one, I mean, it's going to do the only thing it can. It'll take a swipe at one of the wolf. Nine to hit.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:50 Okay, and that's their turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:20 Mrs.
Dungeon Master 01:44:23 OK. At the top of the round, it would be Leopold. Leopold, are you just taking a rest? Well, you'd be in the process of it. You haven't made it through the half hour to an hour that it would take to rest. Cool. Caledon, are you resting or are you participating? Cool.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:29 I took a short rest so. Yep, so I'll just be chilling. Take a little rest. Well, I guess could I have my defender attacking?
Kaladen Shash 01:44:45 I don't know. I can't participate. I only lost like... I don't know if I lost any of the points.
Dungeon Master 01:44:56 How long does, yeah, I mean, yeah, 100%. Well, actually, it wouldn't be able to get in. The wolves are in the place. So really, it just comes back to the wolves and their necks. And so Jesse just has to roll basically just to kill and it couldn't get out. So he's just kind of going to kill it regardless.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:00 Defender last night all day.
Kaladen Shash 01:45:15 Yes, we'll just let the wolves take care.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:21 Alright, better... no, worse. Does 11 hit? Alright, so I had a 12 and a 15, and the rest were less than 11.
Dungeon Master 01:45:30 11 misses. Hit. Hit. OK. Miss, miss. But then roll damage, and then it'll move past on its turn. So you'll get two attacks or four attacks of opportunity. That's insanely bad.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:50 Alright, so that's 8 damage, and then... That was some of the worst rolling I've ever seen. I rolled 8 DE20s, and only 2 of them were over 10. There we go, that's better. Yeah, natural 20, 20, 16, 15, 17, so all 4 of them hit. And then...
Kaladen Shash 01:45:51 Wow. 1 1 1 1.
Dungeon Master 01:46:14 I'll hit eviscerate it.
Zariel Torgan 01:46:19 One of them's a natural 20, so that's an extra 2. So that's going to be 10d4 plus 8. So that's going to be 33. All right. Just munching on brains.
Dungeon Master 01:46:46 And then, so everything goes quiet after that. The wolves take it out and they're sort of waiting, guarding the door. And you notice like six seconds go by, six more seconds go by, time continues to go by and you're not seeing any more come down this way. And eventually you do complete your short rest.
Zariel Torgan 01:47:14 Please. Well, how long in minutes was the short rest? OK, all right, so I got I still got my wolves for another half an hour. Well, what do you guys think you want to go deeper?
Dungeon Master 01:47:28 in minutes, 30 minutes. You, you're able to take your short break, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:47:45 I was gonna say, am I still resting? You waited for me?
Kaladen Shash 01:47:46 Yes, let us. Got it, we got it in. Yes, let us move further. I think we will see more of these people. These things. Leslie, are you good? You seemed very sneaky earlier. We like that.
Dungeon Master 01:48:10 Yeah, I mean, I'm fairly good at moving around, if you guys want me to take point. All right. You see, he's very weary of these giant wolves.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:17 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:48:29 Sneaks past and as you guys crest into this hallway you see that it connects all the way wrapped around and then you turn right and you see it just ends in a dead end down there with one, two different tunnels, one at the top, one at the bottom.
Dungeon Master 01:49:06 What are you guys doing? He's doing what? You see? And you have how much dark vision?
Zariel Torgan 01:49:11 Well, I'm cool. Either way, I mean... If I go up here, what do I see?
Zariel Torgan 01:49:39 You know, I don't know that I have darkvision. It's not showing on my senses.
Kaladen Shash 01:49:51 Yes, what is this?
Dungeon Master 01:49:54 Well then, you just see, before it gets too dark to see, it bridges off into two different parts. And then, Kaladin, you popped your head down there. As soon as you hit the bottom of that tunnel, you see it breaks into a couple different spots.
Kaladen Shash 01:50:22 Looks like it just branches down here. What's it like up there? Perhaps they all, perhaps they all meet up. Let me walk a little further. I kind of peek my head around the corner and not actually walking all the way into the hallway. What do I see moving up and down there?
Zariel Torgan 01:50:30 Pretty much the same. I'm not seeing as well as I could earlier, apparently. All right.
Dungeon Master 01:50:55 a dead end, some old, weird stalagmite sort of deformed into some sort of more artsy end piece, and then a hallway that goes down at the bottom.
Kaladen Shash 01:51:09 Guys, perhaps we check out up there first, this seems to be a different area.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:10 Yeah. Is there any natural light? You mentioned that there was, like, pulsating purple light from the walls. Is that what I can see? All right, yeah, I'll just kind of slowly start stepping forward.
Dungeon Master 01:51:22 Yeah, that's pretty much giving you your only vision in here. I'm more than willing to take a look ahead if you guys would like. I'm just not entirely sure of where to look for.
Kaladen Shash 01:51:44 Yes, Leslie, go ahead. Leslie, go ahead. To the top. Let me see what I see.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:45 Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, why not?
Dungeon Master 01:51:52 Which should I go up or down? I'm going to be honest, I can't super see well either. Seems as though I don't have adequate vision for this, but I can do it right sneakily. You see, he does very stealthily move forward, though.
Leopold Magnus 01:51:52 Everyone's like, yeah, please.
Zariel Torgan 01:52:22 it.
Dungeon Master 01:52:25 Not with those rules really. Dirty 20. Let's see what perception would be.
Dungeon Master 01:52:54 You see Wesley sort of comes up to the top here and he goes, um, not seeing a whole lot. Um, and then like get spooked and jumps a little bit, doesn't make a lot of sound by, um, this intellect devour that just comes trotting out of the darkness into the tunnel into view, moving past you. Uh, but then you all hear through the connection with Wesley that you, and that you all have your sort of telepathic link. You hear a voice,
Dungeon Master 01:53:24 from inside that room, just whisper in your mind, you get one chance to talk again, or we will annihilate you. He would see like a tiny bit further in.
Kaladen Shash 01:53:43 And Wesley doesn't see anything beyond where he's at. Do I see anything with where my token currently is?
Dungeon Master 01:53:52 But without dark vision, he also can't see anything. Yeah, you would see with your dark vision into that entire sort of sliver of the room. You see there is another intellect of our just sort of in the room walking around.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:20 So do we want to make a deal with this thing? Or do we want to? What do you guys think? Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:54:35 Difficult to say what's the deal and do we get Wesley's friends back do we go to go visit village like Well, we certainly took we took one, okay To ask Wesley or the or the voice
Leopold Magnus 01:54:47 Yeah, I think these are pretty bad news. Might be worth cleaning up, but do you think we could take him?
Zariel Torgan 01:54:55 Should we ask him? Yeah. The voice. Does the voice sound like the voice of the illithid that we saw or did it sound different when it spoke to us?
Kaladen Shash 01:55:07 Talk to him. That's what he says.
Dungeon Master 01:55:16 This one is very similar to the Elephant that you saw before it spoke, but it is not the same sort of lighthearted, cheerful tune that you had heard earlier. Different voices, I'll clarify.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:27 Oh, they're scared. Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. I'll say. What'd they say? We got one chance to talk before we're annihilated? Was that what it was? I don't know, what do you guys think? Oh.
Kaladen Shash 01:55:45 One, we have one chance. Let us. Go ahead, speak to them. See what they want. We don't have to say yes.
Dungeon Master 01:55:46 Yeah. You hear the voice goes. A creature smart enough
Zariel Torgan 01:55:57 Alright, yeah. Communication's a positive thing. What do you got?
Dungeon Master 01:56:16 to communicate before dying. And then you hear like a brief interruption. It's all in your brain, right? You don't see anything yet. And then you hear the cheerful tone come back as if something is overridden the dialogue. It goes, we just want you to join. Won't you be family?
Kaladen Shash 01:56:35 This is an easy question to answer, my friends, but we're assuming they can, like, they're understanding, like, are they reading our thoughts right now?
Zariel Torgan 01:56:38 Hmm. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:56:59 They like are responding in your thoughts, but it doesn't seem like anything is in your mind.
Kaladen Shash 01:57:06 OK. Do we do we keep this open so we can find them more quickly? Let them lead us in an attack. What do we? We clearly don't make deal with them.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:20 Yeah. Well, at the very least we could see what they have to offer. Well, boys, why don't you tell us the fastest way to get to you to join your family?
Dungeon Master 01:57:42 You see this mind flare hovers out from the darkness that you hadn't quite veered to vision. And you see its head sort of is completely blankets, tentacles hanging without movement. It still levitates in the air. You see these creatures, didn't notice before, don't actually touch the ground. They sort of float, suspended off the ground just a little bit, accounting for the lack of prints.
Dungeon Master 01:58:10 um and just the dragons from earlier and you see it it almost looks like it's not in control of itself at this point before that voice sort of comes back and it goes great follow us and you see the illithid sort of snaps back into itself and without a word begins to hover past and goes down the hall behind doesn't attack any of you
Zariel Torgan 01:58:36 What do you guys think?
Dungeon Master 01:58:40 If you let it by, it just keeps going. And then as it sort of gets, like as far as the thought and you're not following it instantly, you hear, come on, we'll show you. It's going up the direction you would come from, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:59:00 It's going up the hallway like we already passed where this their little center is. Yeah. Yeah, let's pick the one down there. It's let this let us follow. We have no idea. We just attack when we see it. Is that the plan you think?
Zariel Torgan 01:59:06 I'm guessing it's this way. The other way that we chose this. It was 50-50 when we saw these two. We just picked this one down here. Yeah. We'll just do this communication in our mind thing. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:59:30 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 01:59:36 We're walking through this dungeon with the hopes of finding whoever's in charge here to kill it. This thing's volunteering to lead us there. It's definitely not a trap of any kind. Alright, yeah, let's go.
Kaladen Shash 01:59:48 Sounds perfect, yes. No, not at all. Let us walk right to it. OK.
Leopold Magnus 02:00:04 Well, I suppose we're off to be family.
Dungeon Master 02:00:09 And as you guys pass by, we'll just reveal this bit by bit. What you notice instantly is as you all, in this large group, follow this mind flare silently through the hallways, you pass one intellective hour. And then as you get up into these rooms up here, I just want to discover, yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:00:34 You get into these rooms. Here you see there are more intellect devourers in the room. And as you pass them, going up this hall that you're being led down, you see every single one goes in tow behind you. So there's the mind flayer in front, your whole group, and then the intellect devourers sort of trail you as you move up this hallway. Mostly empty, you don't see anything.
Kaladen Shash 02:00:57 So it's like, it's like,
Zariel Torgan 02:01:01 Hmm. Is that shark coming with us?
Dungeon Master 02:01:08 That's just there, but that's funny. I was going to say, in that room, you see what looks to be like these cocoons that are partway open, almost look like sleeping quarters. No bedding or anything, but just like this place to like clutch into. And then if you guys keep following. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:01:34 Can I ask something? So the one clue that we've gotten throughout this whole thing is that there's some sort of like circlet or something. Now that we have the pressure off of a combat, can I, while we're walking through,
Dungeon Master 02:02:02 You can give me all anybody who's looking perception checks.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:03 cast my eyes over, as we're walking through, just trying to find any nooks or crannies, or just looking and seeing anything that seems out of the ordinary, that doesn't match the motif of this, to see if there's a place that that thing could be. All right.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:25 Perception check.
Leopold Magnus 02:02:29 I'll just, can I aid somebody or is that? Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:02:34 You see, as you're moving, it would make sense to be, like, aiding. You could do individual, but yeah, it wouldn't add up. 14, 5, 9. We'll see what Wesley gets. Maybe he can help.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:47 God damn it. He finds it.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:57 There is 14 You got a good per second
Dungeon Master 02:03:05 19 um you don't see anything like it doesn't this like you're like looking through and i think it would occur to you like you would the map doesn't do it justice in the sense that everything here the space that you're walking through has been like carved through like out of game the like the the psychic ability of the telekinetic ability of the the mind flares right
Leopold Magnus 02:03:05 Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:03:35 So this is all like it's not like something is hiding down here that was placed a long time ago. You don't know where this came from.
Kaladen Shash 02:03:35 Mm-hmm.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:46 Do you guys think that that circlet was back somewhere we didn't look on the previous map? I thought we checked every room. Hmm. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:03:56 Yeah, I don't think so. I it seems to me that maybe the the head mind flare might be wearing that circlet. You know, maybe that's something like there if we remove it. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:03:57 I think I don't. Yeah. I was going to say, I thought we cleared out because we walked back up to the only other spot. It was just a blank room. We didn't investigate that room. Yeah. I think we just have yet to find it yet. Break the, break the jam, do something.
Zariel Torgan 02:04:19 Okay. My history's dog shit. Oh, anybody, everybody. Okay, I'll do it. Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:04:19 Somebody give me a history check. Anybody? Anybody, everybody? 21, 21, 17. It's a plus here, but maybe he gets an at 20, you know?
Leopold Magnus 02:04:27 Oh, yeah, I'll do that. Hey, Colin and Eric. Yeah, we're on the same wavelength.
Kaladen Shash 02:04:28 Okay. Okay. Okay. Got those 21. Remember something. You're not you're not far behind.
Dungeon Master 02:04:50 Three, not at all. Your hair. Wesley goes, yeah, I mean, for sure, it's got to be down here, right? It's the only thing that makes sense is if it's in this one specific spot that's so convenient. And all of you guys are like in your head talking about this very hesitantly following. You are now sort of boxed in. And then you like remember back when you were entering into this,
Zariel Torgan 02:04:51 Hm. Hm.
Dungeon Master 02:05:16 temple to begin with, there had initially been two separate doorways that you saw that were spread by quite a distance. And you went towards the one that Wesley told you he had followed the track marks to, but there was another building.
Kaladen Shash 02:05:31 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:36 Is it too late to do we just tell them to take five and then we can get it and come back? The circle, it seems relevant to me, but I don't know. If you guys say go, I'll say go. I'll say we keep going.
Leopold Magnus 02:05:40 I think we're, I think we're family right now. I mean, I think it's relevant. We could kill this guy and backtrack.
Kaladen Shash 02:05:59 And you think it's in the other building? You feel like it's in the other building now? Your hard heart is telling you it's not. Many
Zariel Torgan 02:06:06 How far out of our way would that be, Jonathan?
Dungeon Master 02:06:11 I mean, it's out of where you are now through the water out of the other temple and then like across what I described is like the area of old decrepit buildings. So, you know, quite a distance but not like more than an hour. Yeah. I don't think that you think that.
Kaladen Shash 02:06:29 10 minutes of walking? An hour of walking, OK. We're going to engage. That's what's going to happen. We're already, look at this little duck line. Look at this herd of people walking down the hallway.
Zariel Torgan 02:06:34 Do you think that they would let us leave if we tried to leave? Like I said, I'm cool either way. I'll leave it up to you guys. All right, let's do it. We'll just keep cooking.
Kaladen Shash 02:07:00 to all tech.
Zariel Torgan 02:07:04 Yeah, let's do it. All right, yeah, we'll follow.
Dungeon Master 02:07:17 Okay, as you guys follow up, I'll add in them as you get there. But Mind Flayer leads you all the way up and through a tunnel, and then eventually, as I reveal it, leads you into this distinctly different room. There are, as you come in, you see up in these pods against the wall, you see through like this,
Dungeon Master 02:07:47 tinted green sort of glass-like material. You see figures in these things that are sealed off and in the room there are two more of these alien mind flare creatures tending to these paws and you see they're floating above this like gross briny
Dungeon Master 02:08:12 um liquid at their feet it's just like is also this putrid green color and as you guys have made your way all the way up to the top jesus there's so many of you do it all at once
Zariel Torgan 02:08:30 Do you want me to help move some wolves? Oh, nice.
Dungeon Master 02:08:44 Everything is together. There are a lot of entities in this map. Roughly where they are. If you don't want to be sandwiched in the wolves, put yourself ahead of them. Otherwise.
Kaladen Shash 02:08:52 you
Dungeon Master 02:09:13 You guys don't have to go in, but you've got all of these intellective hours behind you, and this illithid sort of breaches into this room, and as it floats to the center near these pods, turns at you expectantly, and in your head, you hear that voice reconnect through the illithid, just very innocent-sounding, but almost maliciously now at this point. It just says, come on.
Dungeon Master 02:09:41 Into the water. That's how you become family. You're so close.
Kaladen Shash 02:09:50 Yes, stay away from the water. Do not get close to the water, Leopold. Stay out of water. I don't want that. This is not how we want this to go. Obviously, that's all telepathic, but do we have a sense that this is where they wanted to lead us to?
Zariel Torgan 02:09:53 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:09:57 Well, I mean, I thought we were family here. I thought that looked nice.
Kaladen Shash 02:10:19 Just really see just the tunnel just keeps curving or whatever it does over there. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:10:24 Yeah and again there are three of these sort of like cocoon contraption like it is like alien technology that is it's advanced enough that you recognize it is a technology it's artificial but you've never seen anything like it right nothing in the dome matches this this is more akin to like
Zariel Torgan 02:10:46 There's three of us. I guess there's Wesley too.
Dungeon Master 02:10:47 closer to the sophistication of all of that technology that surrounded the beam, if anything. It's just like way beyond anything in the dome. But you can tell it's something. But you see there are three of these cocoons.
Kaladen Shash 02:10:54 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:10 I'll indicate to one of the wolves to go out and touch the water. All right, its perception is
Dungeon Master 02:11:22 as it walks in. I guess it can make a perception check with disadvantage because it's hard to see into the water, but nothing happens to it right away. Because it's basically incorporeal, right? It's not real.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:41 Yeah, it's Incorporeal. It's just got a plus one. I mean, it wouldn't be able to tell me anything, but it's a ten. Nothing happens to it, doesn't like explode when it touches the water. Alright, I'll have it come back. What do you guys think? Do you guys think we should just start killing them? I mean, we only need one of them to be alive to explain to us the next step if this isn't it, so...
Dungeon Master 02:11:52 Doesn't seem to get spooked or anything like that. Nope.
Kaladen Shash 02:11:58 Weird. It's. I'm I'm great with a group merge, let's just. There are contained. They're contained in a small space. They can do. Some sort of.
Zariel Torgan 02:12:17 All right, well, I'll have like burst.
Kaladen Shash 02:12:27 What did, what did they do? It's, well, they have their, we already saw it once. So, I mean, it's, it's already, it's already known that's that, yeah, that the exonic blast that they do, but they can also like, it's not teleport. I forget what they do. It's like a dimension door. So, I mean, they might be pretty mobile. They might be able to sneak away.
Leopold Magnus 02:12:36 Psionic.
Zariel Torgan 02:12:50 Well, I think I'm going to have the wolves start to trickle to the back as they let people scoot forward. And then that way they can... Yeah. And so I'd like, Leo, if you can step forward. I'll be like, Leo, in my mind, I'll be like, Leo, you want to move up? And I'll get these wolves to make a little blockade. And I'll put four of them here.
Kaladen Shash 02:12:57 Yeah, and still the wall. I love that.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:18 Maybe just three. And then three of them here. And then two of them. Maybe just one back on either side. And then, uh, do you guys wanna just start shooting shit in there? So anyways, I started blasting. Alright, well let's do it. I'll, uh...
Kaladen Shash 02:13:33 Love the way that sounds.
Leopold Magnus 02:13:36 Let's start blasting.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:48 Let's see. It's not me. I got a negative one.
Dungeon Master 02:13:48 I will ask just because what you guys do is not like normal thing to do in silence. I need as a group or if somebody wants to try to do it with advantage to try to sell it, I'm going to need like a performance check to see like that you're not giving your hand or that you're setting up actively to fight.
Kaladen Shash 02:14:15 Charisma at plus one or zero. Yeah, that's that wins.
Leopold Magnus 02:14:17 I mean, I think we've won. Don't I have the technically the best charisma? Yeah, my charisma for like a deception is a plus one. Yeah. OK.
Zariel Torgan 02:14:23 Yeah. Yeah, I'll assist him somehow. I don't know. I'll be like, yeah, you got it, Leo.
Leopold Magnus 02:14:44 Oh, I'm so excited to be family. I think it will be great. I can't wait. I'm going to start kind of skipping, actually. You're hearing all this rattling of my armor as I skip down this hall. My Deception Shrek. Oh. 18.
Zariel Torgan 02:14:55 I'm going to be like, he was an orphan, so he's earnest. Chicken's just falling out left and right. You also get advantage on that. If my help was enough to take advantage.
Kaladen Shash 02:14:59 To see you.
Dungeon Master 02:15:17 Let me roll to myself. Okay. Leopold, give me a wisdom saving throw.
Leopold Magnus 02:15:19 Oh. Yeah, I think the 18 is going to beat it. We'll see.
Leopold Magnus 02:15:47 Wisdom saving throw. Damn, they bit me there. Yeah, I don't think I saved that.
Dungeon Master 02:15:48 As with a 23, it sees that you are not being earnest about it. You see the one Mind Flayer who's sort of ahead of everybody, reaches its hand out, it curls its hand up so it's palm in the air, and then closes into a fist as it casts a spell on you.
Zariel Torgan 02:16:11 Oh. Counterspell. I don't. I'm just saying it. I'm very upset that I don't have it. I have the wrong class.
Dungeon Master 02:16:17 I don't know that you have that. I think you're just saying. Leopold, do you have any advantage against being charmed? Anything like that? Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:16:39 Just magical sleep. And a meaning to disease.
Dungeon Master 02:16:47 Your party mates don't know this, but I'm going to just say it directly to you so we don't have to go through something else to make it more difficult to play normally than it needs to be. You are dominated.
Kaladen Shash 02:16:56 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:17:02 For the duration, this creature is perceived as completely friendly to you. You'd share a telepathic link with it, as long as you're on the same plane of existence, and anything it wants you to do, you, as described, will do your best to obey the command.
Leopold Magnus 02:17:25 Got it. What's there want me to do?
Dungeon Master 02:17:25 It can give you simple, complicated ones. Um, and it doesn't necessarily make you, um, think what you're doing is right. Like if it asked you to attack your friends, you could like verbally say that you don't want to do it, but you are still compelled in that action, but you are dominated. And I need everybody to roll initiative. As you see these other two mind flayers are raising their hands to do the same thing.
Zariel Torgan 02:18:01 Now he gets a good initiative. I'll roll one for the wolves. Nine.
Dungeon Master 02:18:05 I'm going to say if the wolves go on one initiative, the intellect devourers will also go on one initiative.
Kaladen Shash 02:18:19 Yeah. It's okay. It's okay. Coming in, they'll sweep up the dirty.
Dungeon Master 02:18:35 OK, look at this. So we have 17, 13, 19 and 8. What did that wolves add to their initiative? So they have a 9. OK, first up is. This mine flare in the back.
Zariel Torgan 02:18:50 Just one.
Dungeon Master 02:19:05 You see it floats forward until it gets into view with Kaladin. I need you to give me a wisdom saving throw as well. Yeah. Unless you have advantage for something, but yeah, just a flat roll.
Kaladen Shash 02:19:14 Is this against? It's a stun. Strong, yeah, it's gonna win it. This is the flat roll. I've been I've been against being charmed. This is why I ask and it did no better or no natural ones.
Zariel Torgan 02:19:18 How long does Bless last? Oh, we took a short rest, didn't we? Okay. Oh! Oh no!
Dungeon Master 02:19:37 then you would have advantage on this. Kaladin, you are also dominated.
Kaladen Shash 02:19:45 This sandbag that gave her a from the spot. No. Great.
Leopold Magnus 02:19:46 Damn, dude. We're going to all be family now.
Zariel Torgan 02:19:52 Guys, I think this is the new campaign.
Dungeon Master 02:20:02 It on its turn also says, it doesn't request that you attack anybody, but it says in your head in this like more assertive deep voice just into the water. The start of the round is your turn.
Kaladen Shash 02:20:17 My turn. I can move 30 feet and get right to the water. Do I get to make any saving throw or anything against it, beginning, end of turn? What's that look like? It's gonna be beginning of turn.
Dungeon Master 02:20:38 Let's go with Dominate Monster. Dominate Monster. Each time the target takes damage, it makes the Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends. That is the only time it ends. It is a creature.
Zariel Torgan 02:20:48 Is it dominate person or dominate monster? Okay. Only. It's just a better.
Kaladen Shash 02:21:00 I'm not I'm not a mom. Well, I'm not a well. I'm not a monster. I'm a creature. Well. Like Dominate Beast. Oh, and. OK. All right, right, right. Damn, all right. Locked in. Here we go. Let me go ahead and just move right into that water.
Dungeon Master 02:21:12 Yeah, no, Dominate Monster works against the creature. It works against everything below it as well.
Zariel Torgan 02:21:17 Yeah, it's just a better dominate person. Oof. Where are you going? Wait, we had a plan.
Kaladen Shash 02:21:31 Just slow drift, just walking, just going. Hey Peter, just. All right. God damn it. I don't, I really, I just don't want to make it through this. I'm grappled.
Dungeon Master 02:21:44 As you step into the water, give me a dexterity saving throw. 10. Oh. You see, exploding from the water, you see this gross worm-like creature, almost teardrop in shape,
Zariel Torgan 02:21:48 Jesus Christ. I wonder what it's gonna be. Oh my god. Do you want to still be a wizard?
Kaladen Shash 02:22:02 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:22:13 with this mouth of a row of teeth in this ma as it like jumps up and like latches onto your body and it starts like with a little bit of spikes in its tail like worm movement crawling up your body. And it will make an attack. So if it lands two successful attacks, you will be forcefully infected with a parasite.
Kaladen Shash 02:22:38 And do I get to make on damage taking damage towards that when I get to make a saving throw? Alright, here we go. Here we go. Do some damage first tech. To hit. It doesn't.
Dungeon Master 02:22:43 So it will do damage and you can make a saving throw. Rolling it. Give me a chance. That is a nine.
Zariel Torgan 02:23:01 as I think this has gone really well. Ugh.
Dungeon Master 02:23:04 So it misses its first attack, and you see it's still trying to crawl up your body. It hasn't gotten towards a mouth, nose, or ear, or anything it can get access into. But at the end of your turn, Leopold, it is your turn. Give me a Dexterity saving throw.
Leopold Magnus 02:23:18 Well, here I go, gents. Into the weird pool with the strange worms. And I splash in. Natural 20.
Dungeon Master 02:23:35 Natural 20. I think it's more interesting to describe it as if you failed it, because it won't matter. But you are dominated, so you're moving into this space, and you just step and stand in the water. Your heavy foot falls, disrupting it. You see, exploding out of the water, this parasite jumps up and hits you in the head. And it tries to get into your armor and gets caught in the gears and mechanisms, the word, of give you
Zariel Torgan 02:23:38 Interesting.
Dungeon Master 02:24:03 power and it like is like crushed in the process. Being non-organic you cannot be sort of infected in this way. You are still dominated
Leopold Magnus 02:24:18 Interesting. Oh, dear. These things are crawling all over me, Kaladin. This is not my favorite.
Dungeon Master 02:24:34 but you will not be affected by these Mind Flayer parasites. And then that'll be the end of your turn. Since you technically avoided it, it doesn't get to attack you, so you don't take damage. Zariel, it is your turn.
Zariel Torgan 02:24:48 All right, I'm gonna have... The moment I turn that corner, they're gonna try to shoot me with their Dominator thing and I'm the only one that's not dominated. But I don't know that. So I am going to act as if I don't know that. I'm gonna move up.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:15 And let's see, I'll move to right here. And I'll go ahead and cast...
Zariel Torgan 02:25:43 Yeah, all right, I'm just gonna check something real quick. It's taking too long. All right, yeah, I'll step up into place and I will cast...
Zariel Torgan 02:26:08 I can't really cast any concentrations because then I'll lose the wolves. I'm going to go ahead and transform into my bear run up and try to attack this guy here.
Dungeon Master 02:26:32 Which guy? Which guy? Gotcha. Go ahead and roll your attacks.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:38 The first guy in the hallway. Right. Yeah. So it's going to be a bite and a claw. That's a 13 on the bite.
Dungeon Master 02:27:03 Misses. 15 would hit, but it'll shield. Okay. At the end of your turn, it is Wesley's go. You see Frantic, he looks and he knows what he has to do, so he will
Zariel Torgan 02:27:05 and a 15 on the claw. Okay. Yeah, that's my turn, that's all I got.
Dungeon Master 02:27:34 sprint in, slide underneath, just barely not getting into the water. You see he sort of skids in this, almost falling back, but corrects himself and he'll get behind the mind flare. And he will take his two attacks.
Dungeon Master 02:28:03 First one with advantage. 25 to hit. Yes. That'll be 28 damage.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:15 Nice. Is that the one that dominated Kaladin? Well, not necessarily. Yeah, he's got to beat a 14 or a 15 or something.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:28 So I mean, it's concentration is busted. Pretty high. 28, you said 28 damage, 14. Not bad.
Dungeon Master 02:28:32 Now he'll get to make a check. I gotta figure out which Mind Flayer that one is. Okay, that's that one. Okay, so he takes 28 points of damage.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:47 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:28:59 And he will have to make a DC 14 constitution save. And this is not a spell, so he doesn't get advantage or anything. But that is a natural 20.
Zariel Torgan 02:29:16 Interesting. It's alright, he gets another attack. Goddamn.
Kaladen Shash 02:29:23 You're just fine. That's a bummer. That's a bummer. Gay.
Dungeon Master 02:29:29 Second attack is a... 27, absolutely hits. No sneak attack on this one though. That'll be 10 more points of damage. Looking pretty hurt. End of his turn will be...
Dungeon Master 02:30:00 this guy's turn he is currently the one who is concentrating on controlling leopold so it will oh yeah dc10 hold on
Kaladen Shash 02:30:16 Okay. Keep grasping. Woof! Woof! Woof!
Zariel Torgan 02:30:17 Did he make a second concentration check from the second attack from Wesley? It should be easy. I'm just, you know, grasping at straws here.
Dungeon Master 02:30:34 Well, that's a 7, so that's a failure. Yadda, yadda, yadda. And it's got nothing to counter. Yes, a whole monster does drop on you. That is Kaladin. Yours is being held by a different thing.
Leopold Magnus 02:30:39 Nice. So, is that Kaladin or did I hear it dropped on me as well? Okay, I see, got it.
Kaladen Shash 02:30:46 All right, so cold monster drops on me.
Zariel Torgan 02:30:54 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:31:05 Well that one on its turn then will do something else because you are no longer in their group. This one will move in and it'll take its tentacle attack on you. Does a... ooh, probably not. 12 hit.
Kaladen Shash 02:31:32 No. It turns as it is.
Dungeon Master 02:31:34 Okay. Then it is the, it's going to be a doozy, the eight wolf signs. They can only go two wide. So if you're in the hallway, one can get next to you.
Zariel Torgan 02:31:41 All right, how many of them can fit in this hallway next to me on this side? Okay, so. Okay, so we'll put one there, and then the other ones will move up into position to be ready to do something next time, but they can't.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:07 Could I have a couple of these use their turn action and move and everything just to try to get past? Or is it completely blocked? I mean, I'm pretty big, so I'd be understanding if it's completely blocked. Okay, no worries. I'll take three attacks on one at a time moving forward from these guys down here. So that's going to be six d20s.
Dungeon Master 02:32:18 You are, you're yeah, you're being a bear. Nothing can get
Kaladen Shash 02:32:34 Hmm.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:37 I've got a natural 20, a 20, and a 18. Yeah, they get packed tactics, yeah. No.
Dungeon Master 02:32:46 I don't know which ones. Oh, because they just get packed tactics. Yeah, and nothing is under a 12 or under, right? Okay, so roll three sets of damage. If you're rolling just against one, again, your threshold is 21 HP. So if you do more than that, they're dead.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:05 Alright, so one of them was a crit, so it's gonna be 8d4 plus 6. I mean, sorry, plus 8. So it's this plus 8, so 30. Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:33:17 The wolves take one attack each, right? OK, so all of the attacks onto one of them, then. OK, so then, yeah, that's 30. So this Intellect of Hour is dead. This one right here. Let's see, add him to the combat tracker. And then he will take the remaining.
Kaladen Shash 02:33:43 Silence.
Dungeon Master 02:33:48 nine points of damage. 22 to hit, which one?
Zariel Torgan 02:33:50 All right, cool. And then this one didn't attack because it can't. And then I'm going to roll for this one real quick. On that guy up there. So that's going to be a 19. Oh, 22 to hit. This Mind Flayer up here.
Dungeon Master 02:34:16 Yes, that hits.
Zariel Torgan 02:34:17 Okay, so that's gonna be 2d4 plus 2. And he needs to make a dc... so 4. And he needs to make a dc11 strength check to not be knocked prone. And so does one of these guys down here. Or Cleave. Cleave maybe not. That makes sense, yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:34:41 I'm going to say cleave now, but he'll take the damage. Four, can he be knocked down? He can do levitate at will, but I'm going to say he still gets like flipped, but it'll be no extra movement to get up. But yeah, he'll be effectively proud. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:34:59 OK. That's it. Yeah, they can't do anything else, so.
Dungeon Master 02:35:09 Okay, after that will be, which one are you? This mind flare up there. Seeing how bad this is. I think it would know to do it for the greater good. You see, it just floats forward a little bit. Just no compassion in its eyes.
Kaladen Shash 02:35:37 It's going to blast us, buddy. Yeah. Let it rip.
Dungeon Master 02:35:40 He's going too fast, this buddy. Can get. Intelligence saving throw. It'll be Kaladin, Wesley, the Mind Flayer. It'll be Zariel.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:40 Oh no. Was that a intelligence or what was that? God damn it.
Dungeon Master 02:36:08 all four of those wolves, the steel defender, and one more wolf at the bottom. We'll all need to make the intelligence save. 19. 15 is the DC.
Zariel Torgan 02:36:15 Alright. Oh, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:36:15 Roger, Roger. 14, I don't think it was that, I think it was a 15 DC that was played last time.
Leopold Magnus 02:36:33 I don't see what the intelligence savings for on this Steel Defender is. I don't think it has an intelligence.
Dungeon Master 02:36:41 Then it'll just be an intelligence check if it's not proficient. DC 15. OK. So we'll get the steel defender in a second, but they will all take. It is 48. Plus four and you everybody who is affected by it who did not succeed takes.
Zariel Torgan 02:36:44 What was the DC? So all the wolves fail.
Kaladen Shash 02:36:56 What was it, 40? What was it, 48? What was it last time? It's gonna sting. Done. Balls. God, I'm out of this fight the whole game.
Dungeon Master 02:37:11 It is stunned for a minute. 17 points of damage and you are stunned.
Leopold Magnus 02:37:20 So yeah, I got a one for the still defender. So I think, yeah, it's done.
Kaladen Shash 02:37:23 OK, could have been could have been worse. Never OK. I know I'm gonna say a softball got lucky. It's just so it says it says blessed still up.
Zariel Torgan 02:37:27 Oh, absolutely. Last time it was like 30.
Dungeon Master 02:37:35 A 1. Okay, so it takes 17 points of psychic damage, if it can take psychic damage, and is stunned. But also, uh, Kaladin, you're concentrating on... something? Oh, so Bless is not up, so you don't have to make that check. Oh, and then I'll make one for the Mind Flayer. Hold up my end of that bargain.
Kaladen Shash 02:37:58 Yeah. Oh, it's on. There's no sculpting that shit. It's on. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:38:06 He's just checking to see if friendly fire is... is on. Ooh, eat it!
Dungeon Master 02:38:15 That was 7 plus 4, 11.
Zariel Torgan 02:38:57 The little goobers now. Looking to see if they even take psychic damage. Well, now we can.
Kaladen Shash 02:39:04 You're looking up a little. The take it. Yeah, just now. First thing up. Oh. I like your browser shutdown.
Dungeon Master 02:39:19 Can you guys hear me? Oh, I don't know why that thing closed. Okay. No, like I'm using my phone and for some reason Discord just shut out on my phone. Sorry, everybody took damage? Like, adjusted it? Okay, cool. So.
Zariel Torgan 02:39:28 Bye.
Kaladen Shash 02:39:40 17 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:39:47 That'll go away. Next up will be the intellect devourers. They don't get pack tactics, so it'll just be... They are small, so they can go forward. How much HP do they have?
Zariel Torgan 02:40:06 So you can delete these ones here. I'll move them all. Oh, 11. Yeah, they got killed by the psychic blast.
Dungeon Master 02:40:19 Oh. Didn't know they had that little. Um, thought they were just stunned. Okay. Um, there'll be one attack on the wolf at the top, two attacks at the wolf in the middle, and then one attack at the wolf at the bottom. So first attack. Uh, nine. I don't believe that hits.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:38 Miss. Yeah, Miss. Miss. Miss. Miss.
Kaladen Shash 02:40:40 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:40:49 Middle wolf gets attacked, that is a 12. Second attack is an 8. Last wolf gets attacked for a 10. Okay, can't do anything. After that, up at the top it is...
Dungeon Master 02:41:21 Which one are you? It keeps, it's not showing me. The really hurt one, okay. It is...
Dungeon Master 02:41:46 I think it's just it's known it's sort of getting sacrificed at this point. It's just going to try to get some brains out of. Wesley's an easier target out of Wesley. To see if you can get some hit points on that, that'll be. 25 which hits. That is.
Dungeon Master 02:42:17 20 damage and he is grappled and then Wesley must make a intelligence saving throw. 15, just makes it, meets it, beats it. Okay, after that Kalanit is your go.
Kaladen Shash 02:42:47 Stunned. Just laying there. Doing what I do. Intelligence. Okay. Okay. Out. I'll just wait around.
Dungeon Master 02:42:50 OK. At the end of your turn, you can repeat your save. If somebody does damage to you, yeah. Ouch. OK. Leopold, it is your turn.
Leopold Magnus 02:42:56 So I can only undo this domination via damage? Or if the... Yeah, okay.
Dungeon Master 02:43:18 It didn't give you any sort of input other than to step in, so you will just spend your turn getting attacked by the Parasite. And if it lands, 17 does not hit. Okay, Zariel, it is your go.
Zariel Torgan 02:43:42 Didn't Leo take that psychic blast damage, or did it miss him? Ah, damn it. Okay. Alright, yeah, I'm gonna take two attacks on this guy here. So two bear attacks. Alright, so it's gonna be with advantage, because I've got... what's-his-face there? It's gonna be 24.
Dungeon Master 02:43:47 It was it's ahead of him. He didn't take anything. 24 hits.
Leopold Magnus 02:43:48 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:44:12 And on the claws, that's going to be a 26. All right, that's going to be 8 piercing damage on the bite and 12 piercing damage, sorry, 12 slashing damage on the claws. So for... All right.
Kaladen Shash 02:44:14 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:44:18 26 hits. Sorry, I'll finish this Mind Flayer.
Zariel Torgan 02:44:41 I'm going to get that guy and then I'm going to run up and jump through the air for flavor. I know I can't really do anything this round. I want to jump to make an attack on this one here, but I can't do that. So I'm just going to just going to jump.
Dungeon Master 02:44:53 Okay. As you jump, up next would be Wesley, but he is stunned. So he will make an intelligence save. Doesn't make it, doesn't do anything his turn. After that, it is, we'll call him just Mind Flayer number two.
Dungeon Master 02:45:27 He's got three easy targets. He will throw out his psychic. Oh, I didn't mean to close that. I just totally closed my window, which is fine. He'll do his blast, though.
Dungeon Master 02:45:56 his Mind Blast is intelligence save on everybody all three well actually he can't get Leopold again it'll be Kaladin, Zariel in bear form, and Wesley.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:12 Oh, so lucky. So lucky on that. I've rolled unbelievably good. Ah, Jesus.
Kaladen Shash 02:46:21 and coming right underneath it again. So it's meant to be.
Dungeon Master 02:46:30 Wesley also fails with a 13. You all take 13 damage. You see Wesley goes unconscious and just falls.
Dungeon Master 02:46:50 into the water and you see this parasite jumps onto his body and on his turn will embed itself freely into him because he can no longer resist. He's not dead but you see he's no longer moving. It is this kind of flares
Zariel Torgan 02:47:06 That's not good.
Kaladen Shash 02:47:10 Sorry, sorry. Yes.
Dungeon Master 02:47:14 He will just walk this way to get advantage, and he will take a tentacle attack at you, at Kaladin. 25 to hit. You take
Dungeon Master 02:47:44 Nine psychic damage. I gotta just change this to everybody. So you can just see all of them. And then go ahead and give me an intelligence saving throw. 20, good. Okay, you are considered grappled, but you can break it on your turn. Well, you're still stunned from the previous thing, correct?
Kaladen Shash 02:47:59 Saved it. So I'm not stunned, I'm grappled currently. Yeah, but if I took damage and rolled another intelligence, or was that intelligence check for the current attack?
Dungeon Master 02:48:22 This was for that attack, but you did take damage, so go ahead and roll an intelligence save because of that too.
Zariel Torgan 02:48:24 Oh. Jesus Christ. Wait, don't you have a- Don't you have advantage on being- Oh, this is the stun- Oh. Gotcha. Okay, okay. Um.
Kaladen Shash 02:48:32 Oh. Oh, there we go. There's only 11 and it dropped over door for right now. It's OK still fulfilled fund. No, it's it's. Being. This is this is this site. Yes, the blast, not the being controlled. Yeah. Top one. So stunned and stunned grappled.
Dungeon Master 02:48:53 We'll get the dinky little attacks out of the way from. Yeah, they had a 12 on there. Correct?
Zariel Torgan 02:48:56 I think the wolves were supposed to go before these guys. It was a nine. It was a nine. It said 12 earlier, but... Okay. All right.
Kaladen Shash 02:49:03 Silence.
Dungeon Master 02:49:13 Nine. So it goes before one Mind Flayer but after the other one. So your wolves would get to go in between.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:26 I'll make six d20s, because they each get one attack. And we'll do the same thing we just did. God, that was so terrible. So that's going to be a 19, an 18, and a 13, and a 10. Okay, so three hits. So that's going to be six d6 plus six.
Dungeon Master 02:49:47 everything but the 10 hits. 20, you kill
Zariel Torgan 02:49:59 Sorry, 64 plus 6, not 66. 20. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:50:10 One more Mind Devourer and one more takes, uh, you said there's 20 damage? Eight more damage. No, these are the small creatures at the bottom.
Leopold Magnus 02:50:20 Are one of these the ones that have me dominated? Oh, I see.
Dungeon Master 02:50:38 They go on. OK, then it'll be their turn. But let me just. Yeah, he's not in town. Oh yeah, let him go after your turn. Go ahead and roll for him. He just said he's going now in the.
Zariel Torgan 02:50:38 And then that's it for them. Does the Steel Defender get to roll to break the stun? Just thinking about it.
Kaladen Shash 02:50:41 Okay, thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:50:54 Oh yeah, right. I should have done that maybe when I was after my turn. An intelligence check or... Oh God. Yeah, it's a minus three, so nine.
Dungeon Master 02:51:10 Intelligence saving throw. But yeah, since he's not proficient, it just presents as the intelligence check. Fails, still stunned. It'll deal, each wolf will get one attack, because there's only three of them. First one is a 22.
Zariel Torgan 02:51:16 Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:51:43 Clicking one is a 20. And then it is a 7. So two hits. So first wolf takes 9. Second one takes 6. And we already said that they don't get the intellect devour because they don't have brains. OK.
Zariel Torgan 02:51:49 Yeah. So there's both still up. One's got two hit points, the other one's got five.
Dungeon Master 02:52:13 Great, Kaladin, it is your turn. Intelligence save. Meets it deeply. You are no longer done.
Kaladen Shash 02:52:18 Grappled and stunned. I will just roll. Is it an intelligence check to break the stun? Yeah, save, sorry. Okay. All right, just grappled and in control of my body. Here we go.
Zariel Torgan 02:52:20 Oh, fuck. Hey. Nice. So can you make an attempt to break now?
Dungeon Master 02:52:44 I will say, yeah, technically at the end of your turn you make the save, but go ahead and you can try to make a grapple check. You've got to pose Athletics to try to break the grapple. It just has it as Intelligence to break it. So it'll be an Intelligence, another Intelligence save of 15 to break the grapple, which doesn't totally make sense, but Intelligence saving throw.
Kaladen Shash 02:52:55 You say athletics. I'm just rolling soft. That's OK. Still grappled.
Dungeon Master 02:53:16 Okay, still grappled. Leopold, it is your turn. Yeah, not getting hit either. We'll see if one of these guys can just land on you. Nat 20 to hit.
Leopold Magnus 02:53:23 I think I'm dominated, right? Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:53:41 Jesus.
Dungeon Master 02:53:48 You take five points of damage and go ahead and give me reroll your intelligence save to break your stun. Your dominate, sorry. 19 saves. So that would have happened. We can call it that the beginning of turn just to give you some play time. This thing jumps out of the water and it like
Leopold Magnus 02:53:57 Oh boy. Does 19 save? Well, hell yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:54:18 Again, trying to burrow into your brain to transform you hits a very necessary arcane wiring cord that goes from one of your cores to one of your extremities, and it shocks your body enough that you break this control on your essence, and you have your turn.
Leopold Magnus 02:54:38 Well, um, is, uh, is Wesley, is that worm really burrowed in there? Is that something I could prevent or. Okay. Um, I'm going to try to render aid to him. Bring it, bring them up. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:54:39 Cool. Right.
Dungeon Master 02:54:45 It hasn't attacked him on his turn yet, on his turn it'll happen, but he is unconscious in the water. Okay. With minimal damage you would be able to, like, crush these worms.
Leopold Magnus 02:55:06 Um, yeah, so I'll, I'll, uh, do that. And, uh, that way he wouldn't necessarily be, you know, inverted. Uh, Oh, like, uh, to, to give him a healing potion.
Dungeon Master 02:55:15 Okay. And then if you wanted to do, if you have any heels or anything like that, you could do that. Yeah, you could, if you want. You still have that kind of action to call.
Leopold Magnus 02:55:33 Yeah, I'll administer a potion of greater healing. 16 heals. Not bad. And so that was my action, right?
Dungeon Master 02:55:42 Okay. That'll be a 44 plus four. Okay. You see he stabilizes.
Kaladen Shash 02:55:50 All right.
Dungeon Master 02:56:03 Yeah, that'll be action. And we could call it free object interaction to crush the parasite. They're so small. So you've got a bonus if you have one.
Leopold Magnus 02:56:16 I think I still have two stones up from last fight. I only used one Seems like I'm fairly close to these guys right five feet Would I take an attack opportunity if I backed off of them? Yeah, oh I guess that's right they probably wouldn't still be flying around I
Zariel Torgan 02:56:22 I think it's forever.
Dungeon Master 02:56:32 You had the magic stones up from before their short rest. What's what's their duration? Is it an hour or a minute? Yeah, your stones are stones are gone. OK.
Leopold Magnus 02:56:46 Oh, it's only a minute. Yeah, only a minute. Okay, then as a bonus action, I will do the magic stones again. Bring those up. Would the defender get a chance to break that stun? Or is it stunned indefinitely?
Kaladen Shash 02:56:49 We're.
Dungeon Master 02:57:03 End of your turn is already your turn. No, so the Psychic Blast you can save from at the end of every turn, you are dominated. So at the end of your turn and then the end of the Steel Defender's turn, you can repeat the save. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:57:22 Okay, so we get a chance to save. I mean, I guess there's no way to become unstunned unless you pass this check. Is that what I'm getting? It's going to be tough. It's got a terrible, terrible intelligence. Uh, 11. Yeah, it's a, it's an 18 to break it.
Kaladen Shash 02:57:33 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:57:38 18. The loan fails. Well, yeah, you said it has a minus 3. The DC is 15. So you'd have to roll an 18 or higher. OK. Zara, it is your turn.
Leopold Magnus 02:57:49 Uh, okay. Okay. I was going to say, well, if it's an 18, it's not going to be. Yeah. Cool. Uh, that's, uh, that's it. That's all I got.
Zariel Torgan 02:58:04 Is this one Harry and Kaladin? All right, so I'm gonna go around here, try to get some advantage by flanking. Okay. I have these bear stats, so 12.
Dungeon Master 02:58:08 Yes. When you step into the water, give me a dexterity saving throw. 12 succeeds.
Kaladen Shash 02:58:31 Silence.
Zariel Torgan 02:58:36 Oh, cool. All right, so do I get advantage? Okay, so bite is gonna be a 23. And then claw is gonna be 26. All right, oh, I didn't mean to do that. All right, so it's gonna be
Dungeon Master 02:58:43 Uh, yeah. 23 hits. Both hit.
Zariel Torgan 02:59:08 Six piercing damage and... Jesus Christ. Eight slashing damage. Not good. Oh! I... oh.
Dungeon Master 02:59:13 And you were still grappled. Yeah. Yeah. It'd be, yeah, no, it's fine.
Kaladen Shash 02:59:18 Am I still grappled? Is there any sort of check for that? Are these taking damage? OK.
Zariel Torgan 02:59:28 Could I have instead just tried to break the grapples with my action rather than take attacks? I mean, it's a little bit much for retconning, but... Yeah, can I do that and make an ath... Uh, yeah, if I had known he was still, um... Yeah, so would that be bear athletics versus the... Alright. Plus five.
Dungeon Master 02:59:45 Parathletic against the plus zero for the Mind Flayer. 15. Yeah, you end the grapple, you bite through and you tear off one of its tentacles, releasing like a key point in the grip and Kaladin sort of pulls his head free.
Kaladen Shash 02:59:49 What's the bear athletics? That's great strength. They say it's good. Move.
Zariel Torgan 02:59:55 So 16 just to rip this thing off. All right yeah peel them off like a band-aid.
Dungeon Master 03:00:15 Hey, after that would be Wesley. You see, he uses half of his movement to get up on his arm. He is sort of really dizzy and his vision's blurring as he's taking so much damage. But you see, he sort of steals himself. You hear him whisper, he's like, I will not let them down. And he'll run up and he'll, because he's being harried, attack with advantage and just drive one of his psychic blades into its
Dungeon Master 03:00:45 Chest. That is... 23, which hits even with a shield. So he will do... 24 points of damage.
Zariel Torgan 03:01:06 Silence. Silence.
Dungeon Master 03:01:14 makes up for that one not taking damage last turn. Second attack is 17. It's shielded. 17 misses. OK.
Dungeon Master 03:01:44 It is then this fuck's turn. He's gonna roll to see if he gets his Psychic Blast back. You guys do not want this to be a 5 or a 6. It is a 4, he does not. Instead he will go after Leopold.
Kaladen Shash 03:01:56 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 03:02:05 Nice.
Dungeon Master 03:02:15 to give Kaladin a break and he'll do his tentacle attack on you. That is a 17 to hit. Misses. Up next is the three remaining wolves.
Leopold Magnus 03:02:23 Mrs.
Zariel Torgan 03:02:31 Alright, so yeah. Again, another six. 21, 17, and 11. Okay, so just two attacks. That's going to be 4d4 plus four.
Dungeon Master 03:02:51 Everything but the 11 hits. 12 points of damage to the one that's already kind of hurt or any of the remaining. Okay, you see it is incredibly hurt.
Kaladen Shash 03:03:01 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 03:03:02 Uh, 12. The one that's kind of hurt. Okay.
Dungeon Master 03:03:21 After that will be this dickhead right here. He will see if he gets his mind blast back. Same deal. 101 through a four. He gets a six. He will take the attack of opportunity from both
Kaladen Shash 03:03:37 Got it back. Blast his buddy.
Zariel Torgan 03:03:39 Mm-hmm. Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm. Mm. Hmph.
Dungeon Master 03:03:50 Wesley and Kaladin to circle to the other side of Zariel. So go ahead and both of you take your attacks of opportunity. Well, I guess one of them is me. Would be at advantage at that point still, because he would be blanked at that point. If Wesley, he only rolled a 15, that misses.
Kaladen Shash 03:04:21 26 hit. Or 24 or whatever. Yeah. There you go, still has a nice roll. 21.
Dungeon Master 03:04:24 26 hit. So go ahead and roll your damage. This guy has not been hit yet. Oh.
Zariel Torgan 03:04:44 Nice.
Dungeon Master 03:04:51 This guy has been hit, I'm sorry, this one has been hit. So that makes him look really bad actually. He is like a third of his health. Okay, everybody go ahead and give me that health save. One fail.
Kaladen Shash 03:05:04 All right, pass this intelligence check. Here we go. Going to get a 14. Here we go. Sneaking over the bar.
Zariel Torgan 03:05:16 Nope, fail. Nice. Nice. Yeah. Fuck him.
Dungeon Master 03:05:22 16 passes. And Leopold, what you got? Mind Flayer fails. Leopold just passes.
Leopold Magnus 03:05:30 I see. Oh, 15.
Kaladen Shash 03:05:40 Yes! Take some damage, Mind Flayer! Get stunned! Get stunned! Yes! Yes! Mind Flayer's a cutthroat. Great.
Zariel Torgan 03:05:52 Yeah, they ain't fucking around.
Dungeon Master 03:05:53 So, Zario, oh, Wesley has to make it too. Wesley passes it. So, Zario, you take 21 points of damage and you are stunned. This other Mind Flayer takes damage for the first time, and it is stunned.
Dungeon Master 03:06:22 And that'll be the Intellect Devourer's turn. They'll take their three little... little tiny bitch hits. First one, eight. Second one, seven. Third one, 12. Okay, all three missed. To the top.
Kaladen Shash 03:06:38 It's so soft. That's great. Well, maybe. All right. Dexterity.
Zariel Torgan 03:06:44 Uh, AC 13. They have better AC than the bear. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:06:52 Caledon really that's well the bear is huge that makes sense. The one below Zario. Go for it.
Kaladen Shash 03:07:05 I'm going to use my bonus action to use this object blast at this mine player. On the far side of. Yep. I should open. Else 18 miss so first one misses.
Dungeon Master 03:07:24 He had his turn already, so he has his reaction back, so you're going to go for an AC of 20 with his shield.
Kaladen Shash 03:07:36 22 hits. And 15 misses, so one hits. First six damage. And then I'm gonna just turn around and take an attack with advantage on this one that is stunned right now, right? Just stunned. Does it hit if he's just stunned?
Dungeon Master 03:07:58 Mm-hmm. Uh, you advantage on the attack, and if you hit, uh, he is not... Hold on, let me read, because if it says he is incapacitated, it is a crit, but if he is just stunned, it is just advantage. It is just stunned. It automatically fails strength and dexterity saving throws, attacks against it have advantage.
Kaladen Shash 03:08:14 So 28 to hit. 16 damage.
Dungeon Master 03:08:34 16. That is no joke. That is this guy right here. Takes him to that right there. Okay. Anything else? Okay. You see a little parasite goes jumping in front of you and misses as you step out. Leopold, it is your turn.
Kaladen Shash 03:08:48 No, I'm going to just because the other guys just stunned incapacity. I'm going to just take a few feet to step out of the water. Yes.
Leopold Magnus 03:09:07 I'm going to take a swing of my sword on this mine flyer right here next to me. 24 on the first strike.
Dungeon Master 03:09:15 Roll with advantage. 24 heads.
Zariel Torgan 03:09:16 Nice. Good moves, you guys.
Kaladen Shash 03:09:30 So.
Leopold Magnus 03:09:36 Hey, 17 damage with that slash. And then the second one, oh, damn it. 18 to hit. Yeah. Figured. I will then back up a few feet.
Dungeon Master 03:09:46 Okay. 18 chest misses. Okay. I think with your stone damage, it's possible to kill him.
Leopold Magnus 03:10:04 and launch a stone as a bonus action. Let's see. He's stunned, right? So then this one would roll with advantage, and it's a nat 20.
Dungeon Master 03:10:19 done but yeah it's done awesome uh range attacks i don't believe have advantage but since the first roll is the 20 it's still an end i think it is melee attacks that have advantage
Kaladen Shash 03:10:20 Brown. It's great.
Leopold Magnus 03:10:36 Oh, okay. I didn't know that. Uh, my bad. Uh, wait a second. Oh, okay. So yeah, it's, uh, it just doubled the rolls. Okay. 15 damage on that stone zinging out.
Zariel Torgan 03:10:39 Bye.
Dungeon Master 03:10:52 No, it is at all attacks. Yeah, but we do double all the damage, so instead of plus 5, it's plus 10, so we do 15 damage. Not dead, but incredibly hurt. Hit save.
Leopold Magnus 03:11:10 And then I guess my Steel Defender will roll for the save. No, negative one, not gonna happen. Yeah, it's my Street of Intelligence. Yeah, it's real tough. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:11:21 Nate, not going to happen. Sorry, let us see you work out.
Kaladen Shash 03:11:21 He's got a minus three. That's your end. I guess that's. That's the whole point. He just waits for commands, you know, just. Yes.
Zariel Torgan 03:11:33 Yeah, I'm gonna let's see this guy over here is still Stunned right I'm gonna step over here and take an attack of opportunity to chomp on him
Dungeon Master 03:12:01 Okay, this one will take his tentacle attack at you then. Natural one, it misses. That was his reaction. He is stunned, so he can't shield, so 15 hits.
Zariel Torgan 03:12:12 All right, so... Jesus Christ. 15 to hit with advantage. Oh, shit! And that's a natural 20 on the second one.
Kaladen Shash 03:12:14 That was your, and that was the reaction? Okay. Okay. Yahtzee?
Dungeon Master 03:12:32 You might not need it. You might want to save your nat 20 for the other one. So no damage yet. Go ahead and roll your crit damage for the blobs.
Zariel Torgan 03:12:37 Okay, alright, so that's gonna be 7 bite damage. Alright, so that's 4d6 plus 10. Decent. That's gonna be 29 damage.
Dungeon Master 03:13:03 Sario, how do you want to finish both of them?
Kaladen Shash 03:13:03 Got to be good.
Zariel Torgan 03:13:06 All right, so as we all know, this bear walks on two feet. He's going to pick up his paws and waddle through the water, narrowly escaping a tentacle. He's going to grab this guy, and he's going to rip his tentacles off of his head and just bisect him. And he's going to take half of this mind flayer, and he's going to throw it at the other one and just squish it.
Leopold Magnus 03:13:13 And we're just proud of you.
Zariel Torgan 03:13:36 I don't think I have a bonus action, but I will get out of the water. I'll go over here.
Dungeon Master 03:13:44 Okay. Epically finishing it and destroying it. Both of them are dead. Anything else bonus action wise? Okay.
Dungeon Master 03:14:08 At the end of your turn, Wesley will take his turn. Run out of the water as well. He's got his built-in hop, so he jumps over you. He will take an attack at this Intellect Devourer. He'll go for the hurt one, but it will have partial cover. So it'll have an AC of 15 instead of an AC of 12.
Dungeon Master 03:14:40 13 misses. Unfortunately, the jump is a little too unstable. The wolves are right in the way and the dagger goes flying high. It hits the wall behind before dissipating and reappearing in his hand. It is your wolf's turn.
Zariel Torgan 03:14:56 All right. Natural 20 and 13. I can't see what this one is. OK, so two of them hit, so that's going to be 66. Sorry, 64 plus 6.
Dungeon Master 03:15:14 13 hits. How much damage?
Zariel Torgan 03:15:32 So that's going to be 18 damage. 18.
Dungeon Master 03:15:41 Okay, you completely kill one, and that'll be 17 damage to one of the other ones. You've got one perfectly healthy one, one dead, and one very, very hurt. It is their turn. They only get two attacks.
Dungeon Master 03:16:11 15 to hit. 16 to hit. First wolf, top one takes 7 damage. Middle one takes 8 damage. Still not out of it despite being so close. Top of the round, Kaladin.
Zariel Torgan 03:16:13 It's. It's. It's dead. It's also dead.
Kaladen Shash 03:16:42 Walk far enough forward just to get around the corner and then I'll shoot them. 10 won't do it. 17. All right, so one of them takes
Dungeon Master 03:16:53 Go ahead and roll your attacks. 10 won't hit. 17 does hit. Missed it. That really hurt one is like halfway as close to death.
Kaladen Shash 03:17:09 Two, that was so soft, that's almost a good one. Another one's a 10. Real, real shaken back there, her 12. Okay, okay. There's damage on that one. Ah, three, not much. Good enough, get rid of one.
Dungeon Master 03:17:24 12 does hit. Three. Killed one more of them.
Kaladen Shash 03:17:45 Let's. See a run. I won't have enough movement. That's it. I think I'd like. 15 yeah 25. Perception check. Oh come on the 19 for a second.
Dungeon Master 03:17:55 Give me a perception check though as you go into the hallway. 14 though is good enough. You see crawling from a hallway way down just having taken their time to also get here.
Zariel Torgan 03:17:59 Ooooooooooo
Kaladen Shash 03:18:15 14? Just communicate that to everybody. There are more of them.
Dungeon Master 03:18:24 two more intellectual hours are like running towards you. Okay. Do you have the movement to get to them? Because you could take your sword attack against them if you'd like.
Leopold Magnus 03:18:53 I'm not sure I can even get past all of them. They're kind of blocking that choke point, right?
Kaladen Shash 03:18:53 Are you asking me or Leopold? No, because I moved, I was already standing at, so I was 15 feet. I can get within five feet of this one. I could only get within maybe 10 feet of these two, so.
Zariel Torgan 03:18:59 Bye.
Dungeon Master 03:18:59 Yeah. Okay, so then it'll be, Leopold, your turn then. No, yeah, the bear form is a little big in the hallway.
Leopold Magnus 03:19:25 uh so what what is what's that yeah yeah yeah um yeah i just won't be able to shoot a stone it's 25 feet to the so i i'll be able to do that
Kaladen Shash 03:19:26 You were very large. But sorry, I think. So I think you'll use most of your movement just getting to that spot. I still, I still had a few feet. Is it OK if I had just moved my character just around the corner a little further?
Dungeon Master 03:19:55 You can get like level with it so you can like peek out of the hallway but you can't pass him because he's a large worm in the median hallway.
Kaladen Shash 03:19:59 It's quite true.
Leopold Magnus 03:19:59 The bear blocks that entirely, or I guess Kaladin was kind of... Okay. Then I will use one of my stones to hit this little brainy boy.
Leopold Magnus 03:20:31 I'll do that as a bonus action. I guess if I bonus action with the stones Can I action with another spell? Okay, so I'll do one stone on this guy's a bonus action Like I was talking about
Dungeon Master 03:20:43 Uh, yeah. And does not hit. Some unfortunate rolls at you guys.
Leopold Magnus 03:21:01 10 to hit? Yeah, pretty weak. Then I'll just throw a firebolt at that same one. 24 to hit. Yeah, solid. 4 damage.
Dungeon Master 03:21:21 24 hits. 4 damage. It affected it.
Leopold Magnus 03:21:33 Then that's the end of Leopold's turn. The defender will roll to become unstunned. Not gonna happen. Standing there doing nothing that whole game.
Dungeon Master 03:21:48 Can't do it. Azariel, it is your turn. Yeah, you are sort of the block in the hallway.
Zariel Torgan 03:21:54 Um, yeah, can, can I, as a bear, can I jump past these guys? Cause they're little. All right. I'll go right here on this side of them and then I'll take my attacks. Let's see. It's going to be.
Zariel Torgan 03:22:20 18 on the bite, and 13 on the claw. OK. That's going to be 8 bite damage for piercing damage, and then 11 slashing damage on there. Same one. That's what I got.
Dungeon Master 03:22:25 18 hits, 13 hits. The same one or two separate ones? Looking very hurt. Wesley's turn. He will focus up on the one you're at.
Dungeon Master 03:22:55 Close the distance to get advantage, because his ranged wouldn't. He'll take, against a healthy one, he'll take the attack. 17 still hits.
Dungeon Master 03:23:28 That is 23 points of damage. He kills the healthy one. Bonus action attacks the other one. 16 hits. I think...
Kaladen Shash 03:23:48 you.
Dungeon Master 03:23:56 He does it no matter what, but maybe not. Kills, kills the other one. Both dead up at the top. After that, it is this one guy down here can attack that one wolf. Natural one. Misses. Calvin, finish it off.
Kaladen Shash 03:24:27 They're trying to. OK, from distance. Just gonna wildly sling these. These blasts at 26 to hit. Oh, what it's just settled post so poorly to two. Yeah, you see that. Second one. Was premature. Yep, there it goes.
Zariel Torgan 03:24:29 mm-hmm
Dungeon Master 03:24:40 26 hits. 25 hits. It's shown. Okay, very hurt.
Kaladen Shash 03:24:57 Yep. Damage. They're coming through the rule. Last one. OK. 8
Dungeon Master 03:25:17 22 hits. And with only 4 HP left, how do you finish it?
Kaladen Shash 03:25:29 Ah, just from distance, just quick succession, toot, toot, toot. These little pulses, beams just pop it. It just explodes.
Zariel Torgan 03:25:31 You.
Dungeon Master 03:25:38 First two black blow out its front legs and it falls forward, blast blast, goes right to the top of the brain and the whole thing explodes, leaving black ichor all over the ground. You guys are out of combat and after a beat of catching your breath very heavily, you don't hear anything coming at you.
Kaladen Shash 03:26:03 Okay, that's strange family. I don't like that family. It's pretty good.
Zariel Torgan 03:26:06 Man, I'll drop my bear form. That was uh, that was rough you guys. We did pretty good though.
Leopold Magnus 03:26:30 Yeah, I walk up to my steel defender and I start shaking him. Well, I'm going to have to take a look at those circuits. Maybe there's something I could do. Polish you up a little bit.
Zariel Torgan 03:26:34 Ha ha ha ha.
Dungeon Master 03:26:36 You see, after about a minute, it sort of comes back in. It's like system unshocked and starts moving for the first time.
Zariel Torgan 03:27:04 Well, you guys want to go back out on the other side of this pool, maybe look for that circlet? Yeah, I don't think we're finished here.
Kaladen Shash 03:27:11 We gotta find... Yes, we must find the circuit, and perhaps Wesley's friends.
Dungeon Master 03:27:29 Leopold, you were the last one in the pool. Roll me a d4. Let me know what you get.
Zariel Torgan 03:27:36 Uh-oh. How many of his friends are down there? Shit. Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 03:27:37 Okay. Four.
Dungeon Master 03:27:48 Okay. You had seen that there were three cocoons in the brine pool, and as you bring up Wesley's friend, it occurs to you that you saw one of the cocoons had a figure inside of it.
Leopold Magnus 03:28:05 Oh, um, Jens, I regret to inform you that I think there's a good chance his friends aren't, you know, his friends anymore. And I, uh, went back to the cocoon over here, and I saw him in... Um, very astute. Yes, they're family now.
Kaladen Shash 03:28:22 Family. Do you have any idea? Does it seem like they could like it's harmless? The cocoon is just going to stay that way for awhile. Right, correct.
Dungeon Master 03:28:36 You lock up to, it looks, again, it's best described as a cocoon from its general shape, but it is a holding container, and in it is like, you can't really see through the opaque glass, but there is a figure that is unmoving inside of it.
Kaladen Shash 03:28:55 OK, great.
Leopold Magnus 03:29:03 And the other two containers empty? Can I make a quick investigation check? Does it look like the creature inside is maybe transforming or used to tree? Natural one.
Dungeon Master 03:29:08 Yes. Give me a minute.
Zariel Torgan 03:29:11 Okay.
Dungeon Master 03:29:32 Really tough to see through the container. If you opened it up, it'd be much easier, but you can't really see anything as is. I'm going to say with a natural one, you don't see an open switch. But it would make sense that it does open.
Leopold Magnus 03:29:41 Is there an open switch? All right. I'm going to back up. I'm going to launch a firebolt at it. 25 to hit.
Zariel Torgan 03:29:50 Oh shit.
Kaladen Shash 03:29:50 Just break it. It hits. Wow!
Dungeon Master 03:30:02 Roll to hit. 25 hit. You see explodes out the glass in such little damage that it doesn't
Leopold Magnus 03:30:14 Oh, wow. Really, really singing those four ballers out there.
Dungeon Master 03:30:27 hurt the figure inside. You see unconscious laying there this sort of lean but very like raven black colored feathers of this Kenku dressed in like very simple sort of like robe type outer cloak.
Zariel Torgan 03:30:44 Yeah, can I just see if I have it up? I might not have it up.
Dungeon Master 03:30:52 large black beak that extends out past its face, not currently conscious.
Leopold Magnus 03:31:01 Okay, I'll bring him back to the group and I'll say, I think we might want to take a look at this one.
Zariel Torgan 03:31:15 Uh, yeah, I don't have Lesser Restoration. Um, are they still, like, alive? Uh, yeah, yeah. I'll hit him with a... I'll hit him with a Healing Word. See if that wakes him up.
Dungeon Master 03:31:22 Yeah, just seems unconscious. Going forward, you see the chest with a sudden gasp, rises and starts breathing. And you see this bird looks very startled.
Kaladen Shash 03:31:25 You shouldn't be touching. You shouldn't be touching them. You don't know if they work or not.
Dungeon Master 03:31:52 sort of tries to skid away out of Leopold's grip before eyes as you said you brought him out and I imagine everybody's sort of you're no longer bare for him if you're testing healing words so you'll be there. Very panicked until you see this Kenku sees Wesley and in short almost mythic
Zariel Torgan 03:32:06 Oh yeah, I wanted to drop that earlier, yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:32:20 hype vocabulary. The bird almost talks in different voices, but is relatively its own. But just first thing says is, Wesley, almost as if Wesley had said it. And then you hear, after like some chittering of the beak, the next thing is, our friends.
Dungeon Master 03:32:52 Just looking at everybody. Yeah, this is so glad to see him alive. This is Tucker.
Kaladen Shash 03:32:56 It's your friend. Wesley, do you know this? Is this one of your friends?
Zariel Torgan 03:32:56 Figure out Wesley. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:33:15 This little chap is quite the wizard with his incantations, let me tell you that. And you see Tucker looks very proud of himself and sort of ruffles his feathers up and goes, almost more like a parrot than anything, but goes, fireball.
Zariel Torgan 03:33:34 Heh. Heh. Heh heh heh.
Kaladen Shash 03:33:35 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 03:33:40 Can I make a, I don't know, an arcana check, or maybe a medicine check would be more appropriate, just to look to see if there's evidence of a worm that burrowed in him. Maybe he's kind of a doomed fella.
Dungeon Master 03:33:54 Um, you're like, right. Like again, he's trying to escape your grip, but you're much larger. He's like a small to medium humanoid creature. Um, very frail, like very birdlike. So you have them pretty well in your grasp. Um, no check even needed. You see out of one of his like ear holes on the side of his head, do you see dried blood on his feathers sort of leaking out of one of them? Uh, and you would know right away that that definitely means that he's got like a parasite in his head.
Kaladen Shash 03:34:23 It's infectious.
Leopold Magnus 03:34:26 Yeah, I'll inform Wesley of the bad news. I'm afraid your friend Tucker here is not going to make it. I'll tell him telepathically. Because I can't communicate in whatever language she's speaking anyways. I don't speak whatever it is. Yeah, Sylvan.
Zariel Torgan 03:34:33 Well.
Dungeon Master 03:34:33 of verbally or telepathically? You say this to Wesley telepathically and in like a very serious look comes across his face and he goes to you in your head, well I don't understand if he's not
Dungeon Master 03:35:04 changed yet how do you how do you know what if it takes a while well if we we if we take care of whatever's at the root of this he won't change though right
Leopold Magnus 03:35:09 Well, there's a certain amount of time here, and none of us are going to be able to save him, I'm afraid. Indeed. Would I know enough? I probably wouldn't specifically know enough about these worms, but I imagine they're pretty well intertwined with his well-being.
Dungeon Master 03:35:37 You know nothing about these worms. But it's, he says his friend had been missing at least since the morning before he met you. So you guys took a long rest. That's been at least one day that it's been in his body potentially.
Leopold Magnus 03:35:41 Right. Okay. What do you guys want to do with this guy? I think he's probably going to turn into one of these mind flayers if
Leopold Magnus 03:36:11 Pretty soon. Then mark him.
Kaladen Shash 03:36:12 Well, unless we can. Yeah, I mean it's. Party along until he switches. I don't know. Ask Wesley what he wants to do. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 03:36:25 Yeah, well I would... Yeah, I would say...
Dungeon Master 03:36:30 Wesley is vehemently opposed. Like, just very frustrated, but again, you guys are all standing in silence, so this Kenku is not in this loop, it's just looking at you guys, staring at each other. And just in, out of nowhere, just goes... Sure, quiet. Sure, quiet. And just, like, looking around, ruffles his feathers, goes... Looks at Wesley, as you guys are talking in your head, and goes...
Kaladen Shash 03:36:43 Peace.
Dungeon Master 03:36:58 And Wesley is distracted, but in you guys' head, back to the conversation, Wesley goes, I know we only just met, I'll owe you huge, I promise, but don't just kill my friend.
Zariel Torgan 03:37:18 No, I mean, don't you guys have, like, a village where you could, like, maybe have people, like, that know magic that might be able to help? Look at this, a little more specialized than us.
Kaladen Shash 03:37:25 Okay.
Dungeon Master 03:37:34 I mean, yes, I guess our town shaman, Old Cornelius, he's the most adept at sorts of magic. But, you know, even he had to go visit, you know, her once. Like, he's not all powerful.
Leopold Magnus 03:38:00 Well, perhaps maybe the hag would have something useful to say about this situation.
Dungeon Master 03:38:06 right sorry that is her she we don't always just call her the hag but the old woman in the forest the most powerful witch you know she calls herself a couple things we've only seen her a couple times um she um well i'll let cornelius tell it when we get there but uh
Dungeon Master 03:38:32 Can I have at least... I know it doesn't matter a whole lot, but he pulled out his little paw and he's like, can I have your word that you won't kill Tucker until he transforms at least?
Zariel Torgan 03:38:53 How cool was it?
Kaladen Shash 03:38:53 with your close sister?
Leopold Magnus 03:38:53 Well, I suppose. Yes, I think we can hold off, but I think you should brace yourself. Tucker may not be himself for much longer.
Dungeon Master 03:38:58 I'm sorry, it almost sounded like you all talked at the exact same time. I have a hard time deciphering it in my brain. And I think we either have a job to do, sticking out to whatever is the cause of this,
Dungeon Master 03:39:28 we find the rest of my friends and we just leave or or whatever whatever that circlet was um we could always that you think that would help right that's what you guys are saying
Kaladen Shash 03:39:41 It could certainly help. We need to continue to search. How many more friends do you have, two more to find?
Dungeon Master 03:39:57 He goes, yes, Tucker is our, well, I guess he's not technically a wizard. Magic comes a little more innately to him, but then there's Herb. He's more of our brute muscle of our group. And Darwin is more of our tracker.
Zariel Torgan 03:40:19 Yeah, well, we're not done here yet. Not by a long shot, so we'll keep it going.
Dungeon Master 03:40:32 Thank you. Tucker is waiting just kind of patiently.
Zariel Torgan 03:40:48 Yeah, I mean, I figure we just keep the Kenku with us until... Yeah, I mean, we're gonna have to keep going through this dungeon and get the rest of them out. So, I say we... Yeah, absolutely. I say we go back and plan on going back and getting that circlet, and then come back and just start clearing out these fuckers.
Kaladen Shash 03:40:55 Until something bad happens. He's the one extra. He's one extra body that helps for now. Yeah, we're pretty sure the circlets in the other building or is that just like? Or the conclusion that we're drawing there?
Zariel Torgan 03:41:26 I feel like we're fairly confident. Oh, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 03:41:31 All right, yep. All right, so it's gonna be a minute, two, three weeks. Okay. We'll have to try to get a, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 03:41:32 At least give it a check, yeah. Yeah, I guess we'll have to think about what we're going to be doing.
Dungeon Master 03:41:41 Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 03:42:04 get an in-person session going to after the long break. We're headed back into town like New Year's Eve and then just working the rest of that week and chilling that weekend. I don't know what you guys have going on.
Kaladen Shash 03:42:09 Exactly. I'll be back in town by then.
Zariel Torgan 03:42:09 Yeah, that'd be cool.
Dungeon Master 03:42:24 Uh, I yeah, in town right now, um, probably not leaving. So have, uh, I do work unfortunately, uh, the second and third, but I'm off that weekend.
Kaladen Shash 03:42:45 Yeah. Same here. You'll be right.
Leopold Magnus 03:42:48 OK. How about you, Jesse? Are you around that weekend after the 1st? OK, well, maybe that works out like the 4th or the 5th. Cool.
Zariel Torgan 03:42:56 Um, I think so. I don't think I have anything going on after. I think I'm fully open. Yeah, I could do something like that. I mean, if we could, that'd be sweet.
Dungeon Master 03:43:15 That's going to do in person. Yeah. OK, I'll put it like yeah, and I'll let you know if there's it doesn't work for some reason.
Leopold Magnus 03:43:17 Yes, that would be fun. That would catch us up, you know, because generally we play a little longer. Great. All right, I'll put it in the chat here.
Kaladen Shash 03:43:17 Do the do the do the dungeon crawl in person here we go. Yeah. And we leveled up. Level up.
Zariel Torgan 03:43:26 Oh yeah. Oh, that'd be sweet. Sweet. Yeah, I was just going to say, we're eight now, right? What?
Dungeon Master 03:43:47 No, not yet. I haven't even read. What are you talking about?
Kaladen Shash 03:43:49 Sorry. Yeah, I was a little sorry. I'll keeping that going for a minute. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 03:43:50 Damn. Yeah, I did nothing, basically. I was just stunned or dominated that whole fight, so. Yeah, thank God. I only have one pup left. It's a handy spell.
Zariel Torgan 03:44:05 Ayyyy, it was me and my eight wolves. Yeah, they all got munched. It's pretty, it's pretty kick-ass. I'm pretty happy about it.
Dungeon Master 03:44:20 Bye.

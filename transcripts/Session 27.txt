Dungeon Master 00:00:00 things in there, and if you have me looking at my screen, that's less interesting. Craig fucks, by the way, just so we can get that under. Absolutely. Because that's the only option. Okay, guys.
Kaladen Shash 00:00:05 Okay. It's for sure.
Cletus Cobbington 00:00:09 There's anything he does, it's at least that.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:11 Right.
Zariel Torgan 00:00:11 At the very least.
Dungeon Master 00:00:30 Last session, you guys started off in Cletus's willow-shaped tiny hut, where the air was thick with the scent of almond milk and an unfortunate amount of dog excrement. As the hut dissolved in the morning, you stepped back into the Kiari Rung forest, the goal still to reach the ruined North Dome of Moonhaven to, if death, gain entry and reestablish the teleportation capability to get yourselves home.
Cletus Cobbington 00:00:40 Amen.
Cyrus Schwert 00:00:51 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:00:59 Simple in theory, less so in execution so far. Things kicked off in a somewhat typical fashion for the group, where Cletus tried to bond with Cyrus by offering him an almond that had been lovingly moistened by Chip.
Cletus Cobbington 00:01:17 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:01:19 Cyrus, not wanting to ruffle Chip's feathers, so to speak, ate it anyway and gained the nice ability that was ruined for the first day because nothing happened. So he got it the next day as well. So he had to suck on another moist almond. The first morning, though, Leo also worked on crafting a magical feeder for Zariel's wolf pups, complete with a steak-scented lure and a timed voice command to try to aid in training.
Kaladen Shash 00:01:32 you you
Cyrus Schwert 00:01:33 Fucking disgusting.
Dungeon Master 00:01:47 This is also where I went and did the math on it. It has been roughly, it's getting close to a month since the last full moon. So you're thinking there's going to be one coming up pretty soon. Just to keep in mind, Jesse. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:01:51 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 00:02:03 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:02:07 Gotcha. I got something with that, but we can go into that in a second. Gotcha.
Dungeon Master 00:02:11 I'm just putting it back in the brain. The day came with a few mishaps. A bad survivor will send you back towards the town of Cottonwood. Not all the way, but on the way there. Cletus made a comment about just abandoning the adventuring party to make an almond farm there. But eventually you all got back on track, heading deeper into the swampy terrain.
Dungeon Master 00:02:32 After a while, you discover two ancient, half-buried, dwarven, sphinx-like statues that had an aura of necromantic and enchantment energy. When asking a local elderly squirrel, he dismissed them as his piss and shit rocks. That they had also been there for as long as he can remember and never moved. Taking this sort of wisdom, we can say, you moved on without really investigating it too much further.
Dungeon Master 00:03:03 As you guys all continued, Zariel continuing what I can only describe as a ridiculous perception check in natural 20 run. It has been like the last six sessions where anytime Jesse has to make like a perception check, it's 25 plus. Just killing, man. Truly great. You noticed something strange. There was a plume of smoke rising from the very peak of Drake's roost.
Cyrus Schwert 00:03:03 We tried.
Zariel Torgan 00:03:19 It's been pretty great.
Dungeon Master 00:03:30 followed by something, from what you can tell, ejecting from the volcano, streaking into the sky, and then disappeared. Disappeared before anybody else could see it, and...
Dungeon Master 00:03:40 There wasn't much after just like short watch, no change, nothing to comment on. This lit out an ominous omen before it, before anybody can investigate it further, a torrential rain downpour began delaying you by another stay travel as you had to sort of travel the densest part of the forest to stay under the most dense canopy to keep yourself dry, kind of slowed the entire pace.
Kaladen Shash 00:04:01 Hello.
Dungeon Master 00:04:06 As that day came to a close, Kaladin attempted yet again to enchant his Ring of Protection, only to blind himself in the process of correcting the runes. Leopold, on the other hand, successfully integrated his Phoenix Feather into Bonecrusher's core, giving it an innate fire resistance ability, and then had Electitude the next thing be improve the general armor class.
Cletus Cobbington 00:04:11 you you
Dungeon Master 00:04:31 As morning came, you continued in the right direction yet again, but had an unfortunate shout out to the two crew role for the encounter check.
Dungeon Master 00:04:41 which set up for the next big encounter. You entered a foggy, eerily silent, swampy clearing with bubbling bogs and a heavy air decomposing fungal matter. Zariel, on another natural 20, differentiated that the jagged stone that came out of the water was not stone, in fact, but appeared to be a horn material belonging to an ever so slightly moving creature below the surface.
Dungeon Master 00:05:08 realizing with somewhat high intelligence that it had been made, it did not have any sort of surprise effect, and you guys launched into combat with a very large adult black dragon. The fight, proven to be somewhat brutal, ended with Kaladin...
Cletus Cobbington 00:05:20 you
Dungeon Master 00:05:28 Leopold and Cyrus becoming sort of the upfront duo fighting with the arcane blast in the back. Uh, Cletus turned into a giant eight, um, trying to have some effect, but unfortunately didn't land his first couple of hits. Didn't contribute a lot until he had, uh, put into effect the Rizzlers, his group of Vader archers who stood back and let fire a rain of arrows, uh,
Cletus Cobbington 00:05:50 Hmm. Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:05:57 As this fight continued and the dragon realized that its imminent demise was upon it, it attempted to flee. Zariel, exploding into his fire elemental form, chased to keep pace and to keep combat alive. He took heavy hits in the process, including a full acid breath, but held on nonetheless. It ended with
Dungeon Master 00:06:20 Cletus, of all people, frustrated from earlier, hurled an enormous magic stone towards it, snapping its wing and sending it flying into a large, jagged, broke-down tree, killing it instantly. You harvested the parts, set up your tiny hut once more, and everybody, not everybody, a few people had these sort of intense, lucid dreaming episodes on set.
Cletus Cobbington 00:06:33 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:06:45 Zariel seemed to be transported to a forgotten memory, something that's happening more and more frequently as time progressed. You remember waking up in sort of a closet space in Stasis, your apparent master, a very fair-skinned, elegant-moving, red-haired elf male with pretty powerful arcane ability from what you can tell with how much he was just wielding around easily.
Dungeon Master 00:07:11 For the first time, previously he only had referred to you as Robot. He called you Zero.
Dungeon Master 00:07:16 and sent you on a couple errands and made it very specially clear that under no circumstances were you to reveal that he was heading out of the domes. You were to put on this believable story that he had went to visit the Lord of Advancement in Phylantra. A believable story because the person you're talking to apparently created you and had pretty good automaton sort of crafting and engineering abilities and knowledge.
Leopold Magnus 00:07:21 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:07:44 You decided to push sort of the realm and the bounds of this lucid dream state by questioning the first century you found at the base level of the tower, asking him some questions that in theory could have happened at that time. You asked him the year to which he responded. It was 222 PDC, which is post-dome construction.
Cletus Cobbington 00:08:05 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:08:08 You know that currently it's around the year 1099, so this is much farther in the past. You also asked where you were, to which he replied that you were in the Emerald District of Isopdra.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:25 Gotcha.
Dungeon Master 00:08:25 You then attempted to do something that could not have happened at that time, sort of breaking this melding of minds and time. You sort of bridged between you currently and you in the past. You found out through this that at that time,
Kaladen Shash 00:08:37 um,
Dungeon Master 00:08:44 the robot that is in your body deemed zero did not have any sort of magical ability. And by trying to cast Polymorph, ruptured the reality you were sort of experiencing, shunting you back into your current state. The next thing that happened was Cyrus reliving a memory probably invoked by what you had seen earlier in that day. You remembered that you had been traveling through and in between your lecture halls. You cast your sort of
Zariel Torgan 00:08:55 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:09:14 half elf friend named Aaron who slid you some ancient text that he had snuck out a forbidden tome detailing like expeditions outside of the domes in the first few years after the construction sort of these heroic tales and
Dungeon Master 00:09:32 You zoned out in your art history class reading them about this adventuring party that set out in the far north outside of Isoptera towards one of the celestial world trees, this one being called the Tree of Death. Trees so large that they tower over entire mountain ranges and spread all the way up into the clouds. There's only two on the continent, very commonly known as the Tree of Death and the Tree of Life.
Dungeon Master 00:10:00 You had an eerie feeling sort of spread down your spine, and you looked over your shoulder to see nothing. But what you had missed, not to your own fault, was sort of walking in between planes or two figures. So we ended the session as we transitioned to Kaladin. It is about two hours into your four-hour trance.
Kaladen Shash 00:10:19 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:10:25 You are uncharacteristically, as with the rest of the party, feeling very fatigued and you find yourself slipping and almost falling into unconsciousness. Some investigation, you would almost certainly detail that you were being put under almost a magical sleep. You are falling into this state and...
Dungeon Master 00:10:48 You sort of awaken, and it's sort of an empty void. It's like a dream space where everywhere around you is just limitlessly far. It's infinite, so you are just stuck in place. But then you feel like your hair sort of starts rising above your head. A gentle breeze brushes over your skin, your arms, your neck, your face, and it has direction. You can feel your hair sort of going up, and you realize that you are falling.
Dungeon Master 00:11:17 You were falling through this space and then quickly your stomach sort of rises into your chest, giving you almost a sick sensation as you can realize you're falling very quickly before you finally land in a three-point stance with a very loud thud on this. From what you can tell,
Dungeon Master 00:11:35 It's like this large, circular, black, somewhat opaque glass platform that you stand on, reflecting a light that is sourceless as far as you can tell, just catching it at certain angles. This is a familiar space to you. You see there is this black, sheer sort of curtain material on the periphery of all of your vision. The only difference, though, is that...
Dungeon Master 00:12:00 Similar to Zariel, but you don't know this at that point, you feel like you're in a lucid state. You have autonomy over your body and your mind, but you can tell you are dreaming. Also different, if you want to give me a perception check to see if you get more, but you can see that it is not a full encapsulated circle like it was before. There seems to be a glass walkway heading into the darkness ahead of you.
Kaladen Shash 00:12:28 You said a perception? Not great.
Dungeon Master 00:12:31 Perception check, yes. Not amazing. You are, I think, a little too distracted by the just absurdity of your surroundings. This seems...
Dungeon Master 00:12:55 You seem almost weightless as you move. Every step gives a resonating thud as your foot hits the glass. You see there are distant sources of light. I said it had been sources before, but you're looking out into the void space. And it's almost like you can see something, but you can't focus on what it is. And you don't know how far you can walk onto this platform. But you start moving through. There is a tunnel ahead of you and nothing else around you. What would you like to do?
Kaladen Shash 00:13:24 I don't see anything like in my other dream, like that creepy fightery. Yes, yeah. Yes. OK, yeah, I'll move right forward. I'll walk through the tunnel.
Dungeon Master 00:13:32 You mean that creepy nine-foot-tall, very long-legged and armed creature? No, you do not see anything from there.
Dungeon Master 00:13:47 You walk through this space and the sheer fabric almost transitions to just looking like clear. You can tell there's like an energy field sort of holding everything in place. But you start looking out and you get a little bit better sight. It is truly just an empty space, but it's not a dreamscape like you thought. As you walk through, you go ahead and give me.
Dungeon Master 00:14:13 Give me a nature, not a nature. Give me an arcana check or a history check. They could be the same role, but they might be higher in one over the other. It's better. You are not sure with a 17 because this is, while in D&D is something that's very present in the world that you live in, this is almost unheard of.
Kaladen Shash 00:14:22 Yeah. Better.
Dungeon Master 00:14:39 you've read and studied on something called the astral sea just this void space of celestial bodies where people will themselves to fly around um you're walking on this platform that as you're walking is very uniform you can tell that this is of like magical creation everything is very consistent with it the same sort of repeating shapes as it is laid out and sealed and you were walking in like a
Dungeon Master 00:15:08 structure floating in the astral sea is your best guess.
Dungeon Master 00:15:12 And as you leave this hallway, you enter a round sort of room. When I say round, I mean it stretches out, and then the walls and the floor and ceiling sort of bend together eventually, like very Space Needlesque, Futuresque looking. And it sort of looks out into this space, a very dark parallel with something Zara had seen. As you're walking forward towards the end of...
Cletus Cobbington 00:15:24 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:15:30 Okay. What side of the glass, like just...
Dungeon Master 00:15:41 the room almost as if if you imagine it this way if you are walking here and somebody is walking directly below you on the other side of the glass as you hit the end this figure sort of wraps around almost mid-step you see he goes from being invisible to directly in front of you causing you to sort of step back this is the figure you were asking about before but
Dungeon Master 00:16:10 Similar to the first time, when you had seen this creature or this humanoid, initially it was like a shadow. And then it was like this arachnid, extended, featured, distorted, fae-elf kind of figure. The figure you see ahead of you today, or tonight, is the same height. Fully at least nine feet tall.
Kaladen Shash 00:16:17 Yep.
Dungeon Master 00:16:35 elongated elven ears but they're very fey in the fact that they're huge and they go kind of backwards a little bit ending in sharp points the face is a little bit more fair a little bit less stretched skin over a skull and just like a very gaunt muscular face sharp edges deep cheek recesses leading into
Dungeon Master 00:16:59 these like glowing green iridescent eyes, very alien when you look at it, but it's the most humanoid it seems. Flowing dark black long hair sort of wafts and sits on the shoulders, but it's got some weightlessness to it. And similar to before, this figure is still wearing a very nice but old and tattered like
Cletus Cobbington 00:17:12 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:17:26 black suit robe combo very powerful very elegant looking when it was new but it's just filled with cuts and tears and it's covered in dirt and it's got standing around the cuffs of both the arms and the legs and this figure just stares at you silently for a moment and you can tell that it's waiting for you to say something very expectantly
Kaladen Shash 00:17:53 Last time I encountered it, or last time it had a dream with it, didn't it tell me not to run from it, but listen to it or whatever? Give it a chance? Yeah. I'll just...
Cletus Cobbington 00:18:05 And.
Dungeon Master 00:18:07 it had said if it tried to approach you to give it a chance and it had hinted to that you had been misled
Kaladen Shash 00:18:24 I'll just interact with it and say, why have I seen you in my dreams?
Dungeon Master 00:18:38 You see once it's been made clear that you heeded the words a little bit, you are not running and you are engaging. You see this very tight face that he had, holding a very stern, blank expression, relaxes, and he lets on a little smirk. You can't see into his mouth, but you almost can tell that he's got sharp teeth kind of vibe. And just very slowly he starts with, I appreciate it.
Dungeon Master 00:19:08 the chance to chat. As I hinted, blood of my blood, I have discovered we are connected, in a sense, tied at the soul. Well,
Kaladen Shash 00:19:27 I don't know what you're talking about. What do you mean tied at the soul?
Dungeon Master 00:19:38 You've been kind enough to engage and talk. So I will let you on to some knowledge if you ask. There are powerful forces that would see me not existing. So if you ask a question I am not comfortable with answering, I beg your forgiveness in my silence. As far as I can tell, you are a distant nephew.
Cletus Cobbington 00:19:41 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:20:03 OK, uncle. What powers would our God? Of course, he will. Just listen.
Dungeon Master 00:20:07 At best, enough of my blood to grant a tether to the material plane. You can think of me as like a fun uncle, if you will.
Cletus Cobbington 00:20:28 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:20:32 What forces would not want you to live? Why do you seem to be stuck where you are? Why do you need me?
Dungeon Master 00:20:41 He looks around, and he's got... Him standing, his waist is at your mid-belly, sort of mid-chest area. His arms are so long, they sit even farther down than they would normally. He's got definitely a positive ape index. His arms are so long. His fingers end in large, almost talent points. They're so big. And he sort of gestures to the space around, and he goes...
Dungeon Master 00:21:11 Some amount of time ago, I made enemies with the wrong group. I was banished to this godforsaken sea. Nothingness. Lost my physical form, but you can't take innate power, innate gifts. I was just a thought at first, and then I was a shroud.
Dungeon Master 00:21:42 And then rather quickly, I found myself growing, tied to something. I would dream of what I assume is the material plane through what I figured out to be your eyes. You somehow gave me breath. And as I regained consciousness and sense of self, I built this.
Dungeon Master 00:22:11 And he sort of gestures with the intention of communicating. And he waits, in his mind, answering your question sufficiently. He smirks. Again, there is...
Kaladen Shash 00:22:27 okay but you still didn't say who's upset with you you know it's like the part of the question i want to know
Dungeon Master 00:22:41 Forces that alive and exist even to current date in your daily life. Who I fear seek to see me destroyed entirely. I questioned their rule many years ago and it ended in a bloodbath. The taking of lives was unfortunate.
Dungeon Master 00:23:11 But we all fought for what we deemed to be the right decision. For now. No, I have no physical fault.
Kaladen Shash 00:23:16 um okay so now you're like you know just stuck where you're at right now you have no physical okay and then the other question do you have how how old are you like
Leopold Magnus 00:23:37 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:23:45 How long ago were you on this world, this material plane? Were there domes? Before the dome, OK.
Dungeon Master 00:23:51 That's tough to say. I don't know how long I didn't exist for, but I do remember a time before the Dome. No, he points at his ears. He goes, I am before the Ndubin.
Cletus Cobbington 00:24:03 You.
Kaladen Shash 00:24:21 okay so like i just see you in my dreams for a little while or is this like you know you you're going to ask me now proposition
Dungeon Master 00:24:32 I do have plans that I will reveal in due time. Prematurely launching this would result in my unfortunate dispatching. On the contrary, as we seem to be very tied ethereally, I think it is in my best interest to make sure that you stay in the living as well.
Dungeon Master 00:25:03 So I come offering more advice. My advice is don't trust the First Council. Beyond that,
Kaladen Shash 00:25:11 Okay, what's up? What is this device? Yeah, we're
Dungeon Master 00:25:34 Don't be shy of your gifts. When the Esopter curse took hold of the land, yes, some it distorted. Some it gave great power to. And he looks sort of at your arm and your enhancing fey features. And he goes, I see you have already started to embrace.
Kaladen Shash 00:26:06 Is he looking at my prosthetic arm? OK, cool. I drank potion to do this. This was not. Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:26:10 Yeah. You think any common man and you see he like gestures for you to walk with him and you start walking through this like glass palace and you sort of see you're walking towards a light and you start stepping into
Dungeon Master 00:26:40 He's got like this dreamwalking ability and you see memories of like people he's got some sort of attachment to, but he's not, it's not focused. It's just very blurry happening in the periphery, but he's just chatting with you. He goes, no, there are still many who won the curse would outright kill those who, if consuming a potion of the old world,
Dungeon Master 00:27:07 it would rupture their stomach and they would burn from the inside out. You harness the arcane with such ease because of the curse. And you find that it's at this moment that the both of you walk into a dream that seems to focus. And it's a lecture hall of young to mid-teens. One in particular is paying no attention to, but he's got this old script on his desk sort of hidden behind his other notes.
Dungeon Master 00:27:37 reading a tale about the tree of death and you guys are just he's sort of talking to you next to him and down but you guys are just looking forward at this unfolding and he goes there are some who create they possess great potential to wield the curse none shall wield it as great as another there's always one better
Dungeon Master 00:28:06 But the Asafjik curse was only named by those who opposed it and who feared its potential. It lets you wield the magic of a different age and style. And he goes, that's, I think that's good.
Dungeon Master 00:28:32 Trust that I will be looking out for you. And on last tidbit of advice, I know you must return to New New Harbor. But when you do, retrace your steps. See the deceit before what it is. Seek out allies.
Dungeon Master 00:28:57 And you see he like leaves you. He turns, he spins on his impossibly long legs and he just disappears into darkness. It doesn't seem to, like he doesn't continue on. He just disappears, vanishes into a mist. And you're left in a moment of just watching. He doesn't, there's no listening.
Kaladen Shash 00:29:06 What do I call it?
Dungeon Master 00:29:17 You see a figure who's very familiar to you. Very, also gaunt, but gaunt in a malnourished way. Maybe some acne on his face. Half-elven features of Dyrus sitting at his desk. And for some reason you feel drawn to looking at the Tree of Death. Just very pulled by it. Yeah, kind of, which is
Kaladen Shash 00:29:39 I'm just looking over his shoulder. Cyrus doesn't see me, though. This Cyrus is in his dream.
Dungeon Master 00:29:44 yeah you see it like moments before when you had walked up he you see like he almost his back straightened and his muscles tensed and he gave a brief glance behind him but obviously not seeing anything he sort of looks back forward almost like he just got a weird chill uh but you're sitting there for a moment at like the edge of the room sort of at the wall watching for a second and then
Dungeon Master 00:30:11 You don't realize how much time has passed, but you start coming to consciousness as you have completed your long rest at this point. And to that point, everybody completes their long rest. You are under the protection, the nice, soft, yellow-green light of the fireflies that sort of fly around and buzz underneath Cletus's tiny hut, dome, willow tree.
Dungeon Master 00:30:38 The goal is still the same, to make it to the Dome. But the party of the O'Dears, you have a morning, and then at this point, five days travel left at current pace. Yeah. He didn't offer it, and you didn't ask.
Cletus Cobbington 00:30:39 you you
Kaladen Shash 00:30:51 Hey, Jonathan, would I have called a name, at least? I'll go, what? That's OK. Next time, in my dream, I will ask the question.
Dungeon Master 00:31:14 And not to rag on him too much, but I also would like to point out that the pace is currently being set by Zariel's need to put down the pocket workshop and exchange air every 10 minutes. You guys wake up feeling well-rested.
Kaladen Shash 00:31:27 Right.
Leopold Magnus 00:31:43 So I guess I had one question, Jonathan. The figure that Zariel interacted with, did they bear any resemblance to Wind Rider? Or was that something that was mentioned? Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:31:48 Ask it. That was a... I don't know why the system said that. There was no mention of this figure being Wind Rider. I think it had been asked, and if not, I'll just give it to you, when this figure was talking to Zero,
Cletus Cobbington 00:32:06 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:32:13 I see. Okay, so the figure referred to Lord Windrider was not Lord Windrider himself or herself.
Dungeon Master 00:32:18 as he referred to them as. He did say Lord of Advancement, and then I do believe I said he said Lord Windrider, but this figure that was being talked to was not indicated to be Windrider. Correct.
Leopold Magnus 00:32:45 Got it. Okay. And so it was the instruction was go find Lord Windrider. Understood.
Dungeon Master 00:32:51 go have a conversation with this person. Um, no, not go talk to the, the conversation around that was I'm leaving on an expedition outside of the dome. If anybody comes looking for me, you are to say that I went to a different dome to talk with this person. Potentially.
Cletus Cobbington 00:33:01 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 00:33:06 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:33:10 But that would imply that Kalmara when Ryder was also thousands of years old. Got it. Thanks for the clarification there.
Dungeon Master 00:33:29 Yeah, it was not specified because I have it written down. So committed.
Cletus Cobbington 00:33:29 I love normal dreams. Sips a steaming cup of hot Almond Joe. What'd y'all dream about? I just had the whispering feet with almonds. Chip nods his head.
Cyrus Schwert 00:33:44 Allman's Joe. The Trader Joe's Allman Riddle.
Cletus Cobbington 00:33:57 He had the same dream. Absolutely. How have we not gave him a mug yet?
Dungeon Master 00:34:03 Chip's got a little miniature mug of like a half portion of Almond Joe. You just have one carved in your free time out of wood.
Cyrus Schwert 00:34:14 He doesn't need to. Well, that's his job, so...
Kaladen Shash 00:34:15 Just a hollowed out all in the towel.
Leopold Magnus 00:34:16 Well, Cletus, I think you should be selling this stuff. Maybe when your adventuring days are over, you can go back to your almond farm and make your little mocha shop.
Cletus Cobbington 00:34:26 Very astute. Very astute. I have done that for about 100 years, yes. Remember when I almost rage quit back with that T-Rex? Yeah, that was the plan. We'll see how long it lasts.
Zariel Torgan 00:34:47 We just don't eat nuts, so we don't know him.
Leopold Magnus 00:34:48 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:34:49 Cletus we've never established it but do you want Trace do you want Cletus to have been like the owner of like one of the most famous like almond product lines of the dome like you're secretly a very well known household name that you just haven't really established
Cyrus Schwert 00:35:07 But...
Cletus Cobbington 00:35:09 Yeah. Why do you think I have a bag of unlimited almonds? I've given out so much already. That would be really funny. I want to be...
Dungeon Master 00:35:13 No, it's like you just don't think he's the guy. He just passively goes one day, oh yeah, I'm the owner of Bubba Gum Shrimp, and they're like, holy shit, you're that guy? Anyway, that's food for thought if you want to make Cletus like a powerhouse of the Dome.
Kaladen Shash 00:35:14 which is a golden field.
Cyrus Schwert 00:35:35 His last name is Blue Diamond.
Cletus Cobbington 00:35:37 I want to be like the guy who made the thneed in fucking the Lorax, super omega rich in my factory of almond milk. No, that's too aggressive. No, we'll see. I like humble, but that is really funny too. I'm very humble. I do not show it. That would be funny. We'll see.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:38 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:35:38 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:35:54 No, you are humble, but you just happen to be very wealthy. Yes, it's Romulus and something.
Leopold Magnus 00:36:06 Say, Zario, have you named these two pups yet? Was that what the name you went with? Or I was curious if you're thinking of something else. OK. Sounds good.
Cyrus Schwert 00:36:06 All he does is pay for everything. You're going to blow these dogs up. You have a microwave?
Zariel Torgan 00:36:11 I do like that name. I do like that name, but I think I'm going to do something that might blow the whole thing up, so I'm going to wait and see how that goes before I get too attached. Yeah. I was going to say, yeah, it's just a metaphor. I'm just going to blow them up.
Kaladen Shash 00:36:14 Yeah, that's right. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:36:28 As long as it doesn't make me retire.
Dungeon Master 00:36:32 Interesting. Love it. Fetch, and then...
Zariel Torgan 00:36:40 I'm going to try something. Wouldn't it be just wild to go through the whole arc of trying to train these stupid dogs just to have them just kill them? So much wasted in-game time. Yeah. Yeah, they just blow up.
Leopold Magnus 00:36:52 Fucking microwave them.
Dungeon Master 00:37:01 You guys pack up your base camp and you start heading on your way for the day. We'll skip the just so you don't keep losing days. We'll skip their survival check on the first day. But as the day progresses, somebody just give me an encounter check to sort of set the pace for the day.
Cletus Cobbington 00:37:04 I believe I may have summoned a dragon, so I don't want to...
Zariel Torgan 00:37:20 Hot damn. We get there.
Kaladen Shash 00:37:22 Yeah, who wants that?
Leopold Magnus 00:37:25 Well, I'll do it. See what happens. Okay, go for it. Do it. Do it. Hell yeah. We need to do that.
Cyrus Schwert 00:37:31 I'll do it. Oh. Oh. Come on. Too poppy. Let's fucking go. We're there.
Cletus Cobbington 00:37:39 Cyrus, you're very pushy nowadays. 20 drag.
Dungeon Master 00:37:44 A natural 20. Okay. You guys...
Kaladen Shash 00:37:52 Get out of the box.
Leopold Magnus 00:37:55 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:37:58 progress through the forest um making good speed in fact the weather is nice the atmosphere having dropped most of its moisture the day before the air feels humid but you guys have beautiful weather peeking through the denseness of the canopy at some point you find a general opening where the trees are not so bad huge foliage and folds large bushes
Dungeon Master 00:38:25 big palmy trees. Um, and you guys, it bask in the sun as you travel, you shave a day off. So this is day five slash four. Um, and as you guys are traveling, everybody is moving. Um, I think maybe it's just the inclination for his ears to pick up on, on music and, um,
Cletus Cobbington 00:38:42 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:38:49 just the notes of the high ringing of things but everybody's moving sort of head to the nose to the grindstone kind of pace of just looking down and trekking osiris you keep picking up like the jingling and ringing that you hear of like wind chimes or like crystals like it's a very nice repetitive ringing sound often to the distance
Cyrus Schwert 00:39:15 Is it like in the path where we're going? Or it's like... Guys, I hear something cool and whimsical out here. Do you think there's good things and not just like T-Rexes and dragons and shit?
Dungeon Master 00:39:20 it'd be a little bit of a detour, but you don't, it sounds close enough that it wouldn't be far.
Cletus Cobbington 00:39:33 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:39:43 I have no idea. What do you hear exactly? So not very far away, like you hear pretty good.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:45 I would imagine so.
Cyrus Schwert 00:39:50 It's like wind chimes or like... Yeah. Yeah, my ears keep twitching. I can just barely hear it. Can we just take a little... We've been making really good time. We haven't hit a large reptile in a while. I feel like we can take a second.
Kaladen Shash 00:40:13 Let's just let us investigate.
Cletus Cobbington 00:40:21 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 00:40:23 Can I lead the group towards the sound?
Dungeon Master 00:40:27 Yeah. You guys walk out into, similar to what Zariel had seen that one time, it's like a very, you end up in a large clearing, sort of what you assume is on the eastern sort of side of the Chiari Rung Forest. And it picks up in your ears a little bit louder each time, but eventually everybody can see it. You get this like glint of purple and it gets larger and you realize that it's this
Dungeon Master 00:40:56 10 to 15 foot tall crystal amethyst sculpture of a dragon. Gorgeous. Just sitting on a pedestal in the open field on the grass.
Dungeon Master 00:41:12 There's like amethyst crystals jutting out of the ground, uncut, crisscrossing, some large, some small, some just little patches. There's just this light ringing of these crystals as everything sort of resonates off of each other. There's this chain.
Dungeon Master 00:41:29 Heavy iron that is hanging around this statue with a lock on it that gives off actively like this sort of resonating yellow aura visible to everybody. Low thrum from it. And there seems to be some like filigreed etched in writing on the base of the statue. Got this little plaque.
Cyrus Schwert 00:41:59 And can we read this black? Is it in common or language? Close.
Dungeon Master 00:42:05 It is in Draconic, actually. So does anybody speak or read Draconic? As you guys know, Chuck,
Zariel Torgan 00:42:07 Yeah, I don't have it.
Kaladen Shash 00:42:12 Oh, I can ritual cast Comprehend Languages, I think. Yeah, Comprehend Language. Ten minutes. Nobody else can do it.
Cyrus Schwert 00:42:30 I don't think I can.
Dungeon Master 00:42:34 needed or anything, but as Kaladin sort of plops down to crisscross and he
Dungeon Master 00:42:41 slams open his book and he starts reciting out this long chain of arcane chanting his tongue sort of like starts resonating and it splits vocals for a little bit and by the time he's finished you guys are looking around nothing happens but he can read and understand any language that he reads and as you walk up to it Kaladin you see it says long ago we were sealed away
Dungeon Master 00:43:11 at the fear of what we could become. Next line. Understandable to our power, I let it be as I was the only one allowed to be seen. And then it says little slash like it's from, it's who it's from. And then the name is Bellondrill. B-E-L-L-O-N-D-R-Y-L.
Kaladen Shash 00:43:35 you
Dungeon Master 00:43:42 below that you see almost covered up in like overgrown moss it's like been trying to get hidden so you sort of brush off the moss and you can read through dirty stone it says release the gemstone dragons and be granted a boon
Kaladen Shash 00:44:05 I obviously am reading this out loud the whole time to the group. What?
Leopold Magnus 00:44:12 Jonathan, can I do an investigation check in the area to see if there's other potential covered gemstone dragons? Maybe they're overgrown with moss or have fallen over and they're half buried in the ground or something. Perception. Nice. All right.
Dungeon Master 00:44:26 You could give me a perception check for that. You can give him a plus two to his roll. Ooh. Plus a five plus two is 12.
Zariel Torgan 00:44:30 Yeah, could I either also do that or give him advantage? Damn.
Leopold Magnus 00:44:41 Well, that came in handy. I took a skill expert. So now I'm proficient in perception. Although it didn't help very much because I only rolled a five.
Cletus Cobbington 00:44:49 Hell yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:44:55 And it's a 12 over the span of 10 minutes, right? That's what I said. He sits down and Kaladin starts reading out of his book. And you guys had time to sort of look around. And it seemed pretty innocuous, not a whole lot here. But Leopold makes the point of looking for similar things. And you can tell that this is like a very detailed and intricate gem statue draped with these huge heavy iron chains and locks.
Dungeon Master 00:45:23 And everything else in the surrounding area is just like long, soft, laid to its side grass with like very obvious crystals jutting out of the ground. You can tell this is the only statue like this in the area.
Leopold Magnus 00:45:38 Got it. Well, everything's a shit and stump to somebody. I guess one...
Cletus Cobbington 00:45:40 Ah, just another shit and stump. Yeah, are there any holes? Definitely not. Four for shit.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:44 Did you say open? You mean free the thing? Right.
Cyrus Schwert 00:45:44 Picket size for acorns. Open.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:54 well what do you think we open this thing or what
Dungeon Master 00:45:56 Give me a shit check. There's not a speck of shit anywhere on this statue. This is flawless. Yeah, go ahead and give me an arcana check.
Leopold Magnus 00:46:06 I was going to say one last thing before we open it. I could do it. It's a flawless clean statue. Did I do an Arcana check on the stone? Dirty 20.
Cletus Cobbington 00:46:15 Wow.
Dungeon Master 00:46:40 Let me figure something out real quick. Okay. You and what was that again? That was just an Arcana check.
Cletus Cobbington 00:46:46 You.
Leopold Magnus 00:46:54 Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:46:55 Without casting a spell, you don't get the exact nature of it, but the very obvious resonating aura that comes off of that very obvious lock, you can tell from the way that it interacts with reality and the way it undulates, it is very familiar and indicative of abjuration.
Kaladen Shash 00:47:34 OK, like what do you guys think? The plaque has been here for a while. Why has nobody else done this?
Zariel Torgan 00:47:40 That's a good point. Yeah. Yeah, why didn't any of the goat people open this thing, though? Oh...
Cletus Cobbington 00:47:45 I just need the Rizzlers to do it. Maybe they can...
Dungeon Master 00:47:46 maybe because nobody is outside of the dome, you know. You hear somewhere in the meta of the world that nobody had rolled a nat 20 on it before, kind of, you know.
Cyrus Schwert 00:47:51 Nobody's outside of the dome. They can't read Dragon, probably. Sure, sure. They're kind of the heroes.
Leopold Magnus 00:47:58 Uh...
Cletus Cobbington 00:48:14 to feed these bees.
Zariel Torgan 00:48:16 Yeah, let's crack this thing open. Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it. Yeah, how could this go wrong?
Dungeon Master 00:48:16 You have a lock that's like big, just like the old fashioned like iron lock that has magic around it. How would you guys like to approach this?
Kaladen Shash 00:48:17 I mean, it says let's gain a boon, so it's, I mean, break the chain. Like, let's go. Ready yourself.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:25 Yeah, I think this is a good idea. I have a good feeling about this. Yeah, well, so you said this was aberration.
Cletus Cobbington 00:48:46 you
Kaladen Shash 00:48:47 And you just cut through it with your lightsaber? Because you melted a door once, right? Didn't we? Like...
Cyrus Schwert 00:48:48 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:58 Yeah. Absorption. The only magic. Hmm. Well, I suppose we should be careful. There is an abjuration or around this. I'd hate for us to lose our power. Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:48:59 Yeah. Abjuration is the school of magic that deals with protective magic, shielding magic, and, like, stealing magic. Has to do with, like, containment and protection.
Cletus Cobbington 00:49:22 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:28 I don't have anything good. Yeah, let's do it. Yeah, everybody take turns. What could go wrong?
Kaladen Shash 00:49:30 You guys, what do we worry about? The plaque says do it, you get a good favor. Like, let's just crack the chains, right?
Cyrus Schwert 00:49:39 Lots of stuff.
Leopold Magnus 00:49:43 I could cast an unseen servant and make him do it. You know, I think it just can do general housework. Maybe I'll give him a pair of bolt cutters.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:59 Is your Unseen Servant capable of breaking magic locks? There you go.
Kaladen Shash 00:50:00 I don't think they can attack anything.
Dungeon Master 00:50:00 How much weight? Nice. This is what I would call
Cletus Cobbington 00:50:05 Oh. I might be able to try something, actually. I want to cast Dispel Magic.
Leopold Magnus 00:50:22 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:50:30 a role that requires a huge success to be successful, a very high role. Above the table, DC25. Anybody who assists him in the standard way of I just want to give him help is adding a plus two to the role. If you want to do something else, let me know if you're trying to be a little bit creative about it. We can talk in terms of advantage versus not.
Kaladen Shash 00:50:40 I will assist him. Great.
Zariel Torgan 00:50:43 Damn. Could I?
Dungeon Master 00:51:00 or anything else like that, but I would need to know what you're doing ahead of time. I would say that'd be the same as just like a normal aiding action. So that would just be plus two.
Leopold Magnus 00:51:06 It does smell good.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:09 Oh, I was just going to say I have that spell, but I don't have it learned. Could I just burn a slot to try to help somehow just like give him some of my energy or like a third level spot? I can do that.
Kaladen Shash 00:51:24 Well, thanks.
Cletus Cobbington 00:51:24 You.
Leopold Magnus 00:51:34 I guess, like, this spell magic in the game, like, how does that work? Does it, like, shift the magic somewhere else, or does it just evaporate into the air? Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:51:45 It just undoes it. It untethers the arcane hole that keeps it together. Permanently disenchant things.
Kaladen Shash 00:51:54 I'll also offer assistance for giving guidance with my wizard knowledge. Excellent.
Cletus Cobbington 00:52:07 What kind of roll do I do? Let's see. Cool. What kind of, what do I roll for it? Just d20? Make the mobility check. Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:07 I was just thinking about...
Cyrus Schwert 00:52:12 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:12 Oh shit. I might just guide him rather than doing that. Cause then he gets a plus D four.
Dungeon Master 00:52:19 There we go. You are making an ability check using your spellcasting modifier. So I think it's like a plus 7, 8, or 9 or something, depending on what your scores are.
Dungeon Master 00:52:41 You have a plus two from Kaladin and Leopold, and you have a D4 from Zariel. Is Cyrus going to contribute in any way? No, not his modifier, no. You could do a Bardic, or you could do... Offen.
Cletus Cobbington 00:52:49 Yes.
Cyrus Schwert 00:52:51 Enhance Ability wouldn't really touch his spell casting modifier, right? OK. And Bless is only saving throws. Yeah, I'll just do a Bardic. That sounds good. I give him a shoulder massage. I've done it differently every time.
Dungeon Master 00:53:10 This is the first time I think... Oh, there we go. I was going to ask, how does Cyrus' Bardic sort of manifest? Just a nice firm trap. I love it. Okay. Cletus, go ahead and roll me the ability check using your spellcasting modifier. Add plus four, plus a d4, and plus whatever the Bardic is from Cyrus. That's a d8.
Cletus Cobbington 00:53:20 Plus 1d4 plus 1d8. OK. OK.
Cyrus Schwert 00:53:21 Not super consistent. It's a D8. I'll make sure. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:39 Nice. You got it. Come on. Nice. Nice. That's pretty good. That might be the highest roll yet.
Cletus Cobbington 00:53:49 We're going to that not as easy. Okay. Boom. Oh, it rolled right off the 20. 30, 30. I think since I'm so in tune with
Leopold Magnus 00:53:51 Let's go. That's still pretty good.
Dungeon Master 00:54:02 Ooh, 30, 30. How does, that's the, yeah. How does Cletus' magic, like, visualize?
Cyrus Schwert 00:54:07 That's really good on those two.
Kaladen Shash 00:54:10 the best check yet. Splash. He just throws almond milk. Splash.
Cletus Cobbington 00:54:20 Yeah, I cleanse my hands with almond milk, dunk them in the mug. No, I think it's, since I'm so in tune with nature, it kind of like manifests as like windowing vines, like spiritual vines going towards the chain, like wrapping around it.
Dungeon Master 00:54:43 Nice. You see the lock sitting on the gemstone sculpture has these ore coming off and these vines come out of like invisible crevices and cracks. They almost seem like they're growing out of something, wrapping around and through and down the chain. And you see the lock is covered at one point as like the vines almost seem like they start siphoning the energy and this aura that's coming off of it gets smaller and smaller and smaller. And then you stop feeling the presence of the magic.
Dungeon Master 00:55:14 As eventually you feel and maybe even hear just like this very sharp crack as the magic seems to break hold and the lock almost seems like it gets heavier and it just like lays somehow more flat against the sculpture. Now it just seems you have to break the lock as you have successfully dispelled the magic. You see that what you hadn't seen before is there's this large sort of
Cletus Cobbington 00:55:39 you you
Dungeon Master 00:55:43 glyph that is what makes this clearing and as the magic dispels it's almost like step one has been accomplished you see these not lit up but established inscribed in runes that form this you know 20 um 20 foot radius on this circle the gemstones that grow out of the ground seem to be key points in it everything's sort of like
Dungeon Master 00:56:10 exaggerates like the crack the the ground almost cracks in very specific ways and you guys are standing in this huge ritual circle
Cletus Cobbington 00:56:18 first time did the trick
Zariel Torgan 00:56:21 So before we... Oh yeah, definitely. Way to go. If this thing only grants a boon to whoever breaks it, maybe we should pick somebody who gets it. I don't know if there's somebody that hasn't gotten something cool in a little bit. I know I just got something cool, so it wouldn't be me. I don't know if we want to talk about that. Just in case.
Leopold Magnus 00:56:22 Cletus, good job.
Cletus Cobbington 00:56:52 I love me most animals, but I've learned to really hate these scaly fuckers. I do not want a dragon boon. And the off chance I turn into a dragon, I do not want that.
Zariel Torgan 00:56:59 just retching the whole time you're in wagon form this is awful
Kaladen Shash 00:57:01 Dragon bone Yeah, I feel like I'm I feel like I've got some pretty good attunables or I Don't know what the bone would be but
Leopold Magnus 00:57:09 turn into a dragon. Yeah, that's a good point. I'm flexible. I figured I'd
Dungeon Master 00:57:29 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:57:32 I move, I move like...
Leopold Magnus 00:57:36 I was going to say, I think the next step is to slice this lock up with the saber. Yeah, go for it. All right. Yes. My hilts, I'll...
Cletus Cobbington 00:57:42 You got the saber. I say send it. I'm so big, but I hide behind Zariel.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:50 Yeah, I say let's do it. Let's see what happens. I'm going to take 10 steps back.
Leopold Magnus 00:57:59 I'll pull the saber and activate it, and I'll walk up and slash the lock.
Dungeon Master 00:58:09 as it turns on flies through perfectly spacing it you cut through the lock give me a sleight of hand check to effectively cut through the lock without damaging the statue
Cletus Cobbington 00:58:13 God.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:33 That would be pretty sweet.
Leopold Magnus 00:58:33 Sleight of hand. I was going to say, my sleight of hand is not super. Okay. All right, 2d4.
Kaladen Shash 00:58:38 It's like I got a plus you gotta get a plus d4 It's on stack would be oh so oped It's rad who else did that go to
Dungeon Master 00:58:38 So you have guidance, you've got that d4. Guidance doesn't stack. Mm-hmm. Normally blood doesn't stack on this, but
Cletus Cobbington 00:58:44 Can I also use guidance on them or can you not stack that? Does Bless stack? No, I'm kidding.
Cyrus Schwert 00:58:53 Can I cast Bless? I'll cast Bless to get an extra d4.
Dungeon Master 00:59:09 Because it's also an attack roll, it'll work. Okay. So 13 plus 3 is 16. It was a DC 15 on this one. Just making it cut through. And for those who are well-versed, and Kaladin would even know this, in Fey Magic...
Leopold Magnus 00:59:09 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:59:25 Oof.
Cletus Cobbington 00:59:25 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:59:36 Iron is a bad thing. It's like an omen. It's disenchanting. It's manufactured. It defies the definition of nature and wildness. It's not a magic lock in itself. There was an enchantment portion that has been dispelled, and that was very powerful, but
Leopold Magnus 00:59:48 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:59:56 This is just an iron chain lock, and you cut through it, and with a heavy rattle, the chains slowly consolidate and hit the floor and gather together near that classic chain clinking sound. Once the statue is by itself and the chains are off, you hear the ground start to crack out from underneath you. The runes ignite, and the whole circle almost catches fire with this purple flame.
Cletus Cobbington 01:00:08 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:00:26 this ground feels unstable and you all have the instinct to run and clear it does anybody not want to do that for whatever reason sort of it is if the whole thing is a circle and the pedestal is in the center the entire ruined area that you're standing in seems like it's about to give out from underneath your feet
Kaladen Shash 01:00:38 Stay within the circle, like the pedestal where the dragon statue is. Is that what you're describing? Cave into the ground.
Cletus Cobbington 01:00:43 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:01:00 I'll stay. Yeah, after
Zariel Torgan 01:01:00 Yeah, I'll move to the edge right at the very farthest point without getting off to where if it does fall, I have a chance to jump. Yeah, I wasn't scared at all.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:10 I like this idea a lot. Yes. Oh, even better. I'll stand my ground. I'm a hero. Adventure.
Dungeon Master 01:01:11 Yes. Okay. You've got a feather fall. Two people standing in the circle, but towards the edge. Leopold and Cletus. Yes.
Cyrus Schwert 01:01:13 Can I prepare a reaction to cast Feather Fall if I think we need it?
Cletus Cobbington 01:01:14 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:01:39 got a good feeling i'm gonna i'm gonna take a kneel i free i've unshackled the dragon i'm just gonna kneel and uh wait to see what happens a wide saving throw dex like seriously
Dungeon Master 01:01:43 Take a kneel. Okay. On the edge. Everybody give me a dexterity saving throw. Dexterity saving throw. Blesses.
Cyrus Schwert 01:01:44 You're so much bigger. Me.
Cletus Cobbington 01:01:49 I did say I was hiding behind Zariel, so I'll just go next to him now.
Zariel Torgan 01:01:49 T-Bone it. Good call.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:04 Who else was on that Bless? You get more targets. You have to pick and choose there. Would you say a deck save?
Leopold Magnus 01:02:10 I think I was right. So we all get
Dungeon Master 01:02:12 Oh, great. If bless is not guidance, who all did you give bless to? Dex safe.
Cyrus Schwert 01:02:19 Oh, I guess there's three people. Okay. There you go.
Cletus Cobbington 01:02:27 Well, I casted it also, so you put it on three, and I'll put it on the other three. So we all have fly. We all have it, yeah. D4.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:39 Bless. Nice. 23.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:43 Plus a plus four. God damn you guys. I got 11.
Dungeon Master 01:02:46 Yep, the deep war. 17. Okay. So only one person is above 20 at this point? Or two people, Kaladin and Leopold? Okay. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:47 Yeah. You got the 25. No. Yes.
Cyrus Schwert 01:02:54 That's 17. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:02:58 I'm sorry, direct saving through or direct, yeah. Yes, plus a d4.
Leopold Magnus 01:03:10 Yep. We happen to be the ones in the circle.
Kaladen Shash 01:03:17 I'm in the circle, but closer to the edge. No, no, no. I said I was going to stay in the middle because I'm a hero waiting for Feather Fall.
Dungeon Master 01:03:25 Um,
Cyrus Schwert 01:03:26 Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:03:31 unsure of yourselves of why you decided to stay in this very volatile place. Everything goes bullet time as the ground uniformly caves out about six inches and then an enormous beam of purple energy ejects from the ground. Everybody within the circle radius is ejected 30, 40, 50 feet back, thrown through the air like ragdolls. If you got underneath 20 feet,
Cletus Cobbington 01:03:37 Oh, fuck. Oh. Oh my fuck.
Kaladen Shash 01:03:57 Feather fall. What was it? What did you say it was? 64? What was it? All right. Check, check, check.
Dungeon Master 01:04:02 you take 66 points of force damage if you save which is dc 20 and higher you take half of that 66 points of damage if you failed 33 on a success um
Cletus Cobbington 01:04:07 we're fucking dead fuck I knew I hated fucking dragons
Cyrus Schwert 01:04:11 Does Feather Fall help?
Leopold Magnus 01:04:11 6D6.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:26 Ha ha.
Kaladen Shash 01:04:27 It's like, why do we keep
Dungeon Master 01:04:28 The people on the very edge of the circle are just shot straight lines back, but, like, Kaladin and Leopold and I think maybe Cyrus too are thrown, like, in the air and back, just flailing as, like, you have, like, this...
Dungeon Master 01:04:47 theme coming off of your body. It's like the friction increased so fast that the water evaporated as you were hit with that force. As you're laying on the ground, ass over tea kettle, wondering what the fuck just happened, you see as this beam shoots into the sky, they're not physical forms, but almost energy forms and spiritual. You see these dragons of beautiful, glittering green
Dungeon Master 01:05:16 deep purples and blues and reds and opalescent iridescent shines as these dragons just eject out of the ground as if they were in some spectral prison and disperse in a rainbow into the sky as this huge wave of rainbow just dissipates into the clouds, disappearing. Everybody gets once per day a shield.
Dungeon Master 01:05:44 Separate from any spells, you just have a shield ability as you get the Blessing of the Gemstone Drakes. That is just an ability you gain. Yeah, for one round.
Kaladen Shash 01:05:47 Oh, cool. Is that an object, or we just keep track of that every day? Blessing of the gems done great. One round reaction. It really is.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:54 Oh, yeah. This shield stack.
Cyrus Schwert 01:06:02 So that's just choosing the 5 to AC for one reaction. OK. That's fucking awesome. Let's fucking go with that.
Zariel Torgan 01:06:12 That's pretty substantial.
Kaladen Shash 01:06:20 No.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:27 So Leopold gets flung, you know, 40 feet in the air, lands, arms, legs, everything go flying. Just a torso. Oh, dear. A little help here. I'm jumping around on one leg, trying to grab my arm.
Cletus Cobbington 01:06:28 No.
Dungeon Master 01:06:32 Everything goes flying and dispersing. You dent a tree and the bark tears off as you go spinning into the forest. I think you all have over 66 HP base.
Cyrus Schwert 01:06:42 Are any of us dead? I'm at like four health. Oh my god. Yeah, that's true. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:06:52 I would have much less if I hadn't gotten half damage.
Cletus Cobbington 01:07:00 Yeah, I'm at nine damage or nine health. These dragons do this, do we, every time. I check myself for scales. Do I have any scales?
Zariel Torgan 01:07:10 When will we learn?
Cyrus Schwert 01:07:12 The only thing here is mean giant lizards. I thought it was supposed to be nice. This is so fucked.
Dungeon Master 01:07:22 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:07:26 But that was after quite a bit of travel, and you guys gather yourselves together, sort of talking about what the fuck just happened, and maybe why did we stand on this circle if it seems so hostile. But you sort of trek back into the jungle on your continued path, and as it hits nightfall, you guys have successfully completed essentially the two days' travel on the one day. As you bed down for the night, the next day will be...
Cletus Cobbington 01:07:39 Hmm. All up.
Dungeon Master 01:07:56 your, what would be the fourth of seven day with a little bit of delay. You've got three days left, but anybody want to do anything as you're sort of getting ready for the night? Yeah. Okay. So remind me how many successes did you have before you had back-to-back failures?
Kaladen Shash 01:08:07 Yeah, can I try to try to enchant this ring? It's going so poorly. I think I had over three sounds up to like 16 hours we had said, I'm assuming that was like three efforts.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:15 It's bound to go well. Let me give you guidance.
Cyrus Schwert 01:08:17 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:19 Yeah. Starting to think you're
Cletus Cobbington 01:08:24 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:08:37 And then two fails. I'm really a pretty good wizard.
Dungeon Master 01:08:45 Let's see here.
Cyrus Schwert 01:08:46 I'll go up to Kaladin and say, I'm tired of watching you just blow up in your face. It's really demoralizing for the whole squad. I feel like I cast Enhance Ability on them. Cast Enhance Ability, and then I forget what kind of check it is. Is it Wisdom? OK.
Kaladen Shash 01:09:08 It's going to be an intelligence-based check, like Arcana. Is sensibility advantage? Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:09:16 Enhanceability on you for intelligence checks. For the next hour. It is. The check's not saving throws. If it's a saving throw, then fuck. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:09:27 Okay. No, it's just an Arcana check, really. Calvin, this will be your last check as you will have completed the time requirements and the ability check requirements on a success here, and you'll finish your item at this point.
Kaladen Shash 01:09:42 All right, I will roll this with advantage. We're okay, we're okay, 27.
Dungeon Master 01:09:58 if you succeed. 27. As you painstakingly, carefully etch the runes along the inside and the outside of the ring, your scribing meets up with the back of the last one. And as the line sort of brushes the metal,
Dungeon Master 01:10:27 And it scrapes it off, and the lines connect. A flash of gold as you feel the magic take hold finally. You've been concentrated as you etch the process of enchanting, as you channel your magic into the runes as it goes. So you spent 32 hours fueling this ring to hold a charge. You are successful. Now, I don't remember, was this just a normal ring of protection you were going for?
Kaladen Shash 01:10:40 Yeah, that's what we had talked about because when I had started three weeks ago, forever, that's just what we had decided.
Kaladen Shash 01:11:07 was going to be like a good entry point so yeah it's just it's just a regular ringer protection but that was like the three yeah that's that's the best part about it yeah forever
Dungeon Master 01:11:08 OK. Since you created this item, you can name it whatever you want, but it follows the benefits of a standard ring of protection. Plus one to all saves, plus one to your armor class.
Cyrus Schwert 01:11:11 It's been like 10 days in in-game time. That's so long. It's blowing up.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:36 awesome i would like oh yeah i was just yeah yeah um i so i want to try something here um
Cletus Cobbington 01:11:38 I need some jewelry on myself.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:51 So I guess we have an evening. Sounds like, sorry, I'll go ahead.
Dungeon Master 01:11:54 Yeah. You've trained them enough of me. You've done like I think sit in like heal or your first commands, right? So they can obey sit commands.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:03 I want to gather up the pups outside and have them sitting in front of me, if they can sit. And I'm going to cast... Yeah. Okay, so I'm going to sit them down and give them some snacks, and then I'm going to cast Greater Restoration on myself.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:34 And see if they turn on me. I am. You know, that's a good point. Let me check. I know we got a bunch of diamonds and stuff.
Dungeon Master 01:12:40 you are curing yourself of lycanthropy? Is there a diamond requirement or something on that spell? You've got a huge stash of gems. We can say you can take that value out of one singular gem if you need to.
Cyrus Schwert 01:12:53 you you
Zariel Torgan 01:13:03 Well, I suppose... Hang on. Before I do that, I suppose I should probably talk to the group, because I didn't exactly ask to spend all that money. Let me check. Uh... So, a hundred gold pieces worth of diamond dust. So...
Dungeon Master 01:13:09 Communication is nice. You guys don't talk to each other a lot. Cool. So you just need to subtract 100 golds worth of diamond, and Leopold can in no time at all craft a jeweler's kit out of his general tools, and he can grind up the diamonds.
Kaladen Shash 01:13:12 Yes. They're grinding up.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:33 All right, yeah, because I've got 2,500 gold worth of stuff. All right, so I'll mark that off real quick. Hey, Leo, could you grind this up for me?
Leopold Magnus 01:13:34 Do it. Oh, yes, of course. I grab my little jeweler's eyeglass and I start looking at it really carefully. And then I just toss it in my mouth. And you hear this kind of...
Leopold Magnus 01:14:03 And yeah, out the back side comes some powder. Well, here you go, Zario. And I just kind of plop it down in his hands.
Cletus Cobbington 01:14:07 Oh no. Beggars can't be choosers around here.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:15 Well, I wish that would have gone differently, but. Oh, well. That's 100 percent true. Yeah. All right. Thank you. And yeah, I'll go back over and. Give the old college try.
Kaladen Shash 01:14:19 Yeah, sure.
Dungeon Master 01:14:37 Okay. You sit down in front of these two wolves who are very patiently, obediently waiting for their next command. And they are like timber wolf size. They are huffs of dire wolves, as far as you can tell, with the exaggerated features of having werewolf blood.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:53 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:14:59 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:15:04 It's kind of weird that den mother that you had found had reverted to, which is a very large dire wolf when you would slain her. So they've got this very intense look. And when you're watching them from the front, you just have like the blackness of their, the black brownness of their eyes as they just stare intently at you. You sit down and you've got this diamond dust in your palms and you start
Dungeon Master 01:15:27 you know, in the normal Zario fashion, your hands start to get warm and ignite with flame and you start burning up the dust and the smoke wafts up and around and then into your nostrils and you breathe in and you absorb it and you feel this tearing of your soul as the magic binds to your energy and separates the blood of the werewolf out of you. And you guys watching it, you see Zario kind of goes limp for a second and then again, he's
Dungeon Master 01:15:56 a robot, right? He looks like Ultron. His form exaggerates as his head wrenches back and his mouth elongates to his snout for a second and then it kind of half transforms back as he lets out a pained scream. And then with a large howl
Dungeon Master 01:16:14 you see his body sort of relaxes and everything sort of disperses and this wave of red energy kind of escapes from him. And while they don't turn on you, you see it's almost like the wolves snap out of a trance they're in. They no longer feel like a connection or need to obey. So they just sort of, you see they get up and they, as like a dog, the dog thing to do where they kind of backpedal a little bit
Dungeon Master 01:16:42 And they check their surroundings, seeing if there's an escape point. But because they're not immediately under threat and because this is like a safe, warm space, they haven't outright fled.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:57 All right, I'm going to do the classic, you know, broken family thing where you try to get them to come one way or go the other way. And so I'm going to try to, like, see if they want to come with me or if they'd rather, like, go into the forest. So I'm not going to get any meat or anything, but, like, all right, now. You want to come here or, you know, see what they want to do.
Kaladen Shash 01:17:07 You.
Cyrus Schwert 01:17:10 Gary, come home.
Cletus Cobbington 01:17:27 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:17:29 they do the dog thing where like the head kind of bows down below the shoulder line is they almost get like a level look at you. Um, and you see very hesitantly, they step forward and almost maybe conveniently timed. There is like the release and scent of the snake perfume, uh, not state snake steak perfume from behind you as, um, they still associate you with protectiveness, um,
Kaladen Shash 01:17:49 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:17:58 food water things like that so they you see but it's more there was a weird sense of like forced family bond before now this is purely like owner pet relationship built only on the trust as long as both parties agree upon it you don't feel like they there's a need for them to obey you now
Zariel Torgan 01:18:25 Gotcha. I'm just going to I'm going to have a little old grease tear. I'm down with your oil. I'm going to give Leo a hug. Thank you that that that feeder really helped. Yeah, I mean, I don't even like him that much, but I mean, he stayed, which is cool.
Cyrus Schwert 01:18:30 It's really desperate.
Cletus Cobbington 01:18:31 Oh, God. I don't think that was just pouring tears.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:40 Oh, yes, of course. Anytime. I love tinkering and things.
Kaladen Shash 01:18:53 Do you have oil leaking? Do you have oil leaking down your face right now? Yep. Finally. Breakthrough.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:59 It's nothing. I'm malfunctioning. I'll fix it. It's fine. Yeah. That's what it is. Yeah. Anyway, what else are you guys doing in that? That's all I got.
Cletus Cobbington 01:19:02 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:19:03 Okay, now...
Cyrus Schwert 01:19:03 You're really proud that your kidnapped kids have Stockholm syndrome. It's inappropriate.
Leopold Magnus 01:19:22 I was going to work on upgrading the armor of Bone Crusher some more in the meantime.
Dungeon Master 01:19:32 You had started working on just increasing the armor class, but then you got the black dragon hide and you immediately pivoted doing something with that. What's the new sort of goal for this armor?
Leopold Magnus 01:19:48 Yeah, so taking the dragon hide, what I'm trying to do is to forge its scales into the armor plates of Bone Crusher. So I'm trying to meld the steel of Bone Crusher with the hide of the dragon to increase its resistance and robustness. So I guess the end goal is still just upping its armor class, but I thought that this dragon scale might be a good crafting material for that.
Dungeon Master 01:20:15 and it have like innate abilities attached to it now this as we're sort of still following the enchantment bare bones guide i'm gonna still implement the same rule where anytime you try to add multiple things to the same object the dc gets much harder so this is going to be the equivalent of like a third fourth level spell instead of a dc 18 this is now a dc 22
Dungeon Master 01:20:41 And you'll need to do 48 hours invested into this in-game time with six successful checks before you have six failures.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:41 Okay. Oh, for fuck's sake. 15, baby. Yeah. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:20:56 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:21:01 Plus 13.
Kaladen Shash 01:21:06 I should have had it. Tough. Okay. I was back.
Leopold Magnus 01:21:09 I should have. Yeah, but when you roll a two, it doesn't help.
Dungeon Master 01:21:11 I think technically it's counted as a failure, but as far as like how it plays out in the workshop, as everybody's sort of doing their own thing, I think night one, you just sort of, you have this really brilliant idea of,
Dungeon Master 01:21:26 that would be easier to do because you have a material instead of like the problem before was that you didn't have extra steel. You'd have to take from yourself to give to your steel defender. So like, you're like, Oh, let me just transition this. But the first night I think is Leopold hunched over like a blueprint diagram that you're like writing up and you're like, how the fuck do I forge skin to steel? And that is your entire night is being hit with like this engineer block of how do you make this work?
Kaladen Shash 01:21:53 Because I saw him in my dream. I didn't tell him I see
Dungeon Master 01:21:57 Technically a fail. Story-wise, this is just you working out how to get started on the whole project. Anybody else doing anything with their nights?
Leopold Magnus 01:22:04 Well,
Cletus Cobbington 01:22:11 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:22:13 Cyrus is a little too tuckered out from tickets. Oh yes. Nevermind. No, I, um, I I'm from the sweets district. Um, I guess.
Kaladen Shash 01:22:23 Say, Cyrus, what do you used to do? You're not always farmhand. What do you do? You told me this last time.
Cyrus Schwert 01:22:40 I was a student for a while. I'm not like super old or anything. Yeah, I don't know. We just fuck around in school, you know, wait for it to be over. It's not what I wanted to be doing. My family? Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:22:43 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:22:59 Do you know very much about your family? Yes. I asked this question. I asked the question because in my dream I met up with this
Cletus Cobbington 01:23:07 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:23:11 I mean, my family's not big, they're kind of creative types, stories, art, that kind of thing.
Kaladen Shash 01:23:28 preacher a being of some sort that is my great great great uncle right you can only see dreams of people he's connected to and he could see you i saw your dream and you were reading an old tome i don't know like school or some sort
Cyrus Schwert 01:23:46 Yeah. Where was I? That was my dream last night. I mean, things like it, for sure. I don't remember if it was exactly that,
Kaladen Shash 01:24:02 Have you done that in the past or do you just dream that? Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:24:18 if like seeing the death tree was a omen or not, that kind of like brought that back or, I don't know, that's been a while. I'm nervous about this tree though, for sure. No, I mean, it's called the death tree. So, or tree of death, one of the two.
Kaladen Shash 01:24:33 Yes, looking over your shoulder, it doesn't sound great. Yeah, we're going to go check it out. I feel like we're going to go see what that is. Yeah, they're first. They're first.
Cyrus Schwert 01:24:47 So it can't be good getting closer to it. I thought we were going to a dome. OK. I feel like that's an assumption, but probably warranted from storytelling.
Kaladen Shash 01:25:03 Next adventure. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:25:11 Well, Cyrus, if this tree's really freaking you out, we could probably find a logger at Cottonwood to take it down. Oh, no, no, like a forest, forest beaver, you know? Oh. Did Cornelius wreck?
Cletus Cobbington 01:25:20 So.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:20 Beaver.
Cyrus Schwert 01:25:21 A lager like a beer? I know this guy, Craig. I know a beaver folk named Craig. He got hella pussy in college. Yeah. Yeah, he's a good guy.
Dungeon Master 01:25:35 He's like a fucking buff beaver that carries around like a chopping axe. He's like, give me a fucking chew on that.
Leopold Magnus 01:25:40 Cornelius recommended him yeah
Zariel Torgan 01:25:44 I like to imagine a beaver from that place would be offended if you wanted him to chew down a tree. He's like, I got a fucking chainsaw, dude. What do you think I am? I'm bipedal, come on. Yeah. I'm going to bite this thing? I'm sentient.
Kaladen Shash 01:25:49 What's happening? Because I'll driven up with his questions.
Cletus Cobbington 01:25:55 you you
Dungeon Master 01:26:20 Nice. Talk a little bit about it. Zario. Partway through the night. I don't think he does. He has his headphones on. It's a great time for him to walk away. Anyway, he's going to get a sending spell sent to him. Can somebody give me a word count as I do it? I get 25 words and I haven't pre-planned it. So we'll see how much comes out of it.
Kaladen Shash 01:26:23 you you
Cletus Cobbington 01:26:36 you
Cyrus Schwert 01:26:39 Good. Yeah, so much, dude.
Dungeon Master 01:26:51 But now we have to wait for Jesse. He walked away. So how's everybody doing? I've been getting out.
Kaladen Shash 01:26:57 pretty good anyone else really missing disc golf i was like i was like thinking about i was like yeah we got so we got so spoiled in january like how are you fighting your disc it's just it's just muddy now
Leopold Magnus 01:27:03 oh man need to get out there played a lot oh no
Cyrus Schwert 01:27:15 I played every day.
Dungeon Master 01:27:18 I've still been going out. I just take two discs with me that I don't care about losing. And then, unfortunately, I lost my brand new Valkyrie, like I said. But then I went back out and played with one of my old discs and somebody found it for me the next day. I pretty much always lose it by the end because it just buries in the snow and you can't find it. But I'm still only down one disc.
Cletus Cobbington 01:27:32 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:27:37 yeah so i was watching these i was watching these guys play in like michigan no plain snow but they like super glue a ribbon on the bottom of the disc and they throw it and then that like when it hits the ground the ribbon is still like visible so people have figured that out
Leopold Magnus 01:27:50 Uh...
Cyrus Schwert 01:27:53 that's interesting I've been practicing backhands with Winston in the park right
Dungeon Master 01:27:59 Oh, nice. Jesse, you were going to get a message sent to you in the middle of, as you went to bed, but you walked away right then. Okay, you're forgiven. You get a sending spell.
Kaladen Shash 01:28:08 Oh, wow. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:13 Oh, sorry. I had a cat that was eating a stick of butter, so I had to go... Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:28:23 next time bring the camera
Dungeon Master 01:28:29 So, at whatever point in the night that this is for Zariel, at some point, intrusively entering your head, you hear a familiar sort of bassy voice of the man you know to be the Lord Marshal Thur. In the gritty tone, as it comes through all at once, you hear, Zariel, I no longer sense you
Dungeon Master 01:28:58 in the same way. You've left my blood. You still have my daughter's children. I beg for you to bring them back to me. I can't lose anymore. What is he at, Travis?
Kaladen Shash 01:29:13 you
Cyrus Schwert 01:29:25 That was like 35. I beg you. I think daughter was the last one. The last one within 25. Just so we're clear.
Dungeon Master 01:29:27 Okay, so whatever 25 is, is the cutoff. So he's just talking, but eventually... Okay. So you hear, you still have my daughters, and then nothing. And you have 25 words to respond with.
Zariel Torgan 01:29:51 Are the puppies, are they boy or girl? I never really checked. Oh. They're both women.
Dungeon Master 01:30:03 I don't I never decided you can decide one of each boy girl sure yeah you got a couple of bitches you know
Cyrus Schwert 01:30:03 Oh, that's interesting. These are not girls.
Kaladen Shash 01:30:04 one of each
Cletus Cobbington 01:30:14 women horrible no beautiful grown mature women okay
Leopold Magnus 01:30:14 You have women dogs.
Zariel Torgan 01:30:23 Yeah. They're girl dogs. Well, you know, I want to be respectful. Yeah, yeah. So I got 25 words to respond. So I assume he's talking about when he says, you still have my daughter's
Cyrus Schwert 01:30:32 They're ladies.
Dungeon Master 01:30:45 It's unfortunate that he said daughters, pups, and all you hear is daughters, which reinforces your misunderstanding that they were his pups. He knew that you
Zariel Torgan 01:30:54 Yeah. So did I tell him before that I had his pups? Because I didn't think. Oh, he did. OK. I didn't remember. OK. All right. I don't want to respond to that. I got to focus on the get them back part. Somebody going to count these for me? I'll start. All right.
Cletus Cobbington 01:30:54 um
Kaladen Shash 01:31:02 you you
Cyrus Schwert 01:31:18 Sure. That's 25.
Zariel Torgan 01:31:24 Have you still ransacked the city? Why should I return this to you? What's in it for us? Also, their names are Snowball and Coco. Ah, damn it! Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:31:44 Also there, I think is where it is. Oh, that was it? Snowball and Cocoa? Okay. I was five off. It takes a moment before eventually... Sorry, what was your whole thing again? I was focusing on the word count. I know the names and... Yeah, that's
Cyrus Schwert 01:31:49 Yeah. He asked a question.
Zariel Torgan 01:32:06 Oh, yeah, I was just asking, like, why, like, what, so are you still, like, controlling the town? And what's in it for me to bring them back? Yeah, what's in it for us, basically?
Dungeon Master 01:32:12 Ransack the city. What's the end of the brain back? Again, there's the long break. And then he responds into your head again. The dome takes from us.
Kaladen Shash 01:32:30 you
Cletus Cobbington 01:32:33 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:32:40 less fortunate than the others. When she died, I was enraged and lost sight of the goal. Fighting has ceased, but you will not be returning to the same city you left. That's it.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:11 I'll respond. Pretty vague. We've got a mission. Gotta finish. We'll be back later. They might like me more when we get back. What do I want to say? The last three words. Um...
Kaladen Shash 01:33:16 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:33:20 That's it. 22. Fuck you, man.
Cletus Cobbington 01:33:41 I love you.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:43 What's left? I'll just say no. They lack me. I'll leave it at that.
Dungeon Master 01:33:45 What do I say? Okay. And you wait a bit, but there's no response. You think that maybe you've given, by confirming things, some thought over the matter.
Kaladen Shash 01:33:46 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:33:56 Is that it?
Dungeon Master 01:34:14 But then you guys complete your long rest. No other weird shenanigans happens in the night. No watches need to be taken anymore because you have the protection of the dome. So as you guys come to, feeling well-rested, you have... This will be the three-day that can be reduced on a good roll. But you are nearing where you assume to be Moonhaven.
Zariel Torgan 01:34:18 Peace.
Cletus Cobbington 01:34:51 All right. I'll do a survival. Oh, fuck me.
Dungeon Master 01:34:51 Somebody give me a survival check and an encounter check. And then we'll take a quick break. I'm going to get some inhaled inspiration. Natural one.
Cyrus Schwert 01:35:06 Arctic or otherwise. You got something, Nolan? All right. Unbelievable. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:35:13 Latest. Natural one. We lose a day again. My goodness. How old is this? It's just D20. You know, we're looking for the pair. Here we go. Pair of ones. Snake.
Cletus Cobbington 01:35:22 Just kill my character. I'm so angry. God damn it.
Dungeon Master 01:35:22 Give me an encounter check. Make eyes.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:25 Oh, shit. This better be a one. You're going to leave us right to a dragon. That's pretty good.
Cyrus Schwert 01:35:33 Six T-Rexes. Snake eyes. It's actually crazy how many ones we've rolled. It's destroyed my 20.
Kaladen Shash 01:35:40 Snake eyes. Oh, that's not bad. Well.
Dungeon Master 01:35:55 It's tough how bad you can do it. You don't backtrack, but you get a little lost. But as you guys are moving...
Zariel Torgan 01:35:55 I've rolled two of the ones. So we've had at least three.
Cyrus Schwert 01:36:04 destroyed Cyrus's 20 from the day before, just walked right back.
Cletus Cobbington 01:36:09 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:36:19 This is how we'll play it because the encounter check did roll for something fun too. As you guys are making your way through this sort of denser to less dense area of the forces, you sort of try to meander your way north. A few hours into your trek, you start hearing way above the canopy, like flapping of heavy wings, but it's so brief and quick that it's just like something passes over by. Don't ever get a good look and you move on.
Zariel Torgan 01:36:29 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:36:47 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:36:49 Half hour later, same thing. Heavy beats of wings sort of come across a different direction, casting a shadow as if it's lower. As you guys are moving another couple hours, you hear at one point a loud screech through the air as it goes through. But nothing happens. And it's not until you guys eventually...
Dungeon Master 01:37:14 are coming down this path and you hear the large sort of sound of something landing into the trees in the canopy. And you see like, you can almost hear when large trees start swaying aggressively as something hits them. It's like the huge swinging of all of the leaves and branches rustling and moving and large birds squawk as they all fly away. And there's like a max exodus of the wildlife.
Dungeon Master 01:37:41 As you guys come into this space, everybody give me a perception check. 15, 13, 18. Leave them.
Kaladen Shash 01:37:57 Let's go.
Dungeon Master 01:38:10 And there's another plus 25 perception check from Zariel. Everybody sees the first part, but Zariel's the one who sees the second part. As you're walking down this established game trail, almost as if you were guided without being known, it sort of funnels into a dense tree line, and you see landing in front of you
Cletus Cobbington 01:38:27 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:38:37 Like a three-point superhero landing, as epic as it can be, just this thud as you see this enlarged, engrossed, hyena-looking humanoid with a sick intelligence to its face. It has this enormous sort of Final Fantasy-style cleaver on its back.
Dungeon Master 01:39:02 With like loose leather and metal worked armor. As... Let's see if it sends the picture. This large creature hits the ground snarling and looking at you. Zariel, everybody fixates on this. But your just general sense of nature and animals. Up sort of still in the tree line. Attached to a tree. You see this large creature.
Cletus Cobbington 01:39:12 Jesus.
Dungeon Master 01:39:30 wyvern just sort of perched on a tree waiting to be commanded to come back down um it's got like pretty primitive but very obvious like saddle and harness gear as if it's the mount for this guy he hits the ground he snarls and he goes well i reckon it's about time i found your tracks snarl spits and he goes
Dungeon Master 01:40:00 I've been tracking you since you left Cottonwood. You left my army in shambles. You left my leader dead. And you see on his chest, he had like an emblazoned ironed in like symbol of a firebird on his chest. He goes, you didn't think I'd let that go so fast, did you?
Dungeon Master 01:40:27 You think you can just run into the forest and escape? I know this ends here for honor. He goes for enjoyment and his huge sword comes down and he hits the ground with a dull thud and he sort of gets punched down. But like there is intelligence to him and he,
Cyrus Schwert 01:40:30 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:40:39 We were...
Dungeon Master 01:40:52 To Leopold's unfortunateness, this is in Sylvan, the sort of spoken language of all the woodland folk. And you would know that this figure was hinted at before by Elder Pyre Tongue when you were on the mountain. The leader of the Null Force's name was Emery Razorback.
Dungeon Master 01:41:16 And he was very much described as having higher intelligence, some cunning. He infiltrated initially pretending like he wanted to learn about the Great Fire Spirit before he sort of aimed all the followers that he sort of amassed into like a frenzied cult that was bent on killing and getting lavish gifts from the less fortunate. As he sets himself, everybody go ahead and roll initiative.
Cyrus Schwert 01:41:17 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 01:41:47 And then we'll take our break. Yeah. In general, yes. But as with all of the sort of woodland folk, they all sort of show a sense of intelligence. Like, this is just, you know...
Leopold Magnus 01:41:50 Hey, Jonathan. Would it, just for the lore, would it be unusual to find a gnoll that is this intelligent?
Kaladen Shash 01:42:10 thank you
Dungeon Master 01:42:16 parallel evolution of beings with time. If that makes sense. He seems more cunning. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know.
Leopold Magnus 01:42:21 Got it. So I guess he... Right. He's smartest of all the gnolls type of deal. Got it.
Dungeon Master 01:42:35 I like to think of it in my head as if sexual dichotomy in fish, which sounds weird to say, but the biggest fish will sometimes just get attributes that only it gets just because it's sort of the alpha. You get a sense that he is as big, muscular, smart as he is, and he's probably got some sort of power you don't know about, but because he is the leader of the gnolls.
Dungeon Master 01:43:03 And that if he were to be killed in battle, whoever was second runner-up would start developing these more advanced traits kind of deal. You see his ears twitch a little bit. Okay. Figure out what you do. I'll be right back.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:13 We definitely need to get his ears. Retire off those ears.
Kaladen Shash 01:43:16 That's fun. Did anybody pick up anything exciting or on their new level ups? 9, level 9, did anybody get anything good?
Cyrus Schwert 01:43:16 Oh, fuck. We're gonna be rich. Hmm?
Cletus Cobbington 01:43:20 I have multi-classed.
Kaladen Shash 01:43:50 Excellent. Druid and? I like that you're leaning into that. Hey, I was going to see. I was going to try to cast a Ring of Holding, where I try to see if I could start enchanting one of those. That way, potentially, there's wizard spells that you wouldn't have access to that you could hang on to. Or you could just load shield into it, because you have no armor class.
Cletus Cobbington 01:43:53 Took a level of cleric. Sure. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:43:57 Ooh, Claire.
Kaladen Shash 01:44:21 I'm just hoping to make something with, like, food. Yeah. So maybe I can convince him I can do, like, a simpler ring of holding if the only thing I want it to hold is a shield. I can get, like, two or three charges out of it.
Cletus Cobbington 01:44:21 That's where the daily boost of shield is nice, for sure. Yeah. Yeah, that'd be cool. I mean, the goal at some point is to find some heavy armor. That's one of the reasons I took the cleric, just so I could...
Cletus Cobbington 01:44:46 um i forget what like trait it is but you either take like a spell or proficiency in martial attacks and heavy armor i'm like something that can get my ac not fucking terrible but it also comes with more spells and some range spell attacks that aren't concentration which i was like
Kaladen Shash 01:44:58 yeah boom yeah yeah exactly you're stuck holding those things you all know that that moonbeam has been quite effective
Leopold Magnus 01:45:04 you
Cletus Cobbington 01:45:10 I just needed something else because all of my spells pretty much that are actually useful are concentration. So I can just never, I feel like I can never do more damage other than like, yeah. Like I like, yeah, I want to be able to do something alongside moonbeam after I cast it or after I like ritual, or not ritual, but conjure something, which little guiding bolt.
Kaladen Shash 01:45:32 Right. Yeah. Alright.
Cletus Cobbington 01:45:39 helps just as something. And especially with the range, since I want to kind of stay back still while I'm concentrating on spells. So hopefully it works out. There you go.
Kaladen Shash 01:45:57 Yeah, I'm going to just take one more level of wizard so I can unlock the level three spell book stuff. Get some good AoE effect and solve all the fighter mentality. So right now, technically, it's five fighter and four wizard.
Cletus Cobbington 01:46:11 Yeah. So what was your main class? Mm-hmm. Gotcha. OK.
Leopold Magnus 01:46:14 Bye-bye.
Kaladen Shash 01:46:25 For a very short period, it's going to be five and five, but then everything's going to be fighter after that, so it'll be a 15 fighter. I'll still get up to three attacks, because I think fourth attack's on 19th or 20th level. Given a little way, but not a whole lot for what I'm picking up. As a fighter, I can still cast shield. Almost that wheel. I've got misty step. I've got a whole bunch of extra stuff that the Eldritch Knight just wouldn't have yet.
Cletus Cobbington 01:46:47 Yeah, I thought of taking something like Fighter or something just to give me more attacks or more actions. But then I figured if I just have a little more Helpful Spells and AC, that would balance out what
Kaladen Shash 01:47:12 Yeah. You can really... You can lean... That's all right. I just took Warcaster. That way I can try to hold... Because I've got, like, Bless. It's really fun to hold Bless. I did it a few times against Jesse. Got it held for, like, four or five.
Cletus Cobbington 01:47:16 Yeah, actually get something to do. Not in the same turn I Conjure concentrate on something, but the whole Durian, so I don't have to just wait till I break concentration. Which does not help. Mm-hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:47:42 six, seven, eight rounds of battle. I think that's going to be fun, man. I don't know the martial class very well. I'm always playing the casters. When do you get to smite? When is that a thing? Yeah. Dang, really? Really?
Cyrus Schwert 01:47:51 I multi-classed as Paladin. Yeah. I'll be level 2. You only need 2 levels, Paladin. So, I'll be able to, and that's a free action to do, I guess. And then, so I can flourish for College of Swords barred.
Leopold Magnus 01:47:55 Interesting.
Cyrus Schwert 01:48:20 With a bonus action and add a d8. And then I can smite as well on the same turn. So if I crit, I can do all of it. Basically. And so it ends up being... Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And then...
Kaladen Shash 01:48:26 yeah that's what Jonathan would do I'd be like this is wild when he was rolling that little yeah it's like a triple class but he would add yeah he so much smites
Dungeon Master 01:48:27 28.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:45 Crazy.
Cyrus Schwert 01:48:47 Yeah. And then maybe I'll multi with fighter too. Like that'd be sick.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:52 Yeah, he basically took down that one legendary boss alone.
Kaladen Shash 01:48:58 Dude, he dealt out like 300 in that battle or something like that. It's wild.
Dungeon Master 01:48:58 Yeah. 300 a couple times. It was the climax of my character that I was spending everything I had. Min Mac.
Cyrus Schwert 01:49:17 I'm not usually like a one to... What's it called when you just make the best broken build possible? I'm blanking on the word. Yeah, I'm not the most min-max character creator, usually. But it's fun to do damage. And I like martial stuff more than spellcasting, so I'm leaning away from the spellcasting part a little. And need more support.
Kaladen Shash 01:49:34 That's okay. It's good that we got two people swinging swords out front. And even Leopold Sabran, like we've got
Dungeon Master 01:49:44 yeah my yeah the label's really active in the fight he made a cool weapon
Cyrus Schwert 01:49:48 um, kind of stuff like that. Yeah, exactly. The steel defender too, honestly, like,
Kaladen Shash 01:49:59 I didn't think he would be as active with an artificer, but now that he's got that saber, he's up there. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:50:06 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:50:08 Yeah. Well, I took, was it Battlesmith or whatever that subclass is? So they're kind of designed to be more frontline with the Steel Defender.
Dungeon Master 01:50:18 a couple things on that yeah it's fucking tough not even just sick there are the five the six and then the option of having 16 fucking animals on the field
Cyrus Schwert 01:50:21 We don't have to buff shit like crazy to fight us because there's basically six of us. At a certain point, we have to make them mobs and not individual animals. That's just so much stuff to roll.
Cletus Cobbington 01:50:39 yeah it's true it is nice if they were
Kaladen Shash 01:50:39 Who drew it? Pew, pew, pew. That's going to be so entertaining. I think that's what it's going to be. There's just going to be a pack mentality. One action. All happening.
Zariel Torgan 01:50:54 Grace, we're going to have to coordinate. We're going to have to both cast at the same time.
Cyrus Schwert 01:50:54 Yeah. That feels crazy. Right. Rolling 16 attack is, like, so...
Dungeon Master 01:50:55 I can only do that if the players agree. But if you guys are like, no, two wolves break out right and go investigate some shit, it's like, okay, sure. 16 velociraptors appear on the field.
Cletus Cobbington 01:51:09 Yeah. Exactly. That's funny. Going in, I knew you were a druid, but I didn't know enough about druids that a bunch of the conjure spells are just kind of normal druid spells. Since I'm Circle of the Shepherd, I thought it was very much so focused on that. So then when you cast it for the first time, I'm like, oh no, we really can just have way too many things going on.
Kaladen Shash 01:51:18 Do it. Do it.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:36 Oh. Yeah. Yeah, you can do it, dude.
Cletus Cobbington 01:51:39 I'm like, when you do it, I kind of like tell myself not to just for sake of like nap clutter. Well, I also, it's a balance of like, yeah. It's like, I like to kind of, yeah. Like opening up the fight by conjuring it. Like if we have a chance to prepare something.
Dungeon Master 01:51:40 Yeah. Nah, do it. That's cool because it'll force me to incorporate environment and AOE into the fight. Because I can do mass damage to the whole player. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:51:48 because I'm
Cyrus Schwert 01:51:48 It's a massive, massive deal.
Cletus Cobbington 01:52:05 And then once they're dead or that breaks, then I kind of just hard focus in the moonbeam to just shell out as much damage health as I can. That's kind of the easiest way to do it for me.
Dungeon Master 01:52:15 Yeah. And then another thing, I did have my earpiece in when I was out smoking, so I heard a little bit of it. I think it would be really cool if Kaladin offered to help guide Cletus in pushing the Esopteric
Dungeon Master 01:52:36 curse, taking intentional stress points in order to learn Esopteric Blast. So you have a good ranged spell that you use while you're concentrating. Because Esopteric Blast spell Kaladin created
Cletus Cobbington 01:52:49 Hmm. Yeah. Gotcha.
Dungeon Master 01:52:55 to sort of help cover his at-the-time deficit in battle. He had not as much action economy because he multi-classed so early. So Kaladin technically invented a spell that he could, in theory, teach you. The downside, though, is it required pushing himself curse-wise, and there are unforeseen consequences to that.
Kaladen Shash 01:53:08 Yeah, I guess you'll have to further explain some of those stress points. Have we talked about that very much with Cletus and Cyrus? Right? Has anyone? Yeah, no one's had a stress point since they've been in the party, right?
Cletus Cobbington 01:53:26 We have a little bit. I think we both had one the first session. I think, let me see. Yeah, I have one.
Dungeon Master 01:53:26 It hasn't come up. I'm still balancing the encounters. Yeah. But you guys would know that it takes... Yeah, you guys all got one initially, but it takes five for something to happen. So you guys are in a...
Cyrus Schwert 01:53:28 Is it from, like, the moon? What's up?
Kaladen Shash 01:53:39 Oh, there you go. Oh, there you go. So they did take something. Yeah, I talked about starting a new ring.
Leopold Magnus 01:53:45 Yeah, I'd have to double check, but I'm pretty sure you did early.
Dungeon Master 01:53:56 huge um delay mm-hmm
Cletus Cobbington 01:53:59 Give me actually something to
Kaladen Shash 01:54:06 Because we were talking about the ring and then I'll continue to teach him how to use the curse to channel that into the force energy and do an esoteric blast. We'll work on that for some hours and hours or whatever you deem it is. Are we just calling that
Cletus Cobbington 01:54:28 do during the camp.
Dungeon Master 01:54:31 Mm-hmm. Get yourself a hobby. A subject class. Oh, yeah, yeah. Can't trip to one. Yeah. You all have access to it, you know. Mm-hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:54:34 Are we calling that equivalent to a first-level spell? It's a cantrip? Yeah. Okay. So I don't know what that is in the book, as far as...
Leopold Magnus 01:54:51 Jonathan, you said something interesting was stress points happens at five. Damn, I'm at four. And I guess, Jesse, you have way more because you turned into Ultron. Is that what happened?
Dungeon Master 01:55:08 Well, that was just because he was always a Warforged. Zariel took his mutation, the manifestation of the curse, made it so that... Because most of the time when he went down, he was trying to get back up to help the party. So it was very non-selfish giving actions to keep himself moving. So his manifestation is that he can...
Zariel Torgan 01:55:09 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:55:11 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:55:33 if he needs to give health points out of his hit pool to heal somebody up to a certain amount so like he has to touch them and then he could transfer his life's essence into somebody else but i don't do i don't remember the other ones is anybody else over five yet
Leopold Magnus 01:55:50 I forgot about that. Yeah, because I'm definitely at four, so I just checked. Damn, dude.
Kaladen Shash 01:55:57 I think I want to say yes. Yeah, it says I've got six right now. I think maybe we didn't have a chance to if it had been
Cletus Cobbington 01:56:02 Yeah, 27.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:10 I'm at seven.
Dungeon Master 01:56:13 You almost got your second set. Did we talk about what happened to you or did we pass it? Maybe.
Cyrus Schwert 01:56:18 Yeah, not since we've been
Kaladen Shash 01:56:27 already out of the dome area it must have been because i don't i don't remember talking about any sort of yeah no i don't think we did but yeah i've got i've got i just have six that's okay yeah
Dungeon Master 01:56:44 We'll figure that out. Hold on. Because you would have taken a mutation. I will let you know what happens.
Kaladen Shash 01:56:56 Oh, I did. Didn't I? Oh, no, that's just when I put the mask on. That's what pushed me. That wasn't stress points. That's just the mask.
Cletus Cobbington 01:57:10 I mean, I'm getting mega willing not ones on survival jokes. No, I know. Yeah. Sure.
Dungeon Master 01:57:18 it'll come up when things get dire. So there's like chances to force 60. Uh, yeah, like it'll, it'll, it'll come up. But if clean is, if you ever fail something and you're tired of failing and you're like, I want to, I want to succeed. You can take a stress point and rule again. Like that's things, that's things you guys can do in the campaign, but makes you better than everybody else. Um,
Cyrus Schwert 01:57:40 Oh dear. Oh.
Leopold Magnus 01:57:47 One thing that we have seen regarding the ice object curse is if you use it for the wrong reasons, it can kind of corrupt you. So we did see a mage turn into a fire elemental when they pushed themselves too hard.
Cletus Cobbington 01:57:56 Right.
Dungeon Master 01:57:57 Yeah. OK. Oh shit, I cleared you guys' omission. Let me add you back. Is that where you are? Yeah, cool.
Zariel Torgan 01:58:01 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:58:33 Leopold, did you put your long rest in, or did you start off with damage? Yeah, longer set.
Dungeon Master 01:58:34 Okay. Up. Just go into it. Absolutely fucked.
Leopold Magnus 01:58:40 Oh, yeah, I was going to ask. Yeah, I didn't. I was sure we had, but I just wanted to double check. Yeah, good looking out. It's not full health at all. Half health.
Zariel Torgan 01:58:41 Oh yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:59:19 Leopold's up first. What would you like to do?
Leopold Magnus 01:59:28 Distance here, five feet. Yeah, so I'll cover half the distance to him. And split away from the group. That should be my full movement there. Check. And then once I kick off from the group,
Cyrus Schwert 01:59:41 you
Leopold Magnus 01:59:57 Actually, it would be a little shorter. I'll kick out Bone Crusher as my bonus action. Oh, sweet. Not very high. And also, it's in a weird spot in my spell sheet. I always have to find it. Sorry.
Dungeon Master 02:00:06 Cool. I finally got on it and I just created him a permanent token that I can grab. But I just need to know what is his HP? I think it's like 20 something. That's pretty good. And his AC is what?
Leopold Magnus 02:00:27 His total HP is 32 hit points. His AC is 15. Oh, fuck yeah. And his movement is actually further than mine.
Dungeon Master 02:00:43 There's Bell and Crusher for you. We'll say it's because he ejects out, yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:00:49 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:00:56 But I guess we'll get there. He can move 40 feet. Yeah. And so that was my bonus action. With my action, I'm just going to do a third level cannon. Just bend at the hip 90 degrees, whirl up and launch a catapult. Which is a deck save of 17. Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:01:19 Nice. And that is a deck save. He got a 19. You see you get down in your loaded gun position and eject it out of your mouth.
Leopold Magnus 02:01:26 I guess ignore that damage for now. Unless he passes. Ah, fuck me. Alright, so it misses.
Dungeon Master 02:01:45 and expecting it and taking that sick pleasure you see he like back flips as it passes him and lands and when he back flipped he left his sword so then he picks it back up um snarls uh thoroughly enjoying that after you unless you've got something else's bone crusher
Leopold Magnus 02:02:06 Yeah, so I'll make him go the additional... Yeah, he covered the additional distance. I'll make him play up and take an attack. He's going to do a Force Empowered Rend. 25 to hit.
Dungeon Master 02:02:27 Go for it. 25 hits. Good hit. Very nice.
Leopold Magnus 02:02:41 Nice. Eight damage from Bone Crusher on that slice. And that's my turn.
Cyrus Schwert 02:02:55 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:02:58 Okay, nice turn. After that, it is Cletus. These are satyrs, right? You have how many of them?
Cletus Cobbington 02:03:04 all right uh i'm gonna stomp my quarterstaff a couple times and say come back on here boys and summon my Rizzlers again
Zariel Torgan 02:03:17 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 02:03:30 So awesome.
Dungeon Master 02:03:36 Where do you want them? That's cool.
Cletus Cobbington 02:03:38 uh here i'll just move them kind of in like squadron formation i'll have one on the rock if that's cool i'll have two on the rocks two just chilling right here uh oh yeah initiative i don't think they add anything to it it's dex right for initiative
Dungeon Master 02:04:07 Yeah. That's fine. Thanks for telling me. 18. What's their dex bonus? You say plus three? Leopold, what's your dex bonus? Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:04:08 OK, plus 3, actually. OK, this is plus 3. I'm too lazy to add that in. 18. Plus 3. Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 02:04:31 For just my character? Plus two.
Dungeon Master 02:04:36 Trying to see who's faster. OK, so I'm going to put them just on 19 to keep them ahead of him on the combat tracker. OK, anything else? Who would you like to move?
Cletus Cobbington 02:04:46 I do my best work back here. Let's see. That's an action. I'll just show you my staff. Why not? That'll do me.
Dungeon Master 02:05:14 After that, you see Emery holds out his huge sword in one hand, perfectly level, and he just growls under his breath. Wildfire attack. And you see this creature lets out a loud screech as it descends, and it'll put itself with its movement. We'll play it by the rules.
Cletus Cobbington 02:05:42 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:05:47 80 feet, so it can definitely get there. It throws itself just right here for now. And it will take... It does two attacks, one with its bite and one with its stinger. So first attack on the satyr to our right, its left. That's a 9 to hit. I don't suppose...
Cletus Cobbington 02:06:14 Doesn't hit. Let's go, Riz. Doesn't hit.
Cyrus Schwert 02:06:15 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:06:18 The stinger goes on the other one. That's a natural 20. This just doesn't do it justice, but it'll be... Okay, you ready? Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:06:30 Morning. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:06:48 It dies. It has 31 HP. Unfortunate.
Dungeon Master 02:06:51 The satyr takes 32 points of damage. 10 of that is piercing. The rest of that is poison. I'm going to kill that one because he's the initiative guy. You see the stinger just like
Zariel Torgan 02:07:08 Doing fine.
Kaladen Shash 02:07:10 oh critical you
Cyrus Schwert 02:07:12 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:07:19 You don't see it because the tail ends in just kind of like a nub and then it goes to impact with the satyr's chest and you see the singer ejects out the back with black anchor dripping off and the satyr just sort of like fucking coughs on its own blood before falling off. He utters one last word. He just goes, Don't let the Riz die. Passes out. After that,
Cletus Cobbington 02:07:30 No. Oh, whoa.
Cyrus Schwert 02:07:45 Oh, that was so sick.
Dungeon Master 02:07:48 After that calendar zero go left.
Kaladen Shash 02:07:52 I think the first step I do is I'll cast mirror image on myself. And I'm going to go ahead and move 30 feet forward.
Kaladen Shash 02:08:20 And then bonus action Misty step. Right up to there. That's all I can do.
Cletus Cobbington 02:08:28 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:08:29 Okay. After that, it is Cyrus Schwartz.
Cyrus Schwert 02:08:48 Cyrus is gonna feel like I'm in I'm in range of the little wyvern thing. Cyrus is gonna come fucking try to fight a little wyvern by himself. Yeah. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:09:14 you
Dungeon Master 02:09:15 You got Rizzler number 19, I believe hit. Yes.
Cyrus Schwert 02:09:18 Yeah, that was fucking crazy. I'm going to take a couple swings at this wyvern while it's down close to the ground. 19 to hit for the first one. And a 20 must hit as well. A derby.
Kaladen Shash 02:09:21 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:09:46 33, good attack.
Cyrus Schwert 02:09:48 This is plus modifiers. So this is plus 16. So 33 damage on those two attacks.
Kaladen Shash 02:10:14 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:10:16 Already looking pretty fucked up. Not on Death's Door, but that hurts. After that, it is going to be Lead, Null, Razorback. Pretty pissed off already. Killing his dragon.
Cyrus Schwert 02:10:19 And that will do it for this round, I believe.
Dungeon Master 02:10:47 He will take three slashing attacks. No. He will take two slashing attacks.
Dungeon Master 02:11:05 and then one with his javelin. You see, it presents as just like a huge spin. He does a huge circle, trying to take out Kaladin and Bonecrusher, but then he throws down his sword real quick and pucks a javelin at Cyrus for hitting his steed.
Cyrus Schwert 02:11:12 Wow. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:11:30 That is not going to hit. Roll to see if it hits your mirror first. Yeah. I rolled a 12. Anyway, second attack will be against Bone Crusher while we figure that out.
Leopold Magnus 02:11:34 shot.
Kaladen Shash 02:11:40 Doesn't the mirror still have an AC, too, though? It's not just, does it hit the mirror? What was the roll? I think that's under. I got to read the spell real quick. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:11:42 you
Dungeon Master 02:12:03 He didn't roll very high. That was a two. That is 14 to hit Bonecrusher. Myth man. Just a poor fucking showing. And then the Javelin is a nat one. Jesus fucking Christ.
Leopold Magnus 02:12:10 14. Does not hit. Oh, no. Oh, geez. Oh, my God, dude. That's incredible.
Zariel Torgan 02:12:21 Yes.
Cyrus Schwert 02:12:22 That was fucking... I text you out of the air.
Cletus Cobbington 02:12:23 Damn. Flustered.
Kaladen Shash 02:12:26 Jonathan, they have an AC of 14. So that's a miss. My image is still up.
Dungeon Master 02:12:34 okay well then after that it is zario you see he does this really cool three-point landing jumps up into combat and then he spins and he kind of trips over himself a little bit and he snarls an embarrassment he like throws his spear which just goes wide hits the tree it sticks
Leopold Magnus 02:12:43 I just yell out, and you are the leader of the nose?
Zariel Torgan 02:13:02 All right. All right. I'm going to cast Fire Shield on myself and a...
Cletus Cobbington 02:13:02 All the satyrs laugh, point and laugh at him.
Cyrus Schwert 02:13:03 Yes.
Dungeon Master 02:13:08 What? I can do better, I promise. Hey, how about you go fuck yourself?
Kaladen Shash 02:13:10 Uh huh.
Leopold Magnus 02:13:14 I'm surprised they would follow such a buffoon.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:30 flaming shield will envelop my other shield floating in front of me and then I'm going to wild shape into a bear and run my bear distance. We're pretty far, aren't we? Yeah, I believe it stays up because it just says whoever cast it. I do believe, let me double check.
Cletus Cobbington 02:13:34 you
Kaladen Shash 02:13:43 with Flame Shield. It's exciting. No, it's cool. It's like the imagery of it. That's what I was asking. Yeah. Yeah, it's just on.
Zariel Torgan 02:14:02 Oh, gotcha. Yeah, because it's not concentration or anything, so... See if I can get there. Alright, so let's see how far I can get. Get right about... There. Oops. Get right about... There. That's action and bonus.
Dungeon Master 02:14:30 Okay. At the start of the round, it'll be the Satyrs.
Cletus Cobbington 02:14:33 Oh, shit. I may have accidentally glossed over the fact that the satyrs have more than 31 HP. That's OK. I have mighty summoner, so any beast or fey I conjure appears with more HP than normal, two extra HP per hit die.
Kaladen Shash 02:14:41 Oh.
Cletus Cobbington 02:15:02 So they have 78. So does that mean they have 14 extra HP? OK. So the other one's alive. So they have 31 HP. 14.
Dungeon Master 02:15:07 Yeah. So they took 32 points of damage and technically Cyrus couldn't stand there.
Kaladen Shash 02:15:14 There's seven die, yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:15:32 So they have 45 HP. My bad. I'm looking through all my stuff. I'm like, oh, wait. That is a thing. That's actually kind of helpful. OK. Rizzler has resurrected. I'm just going to have them all point and shoot at this dragon.
Dungeon Master 02:15:39 Okay, okay. Nice. Good catch. He kept up.
Kaladen Shash 02:15:48 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:16:02 All these have plus 5. 22 and 23. They're too far down. Yeah, they're shooting their short bows.
Zariel Torgan 02:16:08 While I'm thinking about it, I want to just mention that I want to use my enhanced fire aura so my bear paws have flames coming out.
Dungeon Master 02:16:17 Okay. And then a trace. These are all arrows, right? That's what they're doing? The two of them would have disadvantage, the ones right up next to them, but the other two would have straight. Okay. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 02:16:34 OK, so let's say those are the first two that they would miss. OK, so slash r 2d. The other one's 217. So plus 5, 22 and 22. OK, so that would be ..
Dungeon Master 02:16:53 Oh, nice. Both hit. Really intense. I don't think it needs to be up there.
Cletus Cobbington 02:17:05 16 damage from the other Rizzlers. And I'll have...
Dungeon Master 02:17:23 Nicely done. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 02:17:31 these two, one come back with me and this one spread out. I just actually have all of these ones just do a little bit of something too.
Dungeon Master 02:17:54 Good use. They're pretty effective. After that Leopold, you see the Rizzlers go to work on this Wyvern. You have your turn. Yeah, he looked embarrassing.
Cletus Cobbington 02:18:04 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 02:18:12 Okay, so he clearly just flopped there in his little attempt to make any kind of use of damage. And I think I've got an edge on him. I'm going to try and do a little performance. I'm going to try to insult him and take him down, roast him really hard.
Cyrus Schwert 02:18:35 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:18:38 I just want to give it to you, but I'm not just because that's an ability that bards get. And so you're just dipping into other classes by doing something like that.
Leopold Magnus 02:18:38 Is there something that I could maybe impose a very slight disadvantage because it's like I'm in his head and he's thinking about it and he's not fighting at the top of his game? Oh, okay. I didn't know bards have that. Then in that case...
Dungeon Master 02:19:05 You can do them for free, but it won't do anything to him mechanically.
Leopold Magnus 02:19:10 Okay. Well, I will diss him. Yeah, I'm going to talk hella shit. I'm going to be like, you call that your best? I've seen javelin throwers kill somebody on accident. And then I will do hideous laughter. Which I guess is a touch. Is it a touch spell?
Cyrus Schwert 02:19:11 You should still talk shit for sure.
Dungeon Master 02:19:34 Nice. What level spell is that?
Leopold Magnus 02:19:41 No, no, 30 feet. So I will cast Hideous Laughter on him. And I'll get up here behind, just kind of step over in front of Zariel. I don't know if it can be upcast, so level one.
Cyrus Schwert 02:20:00 Mm hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 02:20:04 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:20:09 This creature has what is called limited magic immunity. Emery Razorback can't be affected or detected by spells of first level or lower unless it wishes to be. It has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects. I didn't use that, and I shouldn't have, but he does not wish to be affected by this. You see he snarls, shifting focus to you. I said it wasn't going to mechanically matter, but I'm going to say he...
Leopold Magnus 02:20:14 Okay. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:20:21 Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:20:38 You outwardly insulted him and then tried to cast a spell on him. He's going to sort of focus in on you next. Go for it. Go for it.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:47 Okay, and then as my bonus action, I'll cast Magic Stone. Just call him up, and then I'll make Bone Crusher just do a Force-Empowered Rend. Ooh, 23 to hit. Cool.
Dungeon Master 02:21:13 23 hits. Nice. Very nice. After that is Cletus.
Leopold Magnus 02:21:17 Oh, nice. 11 damage on Bone Crusher. Hacking away at Emory. That's my turn.
Cletus Cobbington 02:21:32 all right let's see pretty close okay hmm so he has advantage or the dragon i mean has advantage on magic or magic attacks oh that was the null gotcha gotcha gotcha
Dungeon Master 02:21:51 The null has advantage against magic effects. Yeah. Go for it. That is...
Cletus Cobbington 02:22:03 You know what? Fuck it. I'm going to cast Blight on this Wyvern. I hate these scaly fuckers. That would be a constitution saving throw that it rolls. It's a 16. We take those. All right. 8 to 8.
Kaladen Shash 02:22:20 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:22:20 A natural four plus three, that's only a seven. Goddamn. Looking hurt. Doesn't change it, but good to know.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:26 Nice.
Cletus Cobbington 02:22:32 36 damage. And that's necrotic damage if that does anything. Cool. I think that's it. I think I'll stay over there. I don't think I have any bonus actions I want to do. Cool.
Dungeon Master 02:23:02 Okay. After that, you see this Wyvern takes this huge hit. This sort of gross, gross, like slimy creature, long serpent neck with like a muzzled face of just teeth screeches out in pain. I don't think it's very smart though. It's going to just do, it's to attack on the only one right in reach of it. It's going to attack Cyrus.
Cletus Cobbington 02:23:11 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:23:35 Jesus Christ. 15 to hit on the bite. Misses. Okay. Natural 2 for a plus 7. That's a 9. They're both bitches. I don't know who that is.
Cyrus Schwert 02:23:41 Yep. Oh, no. Excuse me. This dragon's a bitch. I'm fucking dodging out of the way. I'm dip-dodging and diving these shots.
Cletus Cobbington 02:23:49 you
Dungeon Master 02:24:05 It bites out, misses you, swings around, tries to hit you with its tail, and you just head tilt, lift your leg, and it misses on both as Kaladin simultaneously moves in on Razor. I'm going to start calling on Razor. I think it's easier.
Cyrus Schwert 02:24:17 Good.
Kaladen Shash 02:24:26 Yeah, already being inside of melee weapon attack range, I'm just going to go ahead and use a light splitter twice. And that's with advantage, right? He's considered an ally, correct? Correct. Comes first attack. Looks like a third you might hit. Just barely.
Dungeon Master 02:24:41 That's correct. 30? Yeah, it's... 1911. A few weapons.
Cletus Cobbington 02:24:54 What the fuck?
Kaladen Shash 02:24:57 There's a 19. There's a 19 plus a modifier. Very exciting. Second one. All right. 16. Did you say misses? Okay. Here's damage for the first hit.
Dungeon Master 02:25:15 16 misses.
Kaladen Shash 02:25:29 Oh, that's great. Don't go on. I just yell them. Yes. What beautiful ears you have my friends. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:25:36 Fuck up that scaly rat.
Dungeon Master 02:25:45 He gets really self-conscious. Cyrus, your go. Cyrus shits bricks.
Cletus Cobbington 02:26:07 That works.
Kaladen Shash 02:26:11 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:26:17 Well, because it's a different set of people, I'm just going to do Razor's turn in the meantime. With the hits on him, Callum, you see you slice into him twice and he goes down to a knee and he goes, ah! Brother, turn on these foes.
Dungeon Master 02:26:47 Embrace the frenzy. And he puts a hand on you as he casts dominate person. Paladin, give me a wisdom saving throw.
Cyrus Schwert 02:26:56 You're about to be wild about it.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:57 You have advantage against being charmed. Yeah, this should count.
Kaladen Shash 02:27:01 Yeah, I'm not wild about this. Here I come. Charmed, but not charmed. Charmed is a spell by itself. This is like domination. Yeah, so there we go. It's just your advantage.
Dungeon Master 02:27:19 This is a charmed effect, if it extends to that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That is a success.
Leopold Magnus 02:27:25 Oh.
Kaladen Shash 02:27:31 Got this. Okay. 19? I'm just staring him in the eyes.
Cletus Cobbington 02:27:36 Come on.
Zariel Torgan 02:27:37 Nice Nice
Dungeon Master 02:27:49 You see, the moment he realizes this didn't take effect, his, like, fake smile with his gnarled teeth turns to a snarl, and he was already ready to sort of saw your gut with his sword. He'll take his attack. He just gets the one now. Jesus Christ. Thirteen. Which misses even a mirror image. I can't roll above a five.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:13 And he's beefing it hard.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:17 This is even my image.
Leopold Magnus 02:28:21 I'm in your head, Razorback!
Dungeon Master 02:28:26 Shut up! Travis, if you're here, it's still your turn, technically. Yeah. On the wyvern, does hit.
Cyrus Schwert 02:28:26 Yeah, sorry. Okay. Here we go. I'm going to... Witherin's still in my business, right? He attacked me again. Okay. Then I'll take a couple more. 16 to hit. Oh. And an 18.
Cletus Cobbington 02:28:27 Let's go.
Dungeon Master 02:28:56 both hit. Mm-hmm. Do you still have an Almond that Cletus can activate if he wants to, or do you want to stay at it?
Cyrus Schwert 02:28:58 And I'm going to do a splashing flourish. Or I'll do a defensive flourish instead. So let's do that.
Cyrus Schwert 02:29:25 I mean, if he wants to send it, I'll send it. Is it Cletus' decision to do that, or is it... Okay. Okay. Oh, he's gonna die.
Cletus Cobbington 02:29:32 Fuck it. Yeah. Kill this scaly fucker. Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:29:34 It is Cletus' decision. A hit to a crit. So it'll be his normal damage doubled, his defensive damage doubled, his modifier doubled.
Kaladen Shash 02:29:34 It's a hit to a crit. Is that what it is? Wait.
Cyrus Schwert 02:29:57 Yes. Okay, this is plus 32. So... 66. I do the same thing that I did to the bird a while ago where I fucking try to put its hands behind its back like it's an episode of Cops and I'm arresting him. But he has wings, so they just snap.
Dungeon Master 02:30:04 Jesus. 34 damage. Cyrus, finish this wyvern.
Cletus Cobbington 02:30:04 The almond digests in your stomach. And it's pretty big.
Zariel Torgan 02:30:23 Sleep.
Leopold Magnus 02:30:24 you just hear the cops b-roll bad boys bad boys what you gonna do playing in the background
Dungeon Master 02:30:28 They're normally so flexible with, like, the way they're supposed to bend. You just... It snaps off backwards. It lets out a loud screech. It, like, sort of wriggles in your grip as it starts to just pass as you snap its spine. It lays flat, sort of flops off the rock. So finished. What you gonna do? Uh...
Cyrus Schwert 02:30:32 Exactly.
Cletus Cobbington 02:30:47 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:30:53 I don't
Leopold Magnus 02:30:55 Yeah, like, there's a cameraman, and they're like, filmed on-site with adventurers. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:31:00 Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
Cyrus Schwert 02:31:01 It's like a really shaky camera. And then I guess with my movement, I'll come closer to these homies. And that will do my turn. And then the first D8 is what I'm going to use for the defensive 4-ish. So my AC goes up by 5 for this turn as well. And that is it.
Dungeon Master 02:31:23 nice that technically happened before he went so he sees his pet get slain in front of him and he makes his attack with tears in his eyes
Cletus Cobbington 02:31:34 Let's go. When you have a tough day, it happens.
Cyrus Schwert 02:31:34 Let's go. The juicy almond was worth it. You're going to fucking die, hyena man.
Dungeon Master 02:31:53 This bizarre guy is so emotional. He sees that he's going to die. He doesn't have anything to disconnect or anything. He is going to just run. He's going to try to flee. He will reaction shield, so he's got a much higher AC.
Kaladen Shash 02:31:56 That makes sense. That makes sense. Why do you miss? No.
Zariel Torgan 02:31:59 Yes.
Cletus Cobbington 02:32:16 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:32:17 No.
Kaladen Shash 02:32:27 That's right. Take an attack. 30, 20. Good.
Dungeon Master 02:32:42 30-20 misses. Bone Crusher can take a soul-empowered rend or whatever it is.
Leopold Magnus 02:32:58 Oh, because he's moving. Yep, got it. Plus nine. Oh, 27, baby. Another 10 damage. Bone Crusher is fucking slicing this guy up.
Dungeon Master 02:33:15 27 hits. Nice. After that, Zarya, we see this guy starts to sprint into the forest.
Cletus Cobbington 02:33:27 Oh yeah, you're a bear.
Leopold Magnus 02:33:38 He's just fucking off.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:39 I don't think I can even reach him if I run that far. I guess I'll go and I'll use my action to run. I just want to get on the other side of him and stop so that hopefully on his turn I can use a reaction to do something. Yeah, I look very scary.
Cletus Cobbington 02:34:00 Fire claws. Hell yeah. They're all fucking shooting bows. They're pointing them down.
Dungeon Master 02:34:10 We have a fire shield as well, too. At the top of the round, it's a satyr's go. Go ahead and make those four attacks.
Zariel Torgan 02:34:13 Fire Shield and Fire Claws.
Kaladen Shash 02:34:25 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:34:30 All these have plus 5. OK. 23, 22, and dirty 20. Damn. OK. Fair enough.
Dungeon Master 02:34:47 All of those miss. His AC is 24 with shield. 19 plus 5. They give a slight nod. Leopold, you're going to do something.
Cletus Cobbington 02:35:00 They stop pointing. They respect him a little bit more now.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:05 Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 02:35:13 You're not getting away that fast, Razorback. At that speed, you're going to trip and fall. And I'll move in another 30 feet. I wish I had that measurement on. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:35:33 I also have had the satyrs move up.
Dungeon Master 02:35:34 It's in your sevens. Which are the top of the trees?
Leopold Magnus 02:35:37 So I'll move up. Is this clearing fairly wide, or is it just these tops of the trees? OK, all right. Yeah, so then I'll leave room for the rest of the team. And let's see.
Leopold Magnus 02:36:09 I'll cast Ice Knife, but I'll do a third level Ice Knife. 21 to hit. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:36:17 21 misses, but it misses him and explodes. Jesse, give me a Darity saving throw in bear form.
Zariel Torgan 02:36:34 8. Now.
Dungeon Master 02:36:49 Leopold, go ahead and roll the second half of the damage to Zariel.
Kaladen Shash 02:36:49 No.
Leopold Magnus 02:36:57 Dexterity save 2d6. That's pretty low. Very low. Oh, I'll use my bonus action to throw a throw a rock.
Cletus Cobbington 02:37:02 Got fire claws. He melts the ice.
Dungeon Master 02:37:09 Bear Zariel just kind of blows up in your face as the ice explodes. Sort of. He skids back onto his heels as it explodes in front of him. After that, it's bone pressures go. Go for it. You take one point.
Zariel Torgan 02:37:27 Oh, I have resistance to that because the fire shield melts the ice, so I only take one.
Leopold Magnus 02:37:28 one damage that's hilarious uh the stone goes ah come on 14 misses uh but yeah bone crusher is up next he's the one that's really in the fight um
Kaladen Shash 02:37:34 Hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 02:37:34 you
Dungeon Master 02:37:42 Yes, it does. He's got 40 feet of movement. He can get there.
Leopold Magnus 02:37:57 Yeah, okay. Yeah, I will. I'll close the distance and I'll block off his other path of attack. Or retreat. Try to narrow his options. And I'll have him do a Force Empowered Rend. Come on. That fucking Bone Crusher's got it. Oh, but
Dungeon Master 02:38:22 Jesus, 28 hits. Goddamn. Okay. Good hit. This guy just looks like such a fucking tool. He's such a shrimp.
Cletus Cobbington 02:38:22 All right. I'll start moving up and on. Point my...
Kaladen Shash 02:38:22 God is number one.
Zariel Torgan 02:38:23 I was going to say, your pet is fucking him up.
Leopold Magnus 02:38:27 Low damage roll, but yeah, five. Five damage. It's getting killed by my defending suit of armor.
Cyrus Schwert 02:38:31 You should.
Dungeon Master 02:38:51 Jumped in. Missed almost every single attack and then had to flee. Nice. 29. God damn it. She's 21 damage.
Cletus Cobbington 02:38:52 Tragic. I'll point. There you go. Point my staff at him, and I'll cast Guide and Bolt at him. 29 to hit. It's just radiant damage if it means anything. Ooh, 21 damage. That was good.
Zariel Torgan 02:38:58 I'm gonna have my dogs finish him. Oh, nice.
Leopold Magnus 02:39:00 Give him a taste of blood.
Kaladen Shash 02:39:12 This guy's not getting away. Look at those dice, man. That's hot. Hot.
Cyrus Schwert 02:39:16 Wow. Nice. That's a really good rule.
Cletus Cobbington 02:39:26 uh yeah i'll do it that'll do me oh it channels straight through the staff uh my little my nature energy entwines through all the almonds i've uh bejeweled my staff with and then just power clusters at the end and shoots out at him
Dungeon Master 02:39:31 How does this new kind of power come out of Cletus?
Cletus Cobbington 02:39:57 Oh shit. Hell yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:39:57 huge explosion of greenish energy out of the front of your staff and it's got like a little breaks a little sound wave light in front of it like a little egg cloud that jets do when they move fast enough and just accelerates into his back dealing pretty significant damage I would be the wyvern but it's dead up next is Kaladin
Kaladen Shash 02:40:21 I'm going to begin to run forward. But halfway there, I'm going to cast a Soptric Blast. Oh, that was almost 18. That misses. I'm going to close the distance.
Kaladen Shash 02:40:51 And do two attacks. Is it just next attack? Is that what Guiding Bolt is? Let's try again. Not quite. 18.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:54 I think that's got advantage, doesn't it? Because of the guiding bolt. Mm hmm. Try them.
Dungeon Master 02:41:00 It would. 18 still missed this, unfortunately. Good remembering. But that means it's guiding both still up because nothing hit.
Kaladen Shash 02:41:29 Okay. Does that mean I would get... This thing is just... Right, yeah. Okay. Close the distance, but now I have advantage again, right? Because he's... I've got giant bear form. Sorry, L. Perfect. All right. First light splitter attack. 15 misses. Golly. It's all right. Sneak one in there.
Dungeon Master 02:41:31 Oh, well, no, I think it's just next. Sorry. Blank, yeah. Misses.
Leopold Magnus 02:41:52 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:53 Yes. Yes.
Kaladen Shash 02:42:01 nope 17. i'm going to use i know i used all 30 feet just getting there i can't i can't scoot any further
Dungeon Master 02:42:04 Welcome to the club, Ren. It's nice to have you. Let me tell you. Cyrus, here we go. Yeah. Cyrus sees this guy jump out of the trees, miss every single attack. His pet dies. He goes to flee. He gets surrounded.
Cyrus Schwert 02:42:08 First,
Cletus Cobbington 02:42:34 Oh yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:42:37 Cyrus is going to kind of reposition a little bit. Do his movement. And I'm going to cast Wind Wall on him. Cling my sword super hard.
Dungeon Master 02:42:59 Okay. What does he do? Okay, okay. 24. 24.
Cyrus Schwert 02:43:05 he does a strength saving cow how do you turn these things rotate it okay so he'll take half of I think it probably will hit the bear as well
Kaladen Shash 02:43:20 Let's say it's really soft. Let's do that.
Cyrus Schwert 02:43:38 Jeez, what horrible rules. He takes half of seven. But that's not right. Do I guess it vertically or horizontally? I guess I don't know.
Cletus Cobbington 02:43:39 That bear has a name.
Dungeon Master 02:43:39 You can avoid the bear by doing that. Who knows?
Leopold Magnus 02:44:06 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:44:08 He takes half of seven because I rolled like hell. He takes three. Let's go. I did a slight breeze and his dipper flipped up and hit him in the eye. That's all.
Dungeon Master 02:44:09 Just barely flips him, though. Takes three points of damage. I added that. I feel so panicked. Up next is his turn. He loses his AC boost, but he's got nowhere to go.
Zariel Torgan 02:44:19 Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 02:44:27 Yes.
Dungeon Master 02:44:36 he goes fuck you I'll take one of you with me I fucking swear and he starts swinging down on I think in his eyes Kaladin would look the squishiest between a suit of armor and a giant bear so he'll take his attacks on you no advantage nothing cool first one is 26 to hit so roll for the mirror image yeah
Cletus Cobbington 02:44:52 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:45:02 Jonathan, I'll have my bone crusher deflect that attack. The defender imposes disadvantage on the attack roll. One creature can see within five feet. Provide the attack rolls against a creature other than the defender. Yeah, it's a reaction.
Dungeon Master 02:45:11 Read that one for me. It was actually a 16 to hit, which still hits the mirror image, right? OK. So it still takes out one of those. And that's disadvantage for just one attack.
Cyrus Schwert 02:45:12 Give us reaction.
Kaladen Shash 02:45:23 That would hit the mirror image, yes.
Cletus Cobbington 02:45:32 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:45:34 Yeah. Imposes disadvantage on the attack roll. Yeah, so I think it's just one.
Dungeon Master 02:45:41 One attack, Rex? Okay. Okay, so his other two attacks are just still straight then. Doesn't lose that. Dirty 22 to hit. Does that hit another mirror? Shield. Shield.
Kaladen Shash 02:45:59 Shield. Oh, that's right. Two more mirrors. I got to remember that. Two, it hits me. Do I lose the image or does it hit me? Oh, yeah, I'll shield. Oh, it's a four. So, yeah, they both just missed my AC as well.
Dungeon Master 02:46:11 Oh, so the first one didn't lose the mirror. You still had it. Okay, so you shield, so it's two misses. Yeah, because it misses the mirror, but it wouldn't hit you because you can shield. So you would have shielded on the first one or the second one because it
Kaladen Shash 02:46:29 How does that work? Just two misses. Right. On the second one, 22. Yep. All right. And...
Dungeon Master 02:46:42 Missed your AC. Last attack is pretty good. 27 to hit. Dude, nice. Okay, well, I got one hit. I'm just celebrating the little wins here.
Kaladen Shash 02:46:57 I like that mirror image crap that hits me. Couldn't roll above a six. All right. Registered. That's
Cletus Cobbington 02:47:00 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:47:10 You take 24 points of slashing damage. Um... Fuck it. He's gonna front route all three of you in a straight line now. Yeah. Oh, he used his reaction already. Two attacks of opportunity.
Leopold Magnus 02:47:12 got one strike in not bone crusher he used a reaction
Kaladen Shash 02:47:27 We all get an attack then, yeah?
Zariel Torgan 02:47:39 Can I use my attack to be a grappling attack? Or is that not something I can do? OK. Gotcha. 23? All right.
Cyrus Schwert 02:47:41 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:47:46 Not for attack to opportunity. Because then you're basically just ripping off Sentinel, which is a feat. Both hit. He had a lot of HP, but Jesus Christ. 30, okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:47:54 damn this guy is getting fucked
Kaladen Shash 02:47:59 26. Why? Why are you running away? 30. Yes. 30 more.
Zariel Torgan 02:48:14 plus another d6 I feel like it's that African meme why are you running why are you running
Cyrus Schwert 02:48:16 Come back and fight all 12 of us like a man.
Cletus Cobbington 02:48:22 The Rizzlers have resumed pointing him down. Just FYI.
Dungeon Master 02:48:25 starting to look pretty hurt okay you got it they've lost respect after that it's Zariel's turn proper
Zariel Torgan 02:48:52 All right, I am going to run. I can get right here. Less than that. And then I'm going to make my attacks. All right, so this is the bite.
Dungeon Master 02:49:05 I should have given him more movement or something. I should have done something different. But he is. He was trying to run away and you guys are beating him to the ground. 12 damage plus fire damage. 21 points.
Kaladen Shash 02:49:08 get out it's all this is
Cletus Cobbington 02:49:13 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:49:15 beat down just he's on the ground we're all kicking him
Zariel Torgan 02:49:28 All right. And then another D6 on top of that. So that's going to be, you say 12 fire damage? I only rolled nine damage. The 12 total.
Dungeon Master 02:49:44 No, it was 12 on the claw damage, 9 on the fire, 3 extra. Oh, that was such a hit. Gotcha. Still very hurt, but not as close to death's door.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:54 I have two hits. One was a bite and one was a claw. The claw missed with a 12. And then on the bite damage I did 9. So I only did 12 total. I didn't do 24. They're going to kill him. They're going to get him.
Dungeon Master 02:50:15 Up at the top, it's the Rizzlers. They kill it. That's funny. Second one misses. Third one, what do they add? They add plus three to it.
Cletus Cobbington 02:50:19 The Rizzlers. Let's go. Oh, they are launching arrows. Plus five to these. Nat 20 on one. Nat 20 and a dirty 20. Five. It's a dirty 20.
Kaladen Shash 02:50:22 It was meant to be meant to be.
Zariel Torgan 02:50:35 Yes.
Dungeon Master 02:50:45 Or plus five. They have five. First and third one hit. So it'll be three damage die of whatever your damage is. And I tell you, you need 26 points of damage.
Cletus Cobbington 02:50:52 one okay yeah all right 23 so close
Kaladen Shash 02:51:13 Ooh, left it hanging. Low fruit, Leopold. Yep.
Cyrus Schwert 02:51:14 Oh.
Leopold Magnus 02:51:17 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:51:20 Okay, it's nine. What do you normally add to your damage dice? Is it plus three? You did it right. Okay, I was just making sure. Yeah. The Rizzler's like Achilles from Troy. Just arrow, arrow, arrow, arrow. He's like on his knees bleeding blood. He's like
Cletus Cobbington 02:51:26 Plus 3 if I did 3. So double damage on one. Hell yeah. It's just holding on for no reason.
Dungeon Master 02:51:50 I defeat I submit Leopold your turn
Leopold Magnus 02:52:03 Yeah, so I'll run up and just launch another searing insult instead of the searing saber. And I'll say, you're a sorry excuse for a no. What are you, cosplaying as a leader or something? And I'll kind of kick his knees from behind until he kneels. And I'll be like, Cyrus, get over here and cuff this moron.
Kaladen Shash 02:52:28 Well,
Leopold Magnus 02:52:31 And I guess I'll do some non-lethal damage. Assuming I have a connect on something. 20 to hit? What's that? Okay, nice. So then... That would be... plus another 1d6.
Cyrus Schwert 02:52:36 on me.
Dungeon Master 02:52:41 20 hits. 20 hits. Well, he only has three hit points. So you're not doing lethal damage, correct?
Leopold Magnus 02:53:03 15 damage? Okay. No, yeah, I'm doing non-lethal damage. I'm getting this guy arrested. We need to throw him in the back of the squad car. Alright.
Cyrus Schwert 02:53:19 Who's that?
Dungeon Master 02:53:19 Okay, he is knocked unconscious. Go ahead and roll me a d4. Oh, he's going to be unconscious for five hours. One d4 plus one hours.
Leopold Magnus 02:53:35 Holy shit. And I turned to the camera crew and I said, did you get that, boys? Yeah. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:53:51 One of the satyrs is holding the camera.
Zariel Torgan 02:53:52 Hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 02:53:52 i go over to him and i light him a cigarette like it's a dog the bounty hunter i know you just i know you just ruined your life but you want a cigarette is that every episode
Dungeon Master 02:53:58 He's unconscious. He's unconscious.
Leopold Magnus 02:54:18 You're going to do a lot of hard time for this. Yeah, well, we're weakening at Bernie's here. I threw a pair of A's down over his face so you can't tell he's unconscious.
Cyrus Schwert 02:54:29 And that was it. And you almost killed a fucking satyr.
Kaladen Shash 02:54:34 You crushed. You hit me one time. He did so good.
Dungeon Master 02:54:38 Well, that was an embarrassing encounter. I missed on my spells. I missed on my attacks. I almost killed one satyr on a below average. It was 96 poison damage. Or 76 plus the normal piercing.
Cletus Cobbington 02:54:41 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:54:52 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:54:55 I think bone crusher did over 30 damage which is pretty 35 40 damage yeah that's just totally free
Cletus Cobbington 02:55:12 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:55:17 It's great for free action economy.
Dungeon Master 02:55:18 you guys exit combat barely harmed at all you have about a half day travel that'll be the encounter check for the day so as you guys finish your travel this will be starting off with
Dungeon Master 02:55:47 the next two days and we'll just run through it. Unless you guys have specific things we want to do, go ahead and just roll me. And unless it's a horrible failure, you guys have exhausted the encounter list. So there's only like one bad thing. So just go ahead and give me two encounter checks.
Cletus Cobbington 02:56:09 I'm good.
Leopold Magnus 02:56:12 I can do one. Oh, fuck. It's pretty low. Oh, Jesus Christ, dude. We're slugging it. Slugging it out.
Kaladen Shash 02:56:17 Is that just a straight D20? How about the three? It's lower. I can't remember. One.
Zariel Torgan 02:56:20 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:56:21 Just a d20. That's not a horrible failure, though. Give me another one. Oh, no. That was a three. OK. OK.
Cyrus Schwert 02:56:24 Oh my god. I'll do one. Oh no. Let's see what I would have gotten. Yeah, that makes sense.
Cletus Cobbington 02:56:41 Oh.
Kaladen Shash 02:56:47 17. Yeah, can I begin to try to do a ring of holding, but the only thing it would hold would be shields?
Dungeon Master 02:56:50 um something will happen at the end of the next day but we'll narrate up until that point uh as you guys bed down for the first night is anybody doing anything are you spending time doing your enchanting stuff
Cyrus Schwert 02:57:04 it's not as good
Kaladen Shash 02:57:15 And we could try to figure out how many charges roll. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:57:19 Yeah, there's a whole thing for doing charge number. Okay, so we'll just start with shield as first level. Cool, yeah. So it'll cost you... An uncommon item. Yeah. In total, $2,000 worth of materials. It'll be...
Cyrus Schwert 02:57:44 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:57:46 32 hours, four checks. So four successes before four failures, each of them DC 14. You could stop. Yeah. If it's four checks, it's broken up into four increments.
Kaladen Shash 02:57:56 Great. I have 140 in cash right now, but I would just like to start the project. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, Jesse, I'm going to steal like 386 gold.
Cletus Cobbington 02:58:14 for four payments of $19.99. And craft the Fushigi. Fushigi!
Dungeon Master 02:58:16 You could put in the funds later. And you would have two days worth. So how many evening hours would you like to dedicate to it?
Zariel Torgan 02:58:28 Alright, I'll mark it off.
Kaladen Shash 02:58:28 Got 114. Yeah. That's 500. I think six hours each night would be pretty easy because the whole meditation, I don't have to worry about anything. I don't think we're getting to camp super late. Was that two checks here?
Dungeon Master 02:58:46 Yeah. So you have... Yeah, it'll be two checks and you're knocking out 12 hours. You'll have 20 left. Success. Success.
Kaladen Shash 02:59:01 All right, first check. 15. 17.
Dungeon Master 02:59:14 17 success. Okay. Two successes. Almost half the time out. Good progress in establishing the basics. You go to bed pretty exhausted each night having channeled so much arcane energy for six hours a night. Anybody else doing something to end their days each night? Go ahead and give me animal handling checks. You were working on a hide command, right?
Zariel Torgan 02:59:34 Um, I wouldn't mind training the pups a little bit. Yeah, I wanted to get that one down before I went to anything else. And then, do I still get the advantage because of the feeder, or was that a plus two, or what was I getting with that? Plus two, okay. So, I'll roll two checks. Or do you want two checks, or...
Dungeon Master 02:59:48 Cool. The plus two. Two checks, yeah. 14.
Zariel Torgan 03:00:05 Okay, so the first one's a 14. The second one is a 16. 18, sorry. 14 and an 18. Hmm.
Dungeon Master 03:00:13 18 succeeds, 14 doesn't. You've already done quite a bit to this. I'll say with that final success, you can get them to hide. And it's not like super specific at this point. It's like they'll go to an out-of-the-way place. But you feel if you put more time into it, you could be like point in height and get them to go to certain spots.
Dungeon Master 03:00:39 But they've got the basic command down. You could switch, and they would still have this one down. Anything else? You say Cyrus went to sleep?
Zariel Torgan 03:00:45 Sweet. Okay, cool.
Leopold Magnus 03:00:55 I, having packed this giant gnoll all the way to camp, I'm going to kind of like lean him up against a tree, splash a little water on his face. I tied him all up, you know, so he can't move or anything. And I kind of want to question him. Yeah. Can I question this gnoll?
Kaladen Shash 03:01:03 Yes, why do we see? Yeah, we do too.
Cletus Cobbington 03:01:13 Yeah, I forgot you took it. He has so many arrows in him.
Dungeon Master 03:01:23 Go ahead.
Leopold Magnus 03:01:25 Okay. Yeah. So I kind of like, you know, spruce him up a little bit so he's not on death's door. Oh, oh, Ibery, you know, based on your performance out on the field, I kind of kind of suspect you weren't really cut out for that life. What are you doing as the captain of the NOLS?
Dungeon Master 03:01:50 comes to real groggily, spits in your helm. Piss off. My love for blood gave me the top. Heard tell?
Leopold Magnus 03:01:58 Oh, an unkindly fellow. Maybe that's what rose you to the top of the ranks. All piddle and no spittle. How did you get acquainted with that giant fire spirit?
Dungeon Master 03:02:20 Roosting on the mountain, not hard to see. The old fart was dumb enough to let us in. Easy from there. His death.
Leopold Magnus 03:02:30 Oh, and what did you provide him in exchange? Oh, you're quite strange, I suppose. Makes sense you tracked down a lethal party of adventurers like us and tried to attack with no backup.
Dungeon Master 03:02:47 I'll say, how about you untie me and we fucking square this like, like the brave gnolls we are. Yeah. You look so tough, metal man.
Zariel Torgan 03:02:48 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 03:02:49 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 03:02:57 Oh, well, you want to fight again? After the first time, do you... Oh, you have quite the... You have quite the memory. I'll just kind of start undoing his ropes there, and I'm just going to cut him in half. This guy is wasting my time.
Cletus Cobbington 03:03:00 I summon four more sagers.
Kaladen Shash 03:03:22 Yes.
Dungeon Master 03:03:22 He's going to attempt to run away. Go ahead and give me an attack of opportunity. Seven hits. He effectively would have had one HP, so no amount of damage he can live.
Leopold Magnus 03:03:28 All right. Hell yeah. 27. Well, I suppose I'll be doing everyone a service. And I just and his head goes rolling.
Zariel Torgan 03:03:38 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 03:03:55 And you start to see this necrotic kind of wisp of magic essence just get pulled into the sword. And the blade just collapses. Other than that, I guess that probably would have taken most of the night.
Dungeon Master 03:03:57 Very nice. Okay. Narrating as we close up.
Dungeon Master 03:04:25 You guys finish out your second to last day. The tone of the forest shifts with time. You guys going down in elevation get brief glimpses of like the opaque blueness that is the top of the dome. It's so far away that you're like, you've got it in eyeline now. It's just a matter of getting there. As you travel the forest density, it goes up and down, but
Dungeon Master 03:04:55 you find that... Let's see if this is the one I want. Pretty sure. Yeah. You guys are moving through a dense fog, always permeates the area. You're starting to walk through and you notice...
Dungeon Master 03:05:19 That, like, you can tell the creatures are bigger and meaner the more you get to the center of the thing. You see huge spider webs sort of cascading through the trees, connecting them in intricate networks far above your head. Very similar to, like, the second Hobbit movie, you know, when they're going through the forest. Huge amount of webs and you stop hearing animals. There's no bird calls.
Dungeon Master 03:05:47 There's no various insect sounds. It just becomes very eerily silent, and there's like a weight almost just to the air. You, for a moment, think maybe we should go around this area, but in the two-day travel, you sort of branch out one way, go forward into the other, and it just seems to be pretty never-ending. You don't find that there's an easy way out.
Cletus Cobbington 03:06:11 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 03:06:15 You are finishing out the very last bit of this journey, which is going to take you through whatever the hell this is. But we'll pick that up next time. You were essentially to set the tone for next session. You'll make it to Moonhaven next session, but you just have to make it through this last little portion of jungle. The next one will be you guys arriving at the dome. But we're going to end our session right there.
Kaladen Shash 03:06:40 Sweet.
Cletus Cobbington 03:06:41 Cool.
Zariel Torgan 03:06:42 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 03:06:42 Cool. Hell yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:06:47 I cannot believe I think I hit twice in the whole encounter.

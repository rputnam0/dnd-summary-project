Dungeon Master 00:00:00 that the source, the center, Craig Fox, by the way, of the spider web area is somewhere under the Sylphane district. And you guys are just south of that in Calatheal, which is at the center. And again, you guys will find a map shortly, and you'll be able to see what it looked like before it was flooded to break it down.
Kaladen Shash 00:00:02 And.
Dungeon Master 00:00:26 but the pole is sort of 90 degrees to your right. It's like, you know from where you are. Again, also important note, Calafio is subterranean to the rest of the city. So this wall, so the city built on this tier system, where as you get to the back end, it's higher and higher, which is why part of the city is not underwater. Every time you get towards a different district, it's sort of on this huge face of stone.
Dungeon Master 00:00:53 Calatheal is built just into that stone, so you'd have to backtrack, go out, and just by the build of the city, you would have to head towards the spiders to start with, but you could break right and head towards the top if you would like to. That is an option. You can avoid the whole sequence if you want to. It's up to the party.
Leopold Magnus 00:01:14 Glathiel was the core analog to the new New Arbor. Hilarion, OK. I see.
Dungeon Master 00:01:27 No, that's an Alerian. This area would probably have been unimportant in general to your guys' mission. It was Kaladin telling you that he felt drawn there. So it was like a side quest checkbox kind of deal. It just puts you guys in a spot where I'm looking at the map. You are sort of in the center of the dome, but you have to pick a direction to kind of go at this point.
Kaladen Shash 00:01:27 That's a good question. Good question.
Cletus Cobbington 00:01:35 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:01:59 Well, I mean, is it quicker, we're thinking, to check out this creature thing with the spiders and then head up? Or do you guys want to nail down a way to get out with a teleportation circle? And then once we've got that done, go back? What do you guys think?
Dungeon Master 00:02:03 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:02:17 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:02:24 I'm flexible. The one point about the teleportation circle is we did get a little hint that we need to go back to Nunu Arbor the way we came. And I think it was interpreted we need to go in through the caves rather than use a teleportation circle.
Dungeon Master 00:02:38 But also important to note that that would be a tremendously long journey if you were to walk
Kaladen Shash 00:02:47 Yeah, I'm good exploring the creature situation as long as the side quest is satisfied before we seek out the teleportation circle. That's all.
Leopold Magnus 00:02:49 Yeah, yeah. So we might be able to find some kind of... Anyways, I'm with you on that one. Got to find a unique way to get back, but I'll just zap in right in front of everyone.
Cletus Cobbington 00:03:07 I look down and look at my hooves. Uh.
Dungeon Master 00:03:12 Mm hmm.
Zariel Torgan 00:03:14 Yeah. Yeah, let's do it. Sweet. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:03:16 That lines up pretty much with what we were thinking about route-wise anyway. What do your spider feet feel? Oh, is it?
Leopold Magnus 00:03:22 fry some Spidey. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:03:37 feels a little squishy not gonna lie i don't think i'm in spider form at the moment oh no no i think it broke because i could only wild tape for like what four hours and you were passed out for five hours
Zariel Torgan 00:03:44 Oh, good. I thought you were saying you were a spider with hooves on the bottom of your feet. Ugh.
Kaladen Shash 00:03:48 That's exactly what I imagined.
Dungeon Master 00:03:56 Yeah, the night shift had gone. Cletus had done spider form. You, Jesse, I had made you turn into a spider for sort of like second watch. And then you long rested. So now everything is refreshed. You guys have the benefits of the long rest. But nobody's taken a spider form in the start of the new day.
Cletus Cobbington 00:04:11 Sure. Came forward.
Zariel Torgan 00:04:16 You want to roll these for it? Alright. So you get to decide, I guess. Yeah, we should have clarified that earlier. Awesome.
Dungeon Master 00:04:34 I think Cletus gets to decide at least.
Kaladen Shash 00:04:39 Thank you. Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 00:04:40 Well, here's, okay. I want to look at Zariel. Would you like to try your druidic way of being a spider? I, my eyes, my eyes are so wide. You eat a lot of spiders. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:04:51 Yeah, I mean, I've eaten enough of them. I guess I might as well try my hand. Apparently, I wasn't under the impression that I did, but supposedly it's true. It's like a cartoon of a picnic. The answer is
Leopold Magnus 00:04:56 Oh, it is true. Leopold pulls a clay tablet out of his chest and starts counting. Oh, it's been about eight now since I've known Zariel.
Kaladen Shash 00:05:08 We were told they crawl in your mouth when you don't want them there. It happens.
Cletus Cobbington 00:05:16 Yeah, it was weird. Like, all of yesterday, your mouth was just open. I saw a lot of spiders just walk out. You weren't really talking much either. Just a dazed look. Add 15 spiders to the list. Anyways. All right. Who would
Zariel Torgan 00:05:24 Crazy. Yeah. Jesus Christ. Yeah, I'll, uh, I'll bend over and put my hands on the ground and I'll just sprout out
Leopold Magnus 00:05:32 Oh, oh, really? I'm starting to add new tallies. 15?
Dungeon Master 00:05:40 Ew.
Cletus Cobbington 00:05:45 If you would like, take a gander.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:54 four more limbs and get real fuzzy. And then as I just take shape, it's going to be a combination of every other leg is hot pink and every other leg is neon green. And then on my abdomen on my back, it's just going to say, I got a pattern, you know? Spiders have patterns. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:06:13 Like a bumper sticker?
Dungeon Master 00:06:15 It's going to say something. You sense the same thing as before.
Cletus Cobbington 00:06:22 Like a black widow symbol.
Zariel Torgan 00:06:24 It's going to say I break for the odiers on the abdomen. Yeah. Do I sense anything?
Leopold Magnus 00:06:30 It's just on the ask.
Dungeon Master 00:06:43 There seems to be like a superhighway concentration worth of spiders who, as Cletus had told you yesterday, it seems like they're going to the surface, trapping some air, and then they take it to the bottom. It seems like they're trying to sort of slowly expand the network towards the center of the city underground and like through the water.
Dungeon Master 00:07:06 So there's like that main throwaway, but then like deeper and sort of more central, there seems to be this large open space at the center of it is a very massive form. That's what you sensed. Like hundreds of thousands of times. I didn't see that.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:20 yeah yeah I was gonna say we considered poking a hole in the in the wall and just letting it drown all of these spiders have we talked have we discussed that this is my head because I'm a spider now so I can't talk but you know
Leopold Magnus 00:07:22 Oh, what do you say, Zariel? Any weak spots on these walls? Flush these little critters out with a little bit of water?
Cletus Cobbington 00:07:50 You know, that would have been a great train of thought yesterday.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:50 Do we have that up? Okay, okay. Yeah, I'm just sitting there. Maybe on the way out. Maybe on the way out. Yeah. I'm going to hip bump you with my abdomen.
Kaladen Shash 00:07:51 Yeah, we always have it up every morning. Yes, but then we won't be able to breathe long enough. We have a couple potions left. This is it. Maybe on the way. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:07:57 part of the ritual.
Leopold Magnus 00:08:05 Oh, I guess not everybody is suit armor like us, Ariel. I always forget. Just really resonates. Yeah. Well, shall we?
Zariel Torgan 00:08:21 It's just like a bell. Definitely by sea. Yeah, shit, let's do it. Since I have this web sense, do I need to roll perception or survival or anything? Or do I just kind of know exactly where to go?
Cletus Cobbington 00:08:25 The British are coming. Well, I guess...
Kaladen Shash 00:08:30 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:08:47 No, we read through it thoroughly last time. You, in real time, sense where everything is. You know the paths that are being traveled, the paths that are not being traveled. You know how to avoid. You guys can basically just tell me where you want to go in here, and you'll be able to go there.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:59 Do I get the sense as we move, if we're moving, do I get the sense that as we trek forward, they're not encroaching on us, but if we get closer to them, are they backing off and staying away? Or are they doing their thing, they're just not coming in?
Dungeon Master 00:09:27 You can give me an insight check for that. I like that question. And then tell me what you get out loud just because I'm building maps. Jesus, man. It's always 25 with you. You... It does not seem...
Zariel Torgan 00:09:31 Yeah, because that's relevant to 25. Yeah, it's a pretty good ad. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:09:44 No.
Leopold Magnus 00:09:44 It's got a plus nine.
Kaladen Shash 00:09:49 It's still a good raw number.
Dungeon Master 00:09:55 like they're avoiding you necessarily. Like you get forward and they don't seem to change their path
Dungeon Master 00:10:03 But I think logic would occur to you that you are a spider and you have spider sense. These are spiders. They likely have spider sense. And so they are not hostile towards your presence. And again, that large form, truly massive, at the center of all of the web,
Dungeon Master 00:10:26 Seems aware of your presence. There was movement discussed by Cleetus yesterday where the whole thing shifted and he had a high enough check that he could tell that it was adjusting to face that way. And it seems pretty trained on you since. So you guys are not stealthing in by any means. But at the same time, they're not avoiding you. They're not going towards you on purpose. They're just... You're just there.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:45 Gotcha. Okay. What's our rough ETA if we continue at the pace that we've continued at? Just because I know I've only got this up for so long. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:11:03 where into the center of the web, you could probably do that with like an hour. It's like, and if you sprinted there, it could be cut down by like half, you know?
Zariel Torgan 00:11:17 I guess I'll just ask, is there anything you guys want to do before we get there? I mean, we're going to be there within about an hour. Bigger than anything we've ever thought before. Right, Jonathan? The size of this thing is
Leopold Magnus 00:11:26 Oh, I'm all ready to go. Tooled up.
Kaladen Shash 00:11:31 No, I'm ready, but do you have idea how big this thing is? What are we facing? Bigger than the dragon, bigger than the T-Rex. OK.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:47 It's not comparable to anything we've seen. I mean, we're getting the vibe that it's huge. Yeah, so...
Dungeon Master 00:11:52 Yeah. Think on the scale more of the Great Fire Spirit, like that giant phoenix. This is a form that is the same size, maybe even larger than that giant dragon bird thing.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:11 Real, real, real big. I would imagine that either there's a really big tunnel out of here or getting away is going to be really easy. It's fat.
Cletus Cobbington 00:12:25 Real quick, before we keep getting closer, I want to cast Pass Without Trace on us. So maybe that'll help us not be detected, or at least help us with that. I don't know if that's going to block spider sense, but. Hm.
Dungeon Master 00:12:45 You get the sense that it wouldn't. Having experienced it yourself, it is like the tactile feedback that gives you guys away, the fact that you were stepping physically into the webbing and all of the webbing is connected. You are just instantly relaying where you are at all times. You guys could fly through it and be undetected, but you couldn't have your feet down on anything, hands on anything.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:49 We love them.
Cletus Cobbington 00:13:10 Oh, shit.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:10 You know, a cool idea could be... Oh, what were you going to say? Yeah, I was going to say... Yeah, yeah, well, or we could get, like, the Rizzlers out, and we could all produce, like, a bunch of creatures, and then it'd be harder for them to know, like, you know, which one of us are important, you know, because if it's dark and they can't see us, they can't see us.
Kaladen Shash 00:13:11 we're just oh no I was just thinking of like tapping the spider web like everything they feel we just send in Morse code all the time yeah we would look like
Leopold Magnus 00:13:21 Send some Morse code.
Kaladen Shash 00:13:38 We would look like an army. How far away can you control these things? What's the rank? So is it like you just send them down this tunnel, but then you'd never give them another command? Oh, yeah. We could totally do some sort of diversions as we approach the last 20, 30,
Dungeon Master 00:13:39 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:44 I think forever. I think it's verbal. Yeah, I think you can say go ahead. I think so. Yeah. I wouldn't.
Cletus Cobbington 00:13:46 It's infinite, really. As long as concentration is held, that's all that matters. They have their own movement. Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 00:14:08 or 10 minutes or however far we're out. There's some other tunnels. I like it.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:11 I wouldn't be able to just because I'm in spider form, so I can't cast. But once we get there, I could do something. But yeah, it's an interesting idea. Do we need any rolls or anything as we're getting closer, Jonathan? Or are we just moseying along? I'll relay the insight roll that they're not avoiding us, but they know we're there.
Dungeon Master 00:14:25 And then what you guys are doing.
Kaladen Shash 00:14:41 Yeah. I thought you can do it twice now. Once, if you do it right.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:41 I think we're just trekking. If everybody else is prepped, I'm ready to rock. Yeah. Oh, shit. I wild shaped once, so I can't do it again. Actually, if we would have, well, I can wild shape twice, but I can only fire spirit, fire elemental once with both.
Cletus Cobbington 00:14:45 Yeah. Oh, no.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:48 Make sure you bring your fire.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:09 So if we would have taken an hour-long rest right at the beginning as a spider, then I could have had two, and it would have been fine. But that's all right. Yeah, I figure we're just heading right on in, Jonathan. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:15:23 the way it is today.
Cletus Cobbington 00:15:27 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:15:32 OK. And you are the spider, correct? OK. As you guys are making your way through,
Zariel Torgan 00:15:37 Let me look up stats for a spider real quick. Night spider, there we go. Ooh, not good.
Dungeon Master 00:16:00 you do hit a point where you can't avoid the spiders. And it's like once you're in the area where they are inhabiting, you see, again, just like an endless number of them, some just on the ceiling, on the walls, on the floor, just sort of scuttering past you, like their little butt sort of bobbing as they move along their web kind of clumsily into the darkness because almost pitch black in here. You get faint sources of light.
Dungeon Master 00:16:27 from that bioluminescent fungus that grows in the webbing of the mesh of the spider webs with how thick it is. You see the root system going out, giving this ambient light. But again, huge gaps. So the spider's almost like a car under a street light at night, just goes into the light, disappears. After a while, you see its butt light up again with just a reflection of light. And that's how it is through the whole tunnel system. But you make your way towards the center.
Dungeon Master 00:16:55 And eventually you guys get to a point where Zario, as you are leading in this spider form, you get this sense from this large creature, like it's reaching out to communicate to you. And you hear, I don't know that I'm going to do it how I describe it, but in a breathy feminine sort of voice with a little bit of hoarseness to it, this voice kind of break into your mind and it goes just,
Dungeon Master 00:17:25 Who are you? That doesn't seem so.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:30 I'm going to look around and see, did anybody else hear that? Can I tell just by looking? I'm going to, before I respond, well, I don't know if she, he, it, whatever it is, they can hear me. But I'm going to tell the party, in my mind, try to be it to them. This breathy, feminine, but also rough voice.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:35 Oh, here it was, Ariel.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:59 Just ask who we are. I'm going to tell them we're the O'Dears. Unless you guys have a better idea. I do voices. This isn't my only accent. Yeah, it sounded like... It sounded just like this. Who are you? Is what it sounded like.
Cletus Cobbington 00:18:05 That's exactly what popped my mind. And wow, I feel like I heard it myself. That was a very good description. All right, let's hear it. Why?
Dungeon Master 00:18:05 Who's got Elmer the Odin, dude? I do voices crazy. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:18:07 Fascinating. Just like this. The truth is a good answer.
Leopold Magnus 00:18:22 You learn something new every day.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:30 Verbatim. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Yeah, ma'am, we are the old ears doing a little bit of spelunking. Who are you?
Cletus Cobbington 00:18:41 I'm sorry
Dungeon Master 00:18:59 you hear back after a while just almost to itself but to you just curious wandering through my divine realm coming to seek audience no doubt in search of what I hold dear
Zariel Torgan 00:19:03 It seemed apt.
Dungeon Master 00:19:29 And then it fades out and you kind of lose sort of that connection. Kind of still present, but not really. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:39 All right, yeah, I'll just say, all right, guys, I'll tell you exactly what it sounded like again, and I'll just say it again because I'm not going to remember it all. But that's exactly, you know, like a recording, how it came in. I mean, the only thing of this size we've seen was that.
Kaladen Shash 00:19:55 Just the same.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:59 Oh, what do we suppose she holds dear then?
Zariel Torgan 00:20:09 like semi-god phoenix so maybe it's some sort of like spider spirit god thing yeah it was like an egg because spiders have eggs too maybe
Cletus Cobbington 00:20:20 Later, mommy. Play a mini-age. I mean, something so precious to what is maybe divine would probably or could have something to do with this reverse water thing that's happening all over the city.
Kaladen Shash 00:20:25 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:20:27 Good night.
Leopold Magnus 00:20:44 Oh, very astute.
Zariel Torgan 00:20:45 It would be really funny. Yeah, it would be really funny if it was like a really mundane object. They just didn't know how to handle like an unending jug of water. They got tipped over and they just don't know what to do.
Cletus Cobbington 00:20:51 Might be a magical item of sorts. Maybe she wasn't the one that necessarily created it, but she's at least guarding it now. They just see infinite water and it's their holy symbol now.
Kaladen Shash 00:21:01 Yes, I like this idea. Oh my God.
Leopold Magnus 00:21:13 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:14 It's like, how do we fix this? I'm sure it'll be more epic than that, but that would be funny. It's going to be a jug. We're going to walk in and we're going to solve their problems. I want all your flies in exchange for fixing this.
Dungeon Master 00:21:18 You're lying.
Cletus Cobbington 00:21:24 No, I think you're onto something. It has to be an infinite water producing jug that's upside down. Yeah, let's rob them. Armed robbery. Mini-legged armed robbery.
Leopold Magnus 00:21:43 an eight armed robbery. Stick them up. Yeah. Can I take a sample of the spider web just for analysis later?
Zariel Torgan 00:21:45 Oh shit. That's great. Yeah. I figure we just keep on trucking. I really can't.
Cletus Cobbington 00:21:56 All right.
Dungeon Master 00:22:00 Okay. Does anybody want to do anything as you approach? Yeah, go for it. Yep.
Kaladen Shash 00:22:06 uh yeah it feels like we're gonna have a conversation with something intelligent i'm just gonna as we because all these spiders are around us just not doing anything right yep we're just gonna just look as non-threatening as i need to like no like no weapon out
Leopold Magnus 00:22:15 that in my inventory.
Cletus Cobbington 00:22:28 Yeah. So I think we should probably not amass our army if we're going in for conversation versus just confusing attack, perhaps. Nazario was able to talk to her.
Dungeon Master 00:22:30 Seems like it.
Kaladen Shash 00:22:36 Just walk in.
Cletus Cobbington 00:22:59 via spider form. So I wonder if it might be a good idea for me to also be a spider. See if that will help our odds with whether communicating or just talking with her. I'll wild shape into my spider, but
Leopold Magnus 00:23:15 I am going to cast heroism and that will be
Kaladen Shash 00:23:17 You have skill to go.
Cletus Cobbington 00:23:24 Zariel's was very smooth and colorful. Mine is yet again, very painful looking. A lot of bone, a lot of bone cracking. A lot of sand.
Dungeon Master 00:23:32 Your limbs break and snap.
Leopold Magnus 00:23:45 How many? Let's see, who do I want to do that on? I guess I can do it at a higher level, target one additional creature. Actually, I could just do it at the third level and then I'll get all of us. Anyway, so you guys will get five temporary hit points. And you'll be immune to being frightened.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:04 Oh shit. How long does it last? Oh yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:24:05 Okay. Excellent. Is that a concentration on your end? Or is that just a thing for like an hour?
Leopold Magnus 00:24:15 Yeah, it's concentration. Oh, fuck. Never mind. Well, are we going right in? Or we still got more time to walk? Okay, I'll hold that until it only lasts a minute. So I'll hold that right until we're ready to walk in. But before we do...
Cletus Cobbington 00:24:24 yeah i think yeah
Dungeon Master 00:24:24 You're not there yet. Don't move him. No, like I said, there is...
Zariel Torgan 00:24:35 Is it pitch black? Gotcha.
Dungeon Master 00:24:43 Like, it patches of this bioluminescent, like, fungi, little mushrooms. And a lot of it manifests more of, like, lichen crawling on different parts of the surfaces, both above, beside, and below you. And, like, the way it sort of presents as lichen is because the root system of the fungus is so woven into the spider web that you get, like, little stretches of light. And then there's, like, mushroom caps here. I know they get applied, too. But that's how, like, it's sort of lit all the way through.
Cletus Cobbington 00:25:02 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:25:16 I would say low light the whole time. Some areas of no sight, but those with dark vision would be able to see gray through it. Like nothing's so bad that you see only darkness.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:27 Yeah, I'm trying to decide whether or not I want to just drop this. It's only got like 20-something hit points. So I might just drop this giant spider. That's true. I kind of want to cast a buff spell or something ahead of time.
Leopold Magnus 00:25:40 What happened?
Cletus Cobbington 00:25:44 I mean, that's 20 bonus hit points if you think about it. You do you. I am now also a spider for... Yeah, I thought maybe having more of us as spiders might come in handy with talking to her more.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:58 Oh, you're a spider? Yeah. Yeah, maybe I'm playing this wrong. Yeah, maybe I'm thinking too aggressive. Okay, yeah, I'll chill as a spider with you.
Dungeon Master 00:26:08 Two spiders. You're a little bit murder, hopefully.
Cletus Cobbington 00:26:15 I can't think of negotiating perhaps, especially since she was able to talk to Olney with that. And feel free to drop it if combat happens. Drop it then or let yourself take 20 and then get a free 20 hit.
Kaladen Shash 00:26:18 Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:29 That's fair. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I am. Yeah. Yeah, I'll spider dive in front of somebody or I'll use my thing to take somebody's damage. That'll be a good use of that. All right, cool. Well, yeah, I'll just stroll on in.
Dungeon Master 00:26:39 You guys get to a certain point as you move through this sort of winding cake system of spider webs. At some point, everybody give me a...
Cletus Cobbington 00:26:51 Wait, what was that?
Leopold Magnus 00:26:52 Oh yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:27:08 perception check as you're moving through. Yes, everybody. This is for something based off your vision. 22, 23. Leopold doesn't see it, but
Zariel Torgan 00:27:13 Even the spiders? Oh, nice. Damn. Let's just run into a wall.
Leopold Magnus 00:27:24 Natural one. I'm not looking at much.
Kaladen Shash 00:27:25 Everybody rolling. Good. Get out of here, guys.
Cletus Cobbington 00:27:26 He's looking the other way.
Dungeon Master 00:27:38 Everybody sees it because of it. Leopold's sort of walking, kind of hunched, because it's not a tall space, it's just a larger space. And at some point, your armored boot clinks into something hard in the web, sort of stuck upright, and your whole form sort of falls over Teakettle, almost spilling into a spider. You get really close to it. It's just marbled black eyes as it sort of just scuttles up and past you. And then everybody looks at what you tripped on, and you see...
Dungeon Master 00:28:08 This gorgeous gold cased scroll where it's where the parchment pulls out and then goes back in. Looks untouched. Everything under... Oh, did you? I don't remember.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:20 I'll just look to Kaladin.
Cletus Cobbington 00:28:22 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:28:23 That's sparking a memory. Didn't I pick up a scroll while we were swimming? I think I was just swimming by and I just pocketed it. Okay. Okay, anyways. Separate to that, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:28:30 yes i remember that coming up
Dungeon Master 00:28:39 I'll have to check my items list for what you would have found in the area. But I do have a list, so I'll let you know. But yeah, this is another scroll. You tripped over it just now. Everybody sees it. It's like embedded in the floor, sticking up a little bit, and he just didn't see it, and so he tripped over it as he fell. And that's how everybody instantly was just like, what the fuck did you just trip on that for?
Cletus Cobbington 00:28:54 Sorry, it's just it's like on the wall or on the floor. And he saw 16 legs carefully avoid it before tripping over it.
Kaladen Shash 00:29:07 Does it have any... Is there any writing on the outside of the scroll or lettering? Is it just runes? Is it blank?
Leopold Magnus 00:29:07 It's like a rotisserie chicken spills out. A couple other things fall out.
Dungeon Master 00:29:19 That one thing. And then he trips. Yes. Written very perfectly legible in Elven across the bottom portion where the scroll of parchment pulls out. It says Map of Moonhaven.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:20 We all just stepped over it.
Cletus Cobbington 00:29:22 There's so many spider legs.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:44 Oh, dear. Oh, God. There's chicken everywhere. Oh, when I fell over, all my innards spilled out. Yeah, in the chest cavity.
Kaladen Shash 00:29:44 Excellent. You guys, you found the map. Excellent. He always keeps the rotisserie in there, you know?
Cletus Cobbington 00:29:50 It's the map. The map. The map. It's the map. All right, let's put it in our sentient backpack, and let's explore. That's a Dora the Explorer joke, guys. I'm sorry.
Dungeon Master 00:29:55 What? I missed that. I got it.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:57 oh shit yeah that's fair that was yeah that's good though
Kaladen Shash 00:30:20 Ha ha ha ha.
Cletus Cobbington 00:30:23 I just got met with blank stares. All right, we should probably take this, eh? Oh. The sentient bag of holding, the holy item. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:30:28 I think it's too close to some other D&D thing. I'm thinking, does he know some D&D thing I don't know about? I feel like it would be really judgmental of what you put in there. You know, it's like, oh, another monster head? Okay, and just opens it up.
Dungeon Master 00:30:37 He's referencing the last game. That could be something you guys can chant. That'd be funny. So glad you asked.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:45 What does the map look like? Do you have that john?
Cletus Cobbington 00:30:55 really grossed out by a lot of it. All right, we should probably
Zariel Torgan 00:30:58 Now. We.
Kaladen Shash 00:31:05 It's a score.
Dungeon Master 00:31:07 You open up the map, and you guys get this circular map. It's enchanted to be colored on just the blank parchment, but it sort of lets you know the districts and what they looked like when this map was created. That's the one that's underground.
Leopold Magnus 00:31:24 And what's going on in Kathriel? Ah, OK. Much more organic than New New Arbor, which is clearly just a slice of a pie.
Cletus Cobbington 00:31:25 Oh, Lorendo is magical as hell. Still fine, looks like home.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:28 catheter
Dungeon Master 00:31:39 Calafio.
Cletus Cobbington 00:31:58 Oh yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:01 Are there any almonds that show any of that? If you zoom in.
Leopold Magnus 00:32:01 Cool.
Dungeon Master 00:32:05 You look out, you get to that one point where you're in like a portion of tunnel that is like just air bubble underneath the water. So you're just surrounded by space around you and you're looking for an almond and it's, it's hard to see that while this area is still underwater, there's nothing but aquatic life. Cletus, you should adhere at the lack of almond trees.
Kaladen Shash 00:32:31 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 00:32:31 That's just painful. They could not have lived a wonderful life. Oh my god, I could resurrect this city, this dome. I want to be Johnny Almond Seed.
Leopold Magnus 00:32:33 Well, I think this is green fields for you. You could come here and plant all the almonds you want.
Dungeon Master 00:32:41 A fishing spot. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:44 I like the idea that the wrap-up of this campaign is us just land-grabbing. This part of the dome is mine. It's named after me. It's Zariel's Corner. And that's just the end. It's just like, landowner. Yes. Yeah, we'll all take a six. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Native people who? Nah, this is ours.
Kaladen Shash 00:33:01 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:33:03 Yeah, let's all take a district, scribble out the name and write ours instead. Smooth transition.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:15 All right. So how close are we to the big thingy? Have we heard anything lately?
Leopold Magnus 00:33:20 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:33:26 Back to where you are, you guys. You're back in the caves again. And as you delve deeper, you know, some minutes go by. Spiders get more densely populated. But you see in this area, as you get towards the center, it's like just where there are
Cletus Cobbington 00:33:47 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:33:48 huddling and grouping there are spiders that are like sleeping and like they're curled deeply and you just see like the back of their carapace all sort of like like just row after row of them on top almost as if there's like if you would see eggs like maggot eggs how they're so closely grouped together and
Dungeon Master 00:34:09 you just see all of the backs of the spiders going deeper in. And eventually, you're just kind of walking on some as they're sort of in the webbing below you, and it gets dense, and then you get onto an area of packed dirt and webbing again, and there's no spiders there. But as you delve and you keep going, and the immense source of power gets...
Dungeon Master 00:34:29 greater and greater you at one point it this voice reaches out again just barely clearly says i see now you're close enough that i i have eyes it's been long since i've seen humanoids in my realm come i wish to speak and that's the last you get as you move in
Kaladen Shash 00:34:57 And that was still only to the spiders.
Dungeon Master 00:35:00 To the spiders. Jesse, your mouth is moving, but no words, sir. No audio is going through. Oh. Who the fuck is this dude?
Cletus Cobbington 00:35:03 I'm like, so lost. Like, what?
Zariel Torgan 00:35:08 There we go. Sorry, I was just going to say, now Cletus knows that my accent of her was not spot on. Like, who could that be? Because it's not the person he was talking about. Yeah. Oh.
Kaladen Shash 00:35:29 He's like, look, a second person. Yes.
Cletus Cobbington 00:35:30 Oh, there must be two giant spiders in there. Guys, this one sounds a lot like, and I say it so perfectly. Oh, Jesus. Okay, I got a plus one. No! Do you see two?
Dungeon Master 00:35:34 Give me a performance check. DC2. Oh.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:34 Yeah, this one now is saying something different, and I'll relay it. I turn red with jealousy. I'm so upset.
Dungeon Master 00:36:00 It's so much better than what Zario did. Worlds apart. Cheers, man.
Leopold Magnus 00:36:06 Oh, Zario. You should be working on your accents, you know.
Cletus Cobbington 00:36:07 Worlds apart with a five. All right, well, she would like to speak with us. She knows we're humanoid, even though we're spiders at the moment, so.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:10 well I am a spider I don't really have vocal you know when I'm back to being a robot that'll be better shit
Cletus Cobbington 00:36:35 assumingly she was talking about all of us, but still we only heard her, so I guess we should probably still stay spiders.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:40 Yeah, I think that'd be a good plan. Probably whoever's the best talker should be out in front, too, because we might need to make ourselves seem amiable if we plan on staying that way.
Leopold Magnus 00:37:02 Well, I suppose Cyrus is our best talker, but he's been awfully quiet. How are you doing over there, chump? And I slap him on the shoulder. Oh! Well, don't worry, it happens to all adventurers after they get settled in, you know? You get a stomach bug and next thing you know...
Dungeon Master 00:37:12 I have massive diarrhea. Yeah, I can't really focus right now. It's just really taking up all my thought. I can make...
Zariel Torgan 00:37:15 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:37:26 you you
Cletus Cobbington 00:37:27 My stomach hurts. It hurts real bad. Hey! Hey! You take that back. There's no way it was the ultimate. I mean, Bard is high charisma, correct? Yeah, that might be...
Leopold Magnus 00:37:33 Some bad almonds. Maybe it was that moist one that Cletus has been giving you. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:37:41 I can make roles as Cyrus if you guys need it because the bard is an important role, but we'll just see how necessary he is. Yes, I will use his role. That's fair.
Zariel Torgan 00:37:55 they're good yeah we'll give it a shot all right yeah I'll just roll up do we get to a point we start seeing something funky
Cletus Cobbington 00:37:57 might be necessary for some persuasion. So I guess, I mean, we will talk, but if we need a role, maybe we bank on that.
Dungeon Master 00:38:15 Yeah, you guys, the mouth of the tunnel slowly widens. And you do get to a point...
Dungeon Master 00:38:24 where even your dark vision isn't showing you anything. There's very little light in this dark room that you enter. You sort of step out into this space where there's not even really a ledge. It's like this tunnel opens up perfectly flush with this huge column of spider web just going so deep into the earth, it disappears below your vision.
Leopold Magnus 00:38:44 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:38:54 And you don't see anything at this moment. And then very slowly, from beyond what you can see below, a little light just sort of starts trickling up through the air. And standing, or sort of, I guess, huddling around you, you see...
Dungeon Master 00:39:14 a spider leg larger in thickness than your entire torso sort of perched in one spot like the thickness is bigger than any person's body this huge shape as taking up most of this very enormous cavern you see this grotesque spider shape just sort of huddled and crouched into the top looking down
Cletus Cobbington 00:39:27 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:39:42 eyeballs bigger than your entire body sort of stare unblinking as you guys enter and you see each of you instead of being a normal spider face like as far as far as like the eye distribution there is one huge black eye in the center that reflects almost magically and then the other eyes sort of round out beside it
Dungeon Master 00:40:10 And without words audibly being spoken, the shape looks at you. And you all hear in your head at this point, as you sort of enter its range. And it speaks again, this time only saying, You found your way to the center. But I ask now what you seek.
Cletus Cobbington 00:40:22 Yeah, we all heard.
Kaladen Shash 00:40:45 Do we all hear that? Or is it still on the spire? In our telepathic bond, I'm like, what do we seek from this area? Are we assuming this is something to do with the water? How do you tell her this?
Dungeon Master 00:40:47 Yes, I'll hear it.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:06 Well, I suppose based on what the spider said, they're looking for something valuable too. Maybe we could kind of allude to that.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:16 Wasn't there also like a pull that you got to come here? Oh, this is different. Well, we could...
Kaladen Shash 00:41:22 Not to this exact spot. But I was feeling like a pulse. I was feeling a pulse of energy that was quickening as we were getting closer to it as we started much further away. And then as we went towards this tunnel, just like Jonathan said, it was kind of branching off to this, like the pulse was off to the side.
Cletus Cobbington 00:41:42 I guess I can off that. Sorry, you were pulled to that tablet that made you pass out. Was that like the end of the pull? OK.
Kaladen Shash 00:41:52 Oh, that's a great question. Was that the end of the poll, Jonathan? Okay, perfect. Then, yeah, I succeeded on that side quest checkbox already. I got that crazy vision. That was the end of that. We just have to keep going.
Dungeon Master 00:41:58 Yes. Yeah. Calvin has it floating in his head that he might be the heir to the Pharaoh. Oh, that's a pretty big thing. One of the things you're doing.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:59 Well...
Leopold Magnus 00:42:15 I think we're looking more or less for the source of the water, right? Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:42:20 Yes, what's drawing this in? Of course, worse.
Cletus Cobbington 00:42:21 Yeah. Why so wet, Miss Queen? That's awful. Yeah, I mean, she's been pretty, you know, they haven't just outright attacked us at all. Just...
Zariel Torgan 00:42:24 Yeah. Yeah, I figure we shoot with honesty. Just, you know, be like, we're looking for, you know, why so wet? You know. You've been chill. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:42:35 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:42:49 We've walked past a thousand spiders already. I don't think we need to be hostile. Who has the best speaking voice? Who's got all the charisma? Here's mine. What am I at? I'm a plus zero.
Cletus Cobbington 00:42:51 Yeah. Yeah, might as well. We're here. What happened? I have plus one.
Leopold Magnus 00:43:03 Got a plus five going on. I don't know what... Oh, damn. Damn, dude. He's stacked.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:09 Yeah, plus zero. You're plus zero? Cards are ridiculous.
Dungeon Master 00:43:11 Whoever wants to talk, because again, Travis isn't here. You can all use Travis's persuasion bonus. So you'd get a plus 11 on a persuasion check or a five on a deception check.
Cletus Cobbington 00:43:26 What the hell? I was so much higher than I thought. OK. OK, well. I mean, why don't we just?
Kaladen Shash 00:43:28 He's all charisma there. Okay. That's really hard.
Dungeon Master 00:43:40 He's just not here, so who wants to talk in his character's place, essentially, but as yourself? Very funk. It's so hard. The country act that ruins every accident.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:44 Got to do the voice. 100%. Got to do it.
Leopold Magnus 00:43:48 Cannot do the Cyrus voice. Oh, well, to be honest, we're just here looking for the source of the water. We've been sent on a mission.
Cletus Cobbington 00:43:54 It's so hard after doing just country accents. It's so hard to switch. It's hard to not keep going back. I mean, see? It just goes right back.
Kaladen Shash 00:44:02 Yes. It's a diplomatic mission. That's all.
Dungeon Master 00:44:22 That's you. You say the voice brings out again in your head, not audible. This is just a large, very eerily silent spider form. You hear the body sway and like big movements can be heard, but like no other noise. And it goes, yes,
Leopold Magnus 00:44:24 Yep, that's what I'll say.
Zariel Torgan 00:44:29 diplomatic immunity
Kaladen Shash 00:44:32 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:44:52 The water's incredibly difficult in establishing my kingdom. We seek to deal with it as well, but you serve no other purpose. And that almost sounds quizzical when like they was expecting you to be looking for something else.
Leopold Magnus 00:45:14 Bye.
Cletus Cobbington 00:45:25 Yeah. I mean, there's that or we
Zariel Torgan 00:45:25 Maybe we play our cards a little close and say something like, I don't know, like, how do we know we can trust you? A giant mythical spider creature with whatever secret we have, because they clearly have something they want us to know about. I don't know. Just a thought.
Cletus Cobbington 00:45:52 doubled down into a lie. I don't know. It's like, we're two spiders. We, you know, say something like, um, we've come to seek your, your, your wise words. Oh, spider queen. I mean, I don't know where we, what that gets us though. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:46:11 Right through it. Right through it.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:14 Yeah, we could do that. I feel like she probably would know we're not real spiders. I mean, because it's just, you know... I'm bright pink and yellow and green, and I have words written on my abdomen, so that's not a very naturally occurring thing.
Cletus Cobbington 00:46:23 yes yeah that's probably better yeah and i just look like an almond but with eight legs
Dungeon Master 00:46:36 um you guys look down at this moment like you have this again silent conversation where you're like oh we're spiders you look at yourselves and it hits you you're not spiders your forms are dropped right now but you don't know when it happened even all fours
Leopold Magnus 00:46:52 Odd thing for you to do, Zara.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:54 Stand back up then.
Kaladen Shash 00:46:57 He's like, oh, he's like, oh.
Cletus Cobbington 00:46:59 I was wondering who clicked and clacked in.
Dungeon Master 00:47:06 And beyond that, and other people in the party, you would, when this sort of gets brought up, and you don't know when it happened, but at some point the magic sort of stopped working for Zariel and Cletus, you go like an inner check in everything that you own that's supposed to be magical, not currently working.
Zariel Torgan 00:47:29 Fuck me. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, no. Oh, shit. I wonder if it's the eye. Can I try something? I just want to, like,
Kaladen Shash 00:47:30 oh excellent a giant a giant area of this spell magic okay cool cool cool it's it's late it's it could be the eye as it was reflective it could be a layer action perhaps also giant microphone
Leopold Magnus 00:47:34 Anti-magic field, yeah. Oh! Well, uh...
Dungeon Master 00:47:55 Are you guys going to sit in an awkward silence while you do something else? I wanted to sort of ask the question.
Zariel Torgan 00:48:03 Well, I was going to. Well, yeah, I was going to say something. Oh, go ahead. Mm hmm.
Kaladen Shash 00:48:06 No, I will answer. I was going to say, if you want to move around, I can try to answer. He asked if we served any other purpose than just trying to figure out the source of the water. Right, John, that was the post-question last minute.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:22 Yep.
Cletus Cobbington 00:48:23 I mean there's also like what's the harm of just asking you know like is there something we should know kind of thing and see if she's
Dungeon Master 00:48:24 Yes, that's what your guys' purpose is, but it seemed curious that there wasn't something else. And oddly, I would say, if everybody wants to give me an insight check,
Cletus Cobbington 00:48:54 I don't know if dumb enough is the right way to say it, but, you know, open enough to like, or proud enough to just tell us what like she's about.
Kaladen Shash 00:49:04 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:09 I feel like there's two options. Either this is a pretty chill spider and they'll tell us either way. Or they're going to be like, well, I'm not going to tell you my cool secrets if you don't even know what I am and why I'm here. You're just some randos. But I mean, they're both good options.
Cletus Cobbington 00:49:24 Yeah. Blend in with the wall, sidestep.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:33 If somebody's going to say something, then I won't. Otherwise, I want to just try to slightly, just slowly move to the side a little bit, just real casually. I'll start bending over to tie my shoe, and then I'll just stand up. But I will have moved a step over.
Kaladen Shash 00:49:45 Well, while he's casually moving, I'll try to speak to the spider and distract her. We were sent by our own nations to check on this area.
Dungeon Master 00:49:52 How far is Zario casually trying to move? What do you think?
Kaladen Shash 00:50:14 We noticed it was full of water and our secondary mission was to just get rid of it. How else can we help?
Dungeon Master 00:50:26 help rings out as it speaks back. And Zaria, how far are you going while this response is happening? Yes. Great question.
Zariel Torgan 00:50:34 I'm remembering as he was talking, you said we were at like a sheer cliff in an opening. So how far could I move? I mean, is there even enough space for me to get? Is it like a 10 foot opening or is it like a pretty wide opening or? I was a spider, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:50:45 Is it just a tunnel? Were spiders forced?
Dungeon Master 00:50:54 it is incredibly sticky. So like in theory, well, you're a spider. Oh, you were a spider. You could like, like think of it like, I did say it was like cone slash column shape. So there's a little bit of like slope to it. Like the rigging on a boat kind of netting where like you could sort of hang and climb to the side, but it won't be like,
Zariel Torgan 00:51:11 Yeah. I try something a little different that's probably really dumb.
Kaladen Shash 00:51:21 Casually.
Dungeon Master 00:51:21 That's why I made a point of calling it how casual it is. It would look, it would be so noticeable of you, like, they're having a conversation. The spider is very obviously looking at all of you at once because it's so large, and you would just, like, start to disappear out of eyesight as it was focusing. That was so cute.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:41 I'd like to pretend to accidentally fall off the edge. Oh, deception? I'm great at falling, though. I do it all the time. Oh, I do? All right, so that's 16.
Dungeon Master 00:51:50 Give me a deception check. Yeah. I rolled over here, um,
Cletus Cobbington 00:51:52 So.
Kaladen Shash 00:51:54 You get a plus five. You get a plus five. Yeah. Oh, not again.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:07 I just want to reach over and tighten an ankle bolt. And then he's like, oh, oh, oh lordy. And then I just fall off.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:08 Can I give a performance check to make it look a little more believable? Give him a plus two to that.
Dungeon Master 00:52:21 No need. I rolled in person to see what would happen. You fall and it looks pretty sold. So you start to go and you're sort of falling quicker than you'd like and like some moisture is hitting your face as you're falling. You're like, oh shit, I'm going far. And then this huge lake sort of just
Dungeon Master 00:52:41 perched from somewhere on the webbing holding its massive weight up sort of swoops in and you land hard on the huge carapace and it's so big that like the individual leg hairs that spider have are like thick enough that you can get purchase on it and hold yourself from falling as this leg pearls and pulls you back up to the party and you were sort of very gently with a lot of a very slight of hand like very careful and dexterous
Zariel Torgan 00:52:58 I don't wanna. Did anything...
Dungeon Master 00:53:11 places you back down, and you hear the leg with a whoosh, just down into the darkness again. Mm-hmm. Um, yes. You, um...
Kaladen Shash 00:53:19 Thank you. He's always falling down.
Leopold Magnus 00:53:23 Oh, very clumsy, that one.
Cletus Cobbington 00:53:25 So clumsy.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:26 light did anything light up did my magic shield light up at any point out of out of the eye line of this creature you know i felt a decent distance yeah just rough
Dungeon Master 00:53:41 It's hard to get an exact thing because you were falling so fast, but there was a point when the spider and your whole party are sort of disappearing into the darkness above you because there's a little bit of light source somewhere distantly below you giving ambience and effect. The spider's got some theatrics, but it's dark at the top.
Dungeon Master 00:54:02 And so you're looking up and everything disappears into darkness pretty quick. And at some point you feel your enchantment surge and you instantly sprout all of your legs. Like the anti-magic effect wasn't dispelling, but it was temporarily blocking. And so you hit a point where you fall out and all your magic resumes and then you're picked up, brought up and you hit a certain point where you were just robotic Zarya again.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:20 Yeah. Can I function in an anti-magic field? Is that a thing? OK, just curious. All right. Yeah, I'll just throw out a number to the group in the mind chat.
Cletus Cobbington 00:54:20 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:54:40 You're a living creature, yeah. Just because I don't know the specifics of how we would work in a cone shape, a 150-foot cone is large.
Kaladen Shash 00:54:40 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:49 I'll just say whatever it seemed closest to, like 50 feet, 100 feet, whatever it was. Just so they know.
Dungeon Master 00:55:05 And so whatever the dispersion of that is what the number he would have told you. This spider's got a large perspective and field of view. And then at this time, it was speaking to Kaladin. And so it continues.
Zariel Torgan 00:55:18 Yeah, yeah. I'll just, I'll just, as he picks me back up, I'll let him, or she, they, picks me back up. I'll let the party know.
Kaladen Shash 00:55:35 Not entirely. I had told it that we had been sent here by our own because she was forming some sort of nation, she said, or her own realm or whatever. So I just said that we had come from our own as we had communicated here once before and that we were just looking to see or find out why it was flooded.
Dungeon Master 00:55:36 And I forget what it had said last, but what did you said exactly to you? Do you remember your exact wording? You would. Mm hmm.
Kaladen Shash 00:56:06 How can we help?
Dungeon Master 00:56:06 Gotcha. Okay. Interesting.
Dungeon Master 00:56:13 In the realm of the great omniscient eye, we share a purpose with different paths. And you hear large clacking as its mandibles sort of adjust and the hard teeth sort of scrape against each other. And you hear, my brood and I are hungry. But...
Dungeon Master 00:56:41 I pride myself on maintaining a piece of my humanity coming from a giant spider. An exchange of information and a safe path. If you indulge a trial, the cost is your lives, the reward is great.
Dungeon Master 00:57:11 And that is all you get. I was once long ago
Kaladen Shash 00:57:12 Let's just say it on our private channel. That doesn't sound good. Let us...
Leopold Magnus 00:57:13 Ooh. Sure. One question for you, Mrs. Spider. What do you know about humanity?
Cletus Cobbington 00:57:23 High risk, high reward.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:33 question.
Dungeon Master 00:57:41 A hungry child in a dystopian city. But I fed and I grew and I fed and I grew. And then I gained power. A very vague statement. I gained seat and I gained soldiers. And when everything ended, I took this land.
Dungeon Master 00:58:11 Moonhaven is my realm. You are trespassing. What I know about humanity is that you are tasty. And you hear the large clacks of the mandibles again.
Leopold Magnus 00:58:29 Well, I'm glad you're keeping some of that humanity. And I send to the private chat, I don't have a good feeling about this.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:33 Out of game, I feel like this is an instance where Jonathan wants us to try to do something cool.
Kaladen Shash 00:58:41 Let us try to share as little information as possible. We'll see how we do. We will negotiate safe travel. Don't worry.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:02 Where he wants us to participate in some... No? You don't want... Yeah. Hmm. Hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 00:59:03 All right.
Dungeon Master 00:59:04 there is something cool there is something you can do but also i like that you brought up um the alternative of maybe we uh negotiate an escape instead of trial by death i hadn't thought about that's interesting do what you guys are going to do
Kaladen Shash 00:59:30 We will leave no matter what.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:33 Oh, well, you suppose we'd rather escape than just, you know, put an end to this giant creature?
Zariel Torgan 00:59:42 I feel like we're going to... I have a feeling that this is a lot like the werewolf situation where we only got away because we put like a wall up and tunneled out. Whereas here, even if we did somehow kill this creature, there's like a billion spiders and one way out.
Cletus Cobbington 00:59:43 Yeah, something tells me we're not putting an end to this creature.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:12 I mean, I guess we could just poke a hole in the web somewhere and swim, but I guess that actually would work okay. We really did want to do it. Interesting. Gotcha.
Dungeon Master 01:00:21 Where you are right now is subterranean. So there's stone around you.
Kaladen Shash 01:00:23 Too far. We're in the district that's underground now. So that escape plan does not work. She said exchange of knowledge.
Cletus Cobbington 01:00:28 I mean, there's. You could see about negotiating, I mean. She also wants the water. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:35 Well, you had turned into a badger before and tunneled us out. I have to be loose earth.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:42 Yeah. Yeah, worst case scenario, we just got a fight, and that's actually the best case scenario, so... Works for me. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:00:52 yes let us have a let us have a chat we'll tell her our true intentions if it's helpful for us
Cletus Cobbington 01:01:08 yeah there's not much just casually strolling out of here at this point um
Kaladen Shash 01:01:21 What exchange of knowledge do you seek? Bob?
Dungeon Master 01:01:30 it resonates again and goes no I'm misunderstanding I require sustenance or entertainment I give and exchange information
Cletus Cobbington 01:02:00 We get the information. I was going to say chipped in.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:04 And not the bard.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:04 also i see so we entertain you you tell us what we want with do you understand i guess it doesn't matter if we ask questions she's not going to answer anything until we we feed her or entertain her
Leopold Magnus 01:02:19 Leopold's going to do a little tap dance routine. Let's start. Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click. Yeah. See how that goes over. Roll for performance.
Cletus Cobbington 01:02:29 Chip does a little almond juggle On my shoulder Yeah
Kaladen Shash 01:02:39 No.
Dungeon Master 01:02:39 No. You can't tap dance on a spider web. That doesn't work.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:46 You know, we might broach the idea with it that if we are successful in stopping this water issue, that the realm of man will be here with all of its abilities. And it's going to happen even if she kills us. So broaching some sort of deal where we can coexist in some fashion probably would be the best solution.
Cletus Cobbington 01:03:15 I mean, we're both after the same thing, seemingly. He wants to walk on as well. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:16 Unless... Yeah, we all just want to live. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:03:21 We could ask how we can entertain her. I'll ask that. Oh, so what kind of entertainment are you interested in? I know a few little ditties. I'm happy to do a routine.
Dungeon Master 01:03:25 the whole body turns to you quickly in the huge whiff of space the whole web vibrates back and forth and it goes you will entertain us
Leopold Magnus 01:03:47 Oh, yeah. What exactly does... What passes for entertainment around here? I'm going to pull up three stooges. No, I'm kidding. Oh, um...
Dungeon Master 01:03:54 The whole face gets close to you, wishing it just so you can only see one large sort of shining iridescent eye. And it goes, powerful you seem. How many of my young could you kill?
Zariel Torgan 01:04:04 Yes.
Leopold Magnus 01:04:19 Well, I wouldn't want to pass any judgment, but that's a bit strange entertainment, you know, killing your children. Well, you know, you claim to know something about humanity, and well, from the human's perspective, that's a bit odd.
Dungeon Master 01:04:32 It doesn't really move a whole lot, but it goes, says who?
Dungeon Master 01:04:50 you see all these spiders like waiting at the periphery at all spots, sort of scuttling and encroach. And the spider, like almost as if it could look at it, it can't, the eyes are fixed, but it just sort of like moves as if it's looking and it goes monsters bent to feed and spread loyal to me instead. Thought of that on the spot. You guys, aren't you pretty proud? Um,
Zariel Torgan 01:05:16 That was nice. That was good.
Cletus Cobbington 01:05:16 That's good. That was good.
Kaladen Shash 01:05:17 I do.
Dungeon Master 01:05:19 Keep moving. And it goes, no, individual lives don't matter in the hive. I want to feed, but I like a challenge. I once obtained a rank of general.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:32 Hmm. Okay. Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:05:48 through power and it's been long since these bones have moved and your large creaks of the form move she goes if you are worthy battle of power i'll gift you my source and you'll be on your way but if you lose
Dungeon Master 01:06:14 And you hear just that chattering of the teeth again. And not just two. There's multiple. There's the big, huge fangs. And you hear something behind sort of clacking. And out of game, we'll go meta on it. Basically, this will just be a little fun side gig. How this is going to work is you guys will have a round where you will still have to hit. You'll still have to roll to hit on AC. But this is essentially like you guys are going to
Dungeon Master 01:06:44 exhibit throw on an exhibition of your absolute highest damage output because through cleave rules it'll be like how many spiders can you kill in a single turn and if it is impressive enough you guys if you compete in this will get some information and you'll be let along your way if you'd like um
Dungeon Master 01:07:10 If you do a high enough damage, she is offering to challenge you as like the next step up. And one of the legs shifts and curls down and you see like stuck in the web, very conveniently placed are like these beautifully glowing potions of bright pinks, purples, and reds. She goes, I am not a cruel sovereign.
Dungeon Master 01:07:39 From the war I've stashed these. Grant you full power at but a sip. Would not rob myself of a challenge. One of you at a time is going to be like, this is how much I can do.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:55 So do we get the impression that this is an individual challenge, not necessarily a group thing? I was going to say, I could just polymorph somebody into a T-Rex or a giant ape or something.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:56 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:08:12 You just need to go great ape and just go bowling. Well, I don't think... Will we have our opportunity to use magic? Can we tell? Because right now my sword's magic. That's not going to work. My spells won't go if it's all dispel.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:25 And they do ungodly damage every turn. But I don't know. I don't know if that would
Dungeon Master 01:08:43 You can bring that up for sure.
Kaladen Shash 01:08:49 Okay. Okay, so we're thinking let's try this challenge. We all think we can impress this lady with damage. Yes.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:59 Well, I would like to do my tap dance routine but I get the impression she's not interested.
Zariel Torgan 01:09:00 Here, just step it on spiders. By the way, I'm just going to say, this would be a great trick to get us to use all of our good shit, and then the big bad just comes in and just mercs us. Like, oh, you used all your big spells? Okay. Just saying. Just saying.
Cletus Cobbington 01:09:07 Unless that tapping kills a lot of spiders. Do we smell like a wolf?
Kaladen Shash 01:09:26 Oh, you just dumped them? Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:09:30 So just for when that happens. Shit.
Dungeon Master 01:09:31 You don't have to do it. Open to discussion. In fact, hold up. I'll give you guys, talk it over for a second. I'm going to smoke a bit, say hi to Hannah. Weigh your options. I like what you guys had said. You're looking for a way out instead. That's great. You're looking for information. Cool. Your sort of compromise, I think, is interesting. Again, I did design it one way, but this is like non-urgent.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:38 I think we should do it
Dungeon Master 01:10:00 If that makes sense, like you guys also brought up the point of you could like threaten it and be like, well, if you kill us, more is going to happen. And like all of that, I think is great. So why don't you guys settle on something? I'll give you way more time, even though in character, it'll be just for the moment. And I'll be right back.
Kaladen Shash 01:10:18 um i don't have a super impressive like thing what potions what oh you mean we have a potion that's equivalent to our long rest is that what you're talking about maybe
Leopold Magnus 01:10:20 Those potions seem like they'd be strong. Those potions said that he said they'd give us a full power up. So like you're concerned about blowing all your good stuff. Maybe they would, you know, freshen us up. Well, I'm not sure. That's just what the spider offered. Yeah, stat boost maybe.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:23 Well,
Cletus Cobbington 01:10:42 Or it gives you like a stat increase or something.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:46 My impression was he said it was an old world potion, which Kaladin, you drank an old world potion that grew a new arm. That's what I think it is. I think it's something along those lines, that level of, you know. Yeah. Yeah. So if we don't. Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Kaladen Shash 01:10:54 arm right yeah it could be a permanent stat change or something like that um we as far as like damages go I can cast like some aoe stuff but like I don't have like I can't spell and then bonus action like melee attack yet
Leopold Magnus 01:10:55 Yeah, that's true. It's pretty powerful. I think it's worth it.
Cletus Cobbington 01:11:20 Yeah. Having the same boat.
Kaladen Shash 01:11:25 I could do burning hands at third level, which isn't bad, but it doesn't do a ton of damage. I could swing my sword twice, but I'm only hitting two people. I don't have a sweeping attack or anything. I could do shatter. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:26 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:37 The only thing I could do would be polymorph as far as a lot of damage. Which, if we were to... Oh, go ahead.
Cletus Cobbington 01:11:48 The one thing, though, for Kaladin is Kaladin's still under the roasted almonds. So if you hit, I can make your thing crit. So that could balance you out to buff you. Right.
Kaladen Shash 01:11:59 Oh, you could make me a crit. Oh, that's great. That's going to be helpful. I was thinking about casting. That's cool, because I think I was going to cast enlarge. And then maybe my attack is just doing bonus action, stop trick blast, and then two melees. And if one of the melees hits, then you can make that the crit. Because I would deliver upwards of maybe like 50 points that way if I roll well.
Cletus Cobbington 01:12:21 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:12:28 I think the only thing I could do that's really strong would be just upcasting Thunder Wave for AoE. Otherwise, I'm just swinging my sword. And I got Bond Pressure. Yeah. Otherwise, I'm just swinging swords, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:12:34 You always... And you'd have... I don't know what you guys are going to say. I'm sure you can use Bone Crusher as part of that action economy. Someone should be the giant ape, though, because that's just like bowling. All these spiders are in the way, and you just get to throw a giant boulder. It's just like... Right?
Zariel Torgan 01:12:43 I would imagine, yeah. Pick up one spider.
Leopold Magnus 01:12:57 Yeah, that would be really powerful. 6d10, that's better than my 5d8.
Cletus Cobbington 01:12:59 Just for flavor, too. Yeah. I mean, if we're allowed to use magic, max I do is a 6d10 spell, which obviously can do really good, but also has potential to do really bad. So yeah. So I mean, whoever has potential for less, let's get them as the eight.
Kaladen Shash 01:13:03 Like on aggregate, we'd have to get it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, about. I mean, it's a 31 average.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:22 yeah so what I've got here yeah I've got here for a T-Rex so the giant ape does 76 plus 6 but you only get 1 and so a T-Rex gets 2 attacks per round a bite in the tail
Kaladen Shash 01:13:28 I think as long as one of mine crit, I'm good. That was a good point out.
Cletus Cobbington 01:13:34 Yeah. Right. So that for sure.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:50 The bite does 4d12 plus 7. The tail does 3d8 plus 7. And so that's 4d12 plus 3d8 plus 14 versus just 76 plus 6. Just 48.
Cletus Cobbington 01:14:04 Yeah. Is.
Kaladen Shash 01:14:05 they're about they're the exact same it's like 84 or 82. it's good see there are you have a little more fun you'd have a little more fun describing like you said 48 right or 40 12 right 48 and then another 30 3d 10 78 plus 14. so i guess a little more it's actually 92.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:29 So yeah, so the total for the rock attack for the ape is 76 plus 6, which is 48. Yeah, it's only 48 damage. But then 4d12 plus 3d8 is 48 plus 24, which is 62 plus 14, which is like 70-something, 74-ish. So it's like an average of...
Kaladen Shash 01:14:38 682. Yep. Yep.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:58 you know, 10 or 15 more per round. But I guess my main question is, when he says it's a group versus individual challenge, is it like, okay, now you go. Okay, now you go. Because if that's the case, hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:15:09 I think it is. I think we're all going to step up and we're essentially going to have little spider mannequins to punch at. She's just going to let some of her brood die. Yeah, damage is on aggregate. We want to do well. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:15:14 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think we all get a chance, but I think it's... What I've interpreted was, you know, we all have a turn, but then it's, like, all collectively us versus the spider. Yeah. It's not just, like, if one person...
Zariel Torgan 01:15:35 Gotcha. Okay. Well, my only thought was is if it's individual, I could do Polymorph on somebody else, and then I could do something different. But if it's separate individual, then I could cast Polymorph on somebody else, and then drop it, and then do something for myself. Because I really can't do a lot of damage without something like that. Go back.
Cletus Cobbington 01:15:44 Yeah. Right. Sure. I mean, he has decent historic is pretty good. Yeah. And he gets what? Two attacks.
Kaladen Shash 01:15:57 No, yeah. You could do a polymorph. What is Cyrus? His sword attacks are great. Yeah. Two attacks right now. Is he taking this? Is that a bard thing?
Dungeon Master 01:16:16 Dex has got fine damage. He doesn't have Divine Spite yet. Which, if he did, would... It's a paladin thing, which is what he multiclassed into. But he gets it next level, so...
Cletus Cobbington 01:16:23 He hasn't done anything crazy.
Kaladen Shash 01:16:28 I know that. Cool. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:16:37 Currently, Cyrus, I think, is like middle pack, not as a trash to him, but he's in that multi-class space where bars are not powerful yet, but his multi-class isn't powerful yet. But like next level, Cyrus will be the single highest damaging output person in the party. And then I'll explain how it works mechanically just so everybody knows.
Kaladen Shash 01:16:58 is going to grow real quick.
Dungeon Master 01:17:06 this will be sort of relayed to you you will take turns one at a time so you can buff each other up to do something extra but you'll have three rounds of action economy to do the highest cumulative damage you can and if a damage threshold is broken by one single person this monster offered to
Dungeon Master 01:17:35 challenge you as worthy and hinted at the potions in the webbing are like um restoration put you back up to full so that when she challenged you you guys were fresh because um she wants the most power possible but you don't have to so if you just did the challenge thing um
Dungeon Master 01:18:04 did all this damage, killed them, and then it was like, yeah, this is good, and then you guys were like, cool, we're going to go head out, and then you talk your way out of it somehow. There is a break in between, so you don't have to see it start to finish if you don't want to. There's a fun part one and a not-so-fun part two if you want to avoid it. Only one of you has to break the challenge.
Kaladen Shash 01:18:23 And so if she finds us worthy, is it individually us? Like she'd only fight one of us or would she fight us collectively? Yeah, what's the point?
Cletus Cobbington 01:18:27 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:18:34 and then you can all fight her. But at least one person has to be strong enough in her mind to be worth challenging. Otherwise, what's the point?
Zariel Torgan 01:18:59 So we're thinking we buff one person then?
Kaladen Shash 01:19:03 Well, if it's one at a time, we can try to add as many buffs to that person just to help them get through their round, right? They get three action economy to produce as much damage as they can. Okay, even better. That's fun.
Dungeon Master 01:19:05 Each person's going to have a chance. Yeah. Yeah, so the spell creatures, you're just going to roll damage on a spell because the saves won't be necessary. The benefit of the spells, but obviously that takes up a full turn in general.
Dungeon Master 01:19:33 to hit you would just roll an attack roll on like a low ac if you miss obviously you miss like if you roll on that one you're gonna not do damage but every time you hit that damage would count and you've got you know three actions so for most people six attacks three bonus actions three rounds of things like you can buff one two and three kind of deal
Kaladen Shash 01:19:56 So we don't really need to roll to hit either if there's no save. We're really just rolling damage. That's what we're feeling out.
Dungeon Master 01:20:02 Just a chance to show off. You're trying to hit an AC of 10.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:12 Hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 01:20:27 rolling the hit with ax but not sure
Kaladen Shash 01:20:32 okay great so we'll still roll it's just a very low hit okay other other questions are there if i hit if i hit multiple targets in an aoe
Dungeon Master 01:20:33 Yeah. So if you roll an at one, I think you all have a bonus that gets you to at least 10 on the lowest. Maybe not, but in general, then you're always going to hit. That's why the spells auto succeed too. But if you do fail, you fail. Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:21:00 Are you counting cumulative damage across multiple baddies? Okay. All right. That answers that. All right, cool.
Dungeon Master 01:21:05 No, it's damage rolls. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:21:15 Jonathan, I have a question for you. You said that we could kind of choose to take stress points at certain times. Can I take a stress point to juice up one of my attacks? Yeah. Something like that, yeah. I think that would put me at five. Yeah, exactly.
Kaladen Shash 01:21:32 Like to get a crit. I think he might be flirting a five. Ooh, ooh. Milestone stress point.
Dungeon Master 01:21:36 Is that number, what is that number for you, stress points wise? Cool. Cool, cool, cool. Love it. Okay. Do you want to go first then?
Leopold Magnus 01:21:46 I can go whenever. But yeah, that would put me at five. I can think a little bit. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:22:00 you
Dungeon Master 01:22:01 Okay, I've got something in mind for you. So when it's your turn, let me know. Who wants to go first? You guys can roll these for me. It doesn't matter. Everybody's going to go. Everybody's going to roll for highest damage. Just some chance to roll some dice.
Kaladen Shash 01:22:14 That's fun. We can roll these. I'll throw out a, we'll just all roll a 20. Three action, three action. I might go, I might go first.
Leopold Magnus 01:22:22 Can I go into this with a magic stones up? Can you precast spells? Oh, okay. Okay. Got it. Let me roll here.
Dungeon Master 01:22:26 no i gave that to you guys in gauntlet and i think it made it way too easy so starts when it starts oh not 20 didn't you just call that did you did you pre-call a nat 20
Zariel Torgan 01:22:42 So I was getting chips for a second. Did we say that we're at three rounds? OK.
Kaladen Shash 01:22:46 yeah no it was already on there that's what that's why i said that i already rolled it and i was like no i'm gonna go first yeah three action three rounds
Leopold Magnus 01:22:51 He was saying that I could quit.
Dungeon Master 01:22:57 We'll see what Cyrus gets. You get three rounds of action economy. So if you're using attack actions, you know, it's average is like six, three bonus actions, three rounds of things you can do if you've got ways to buff yourself.
Dungeon Master 01:23:21 Or you could maybe even use your turn to buff the person after you. So I don't know. The person, each person ahead has kind of a harder decision of do you spend it on yourself or do you spend it on somebody else?
Zariel Torgan 01:23:33 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:23:33 Also worth thinking about. But then it is the highest damage output as damage rolls. So Brent had asked about if you fight like maybe Firebolt and AoE, does he get damage on each one that he hits? No, because in theory, there's an innumerable amount of spiders. So it's the damage on the attacks. If you're rolling to hit, it's an AC of 10. If you're doing spell AoE, it's just damage roll. You don't have to worry about like saves.
Zariel Torgan 01:23:59 Even though it's three rounds, we're looking for the single most in a round to break, not accumulate. Oh. OK. Cool. Well, then let's do it. Oh, yeah. Now let's do it.
Kaladen Shash 01:24:04 no no that's that's your three best in three rounds there's a magic number yeah um yeah i rolled the drill time
Dungeon Master 01:24:06 Not single attack, but single... Yeah, it's like your total damage is added up. Whoever is the highest, hopefully it's above the damage threshold that you have to have. And it's just sort of listening over, but it's going to be Kaladin.
Kaladen Shash 01:24:29 So this will work out really well. I'm going to roll to hit. I'm going to cast a chromatic orb. I guess I'll step up. So I guess we'll just announce that we're... We'll start this challenge. Let us... Are you not entertained? Yes. Let me show you what I'm capable of, but you must close your big eye like it's ruining my vibe, okay?
Cletus Cobbington 01:24:38 We accept the challenge. Before we do anything.
Dungeon Master 01:24:47 You see, did you guys want to ask about the magic field? You see the aura, it's almost fades and the whole spider form pushes up.
Leopold Magnus 01:24:53 Oh yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:25:06 sort of into almost the pitch darkness of above you watching but like out of the area so it is just an open field at this point for you guys to do your thing in yes okay
Kaladen Shash 01:25:20 OK. I'm going to roll to hit with Chromatic Orb at third level. Oof. OK. That was good. It's going to hit no matter what. And then I want this to be a critical right with my Magic Almond.
Cletus Cobbington 01:25:21 Can we say we dropped our spider mode so we don't have to waste a bonus action?
Leopold Magnus 01:25:48 Nice. Oh, yeah. NDA that's great.
Dungeon Master 01:25:48 Ooh, nice. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:25:49 And we'll go fire damage. Not a bad roll. Not a great one. 27 on the first little pop there. I'll cast one Esopteric Blast to hit, maybe get a crit. Oh, almost, but no.
Cletus Cobbington 01:25:49 Digest that shit.
Kaladen Shash 01:26:19 And then so that... So the first spell was just my first round of action, right? This is second round bonus action. And then I'm going to take two attacks. And I'll roll just to see if I get a crit. Nope. But it still hits. Does it? It fails no matter what. That's so...
Dungeon Master 01:26:28 I'm with you. And that one fails. And that one auto fails.
Leopold Magnus 01:26:42 Oh, damn.
Kaladen Shash 01:26:50 That's a bummer. All right. So this will go for the usual damage. Hashtag roll. 10 plus 7. Soft on that. And then I'll do the exact same thing again.
Dungeon Master 01:27:08 Rick?
Kaladen Shash 01:27:16 All same two. So actions first, just because I'm on that page. So the first one hits. Second one, just seeing if I get a critical or not. Doesn't hit. Ah, such soft numbers. A 10 and a 1.
Leopold Magnus 01:27:24 Thanks for watching!
Kaladen Shash 01:27:43 35, not bad, not bad. And then a bonus action again for the Esoteric Blast. Come on, critical. Nope, but hits. All right, for six. Yep.
Dungeon Master 01:27:43 That is 84 damage. Some low rolls there, but strong start. Who is next?
Dungeon Master 01:28:15 Who isn't that ordering, right?
Zariel Torgan 01:28:16 Yeah, who rolled? I rolled a five.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:17 I rolled an 11, I think. Oh, wow. Okay. I guess I would be next. I just saw my dice. I was like, I definitely am not next. Okay. Cool. So Leopold kind of approaches the spider and unsheathes his searing saber and
Cletus Cobbington 01:28:18 Leopold.
Kaladen Shash 01:28:36 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:43 and goes like he's about to take a slash, but instead bends at the hip 90 degrees, and you hear this whirling, and I'm going to cast Catapult at the fourth level. Yeah, it's a dex save of 17, exactly. Yeah, and I thought for some reason that used to be to hit, but I guess not.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:57 God damn. And that's just a save, right? It automatically...
Dungeon Master 01:28:58 Nice. So it succeeds. Right.
Leopold Magnus 01:29:12 Anyway, so the spiders will take 68 damage. 28. Not bad. So that will be my first action. And we're just doing it all in one go, right? Cool.
Kaladen Shash 01:29:20 you
Cletus Cobbington 01:29:33 Who?
Dungeon Master 01:29:33 Yep. And then we'll have Paladin to be able to describe how he did his attack if you wanted to. So once you do your damage, you'll sort of explain how it happens. It can be completely different than your actual action economy. If you want some weird shit to happen, I like the good descriptions of it. Because as long as we follow the rules for the damage, it's fine.
Leopold Magnus 01:29:42 Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's cool. OK.
Zariel Torgan 01:30:02 It is.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:03 Yeah, so like I said, the searing saber is on. It shoots forward. And it looks like Leopold is about to take an attack, kind of landing in an attacking pose. And then I just hinge at the hips. And very abruptly, half of my body snaps to where I'm looking straight at the ground. And my head kind of swivels up. And he just whoosh.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:30 And all these stones start flying in from all over the ground and absorb into my chest cavity and they all launch out in this big and just blast this spider. Oh, yeah. Oh, OK, sweet.
Dungeon Master 01:30:39 Oh, shit. Real quick. Real quick. We talked about how it was going to be your stress point manifesting. You can reroll any ones or twos on all of your damage dice for your whole thing. Yeah. Kind of like the Savage Attacker thing.
Kaladen Shash 01:30:59 Jonathan. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:31:00 Ones or twos on any damage dice. Oh shit. That's brutal. That's cool. Does that kick in now or will that be after this strike?
Dungeon Master 01:31:13 Yeah, that would be the first one. So you rolled two twos. So four of that damage will be subtracted and then add whatever those two are afterwards. So 24 damage comes away. I just hover over it.
Cletus Cobbington 01:31:21 Click on the dice.
Leopold Magnus 01:31:25 Okay. For some reason, I can't see all of the dice that got rolled. How do you do that? Oh, I see. Okay. I didn't know that was a function. Cool. Two twos. I see what you're saying. So then those are d8s. Nice. So I'm going to reroll two of those. And is that like in perpetuity or is it just once? Seems like it would be.
Kaladen Shash 01:31:35 It.
Dungeon Master 01:31:51 for your turn you'll get that the whole time so Leopold's demonstration will be basically like max damage no sorry one time each time turns to 29 damage instead
Leopold Magnus 01:32:01 Right. Well, I mean, like what I'm saying is like, do I now reroll that one? Okay. I see. Yeah. I was going to say that would be insane if you just kept rolling. Okay. But that's, yes, that's one. Yeah. That's funny. One extra damage, but that's chill. Okay. So that was my attack action.
Cletus Cobbington 01:32:09 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:32:18 Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:32:20 Okay, then continue.
Leopold Magnus 01:32:26 And then I'll kind of snap back into place, standing upright and kneel down and I'll say, bone crusher, fuck that guy up. And bone crusher just kind of ominously steps out of my back armor. You see the bone crusher written on the back shoulder blades, cape and toe. And he runs up to attack because I will tell him to attack on my bonus action.
Leopold Magnus 01:32:54 for that one so then my second turn okay I see so even though I summon him he won't go until okay
Dungeon Master 01:32:55 Okay, I'm going to have him mechanically go on your second turn just so it would work out. So like this is action economy one. Bone Crusher is going to act on action economy two because you have to summon him. If that makes sense. Yeah, because there's not like initiative order. He doesn't pop up after you, but he'll go the next time you go.
Leopold Magnus 01:33:23 Yeah, all right. Oh, cool. Okay, so that was my attack and bonus action. And then for my next attack, I will do two slashes with the Searing Saber. And I think you said it was at AC 10. Okay, I can't miss it. I can get a crit. It doesn't look like it. Okay, sweet. So that's two slashes.
Dungeon Master 01:33:39 it's only on that one yeah
Leopold Magnus 01:33:52 I mean, can we say for the challenge, I could have dropped my shield? Okay. So I'll have dropped my shield, and I will instead roll two-handed. So that'll be 2d10. 7. Oh, sweet. That's funny. So 23 on that, and then 2d6. 3.
Leopold Magnus 01:34:22 Five. Nice. So eight damage there in addition to that 26. And then for that bonus action, I will call forth the magic stones. And then Bone Crusher will attack. He has... Let me see. Gosh, I can never find his stats.
Cletus Cobbington 01:34:31 And.
Dungeon Master 01:34:31 Bye. Yes, he will. Yep.
Leopold Magnus 01:34:50 He has a plus 9 to hit, so actually he can't miss because natural ones always miss. Nice. 26 to hit, and he will do 1d8 plus 4 on that.
Leopold Magnus 01:35:03 Nice, seven damage on the roll and then plus four. So yeah, 11 total from the bone crusher slice. So yeah, you see him emerge from my armor. He just kind of sets his eyes directly on a carapace and he just slashes the spider in half and the four legs go skittering one direction and four go skittering the other. It's not dead yet, but it will be soon.
Dungeon Master 01:35:13 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 01:35:30 And then that was to attack or to action so I will do a third action I will take just another two swings with the searing saber Yes, and yeah, I use my bonus action to call it magic stones on that I
Cletus Cobbington 01:35:34 Um,
Dungeon Master 01:35:44 Go for it. And this is third round at this point. Perfect. Perfect. So this will be the culmination of your power. Love it.
Leopold Magnus 01:35:57 Yep, exactly. So two searing strikes. Nice. Oh, ignore that. But I'm going to roll this. Yeah, I can't click plus two, but I'll just roll them individually. 13. Solid. Oh, 16 damage. Magma goes flying everywhere from the searing saber. Then a 2d6.
Dungeon Master 01:36:18 My 29. 39. 30. Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 01:36:30 Oh, nice. Max damage on one slice. And then, nice. That was 30 on that one attack, one action. Nice. All right, then I will do Magic Stone. Again, can't miss because if I roll on that one, it misses anyways. So that will do 1d6 plus 5. Oh, but I get to re-roll that one.
Dungeon Master 01:36:58 Yes, you do. Nice. And then .
Leopold Magnus 01:36:59 Right? Nice. So D6. Oh, big swing. So then that becomes 10 damage on the magic stone.
Leopold Magnus 01:37:14 So as I'm slicing, yeah, Leopold's just not even paying attention. One of the stones flying above him just sinks up and launches straight at something. Makes a good connection. And then I have Bone Crusher's action. And I think that would be the last thing I can do. Dun, dun, dun.
Cletus Cobbington 01:37:38 The last thing dawn. She's.
Leopold Magnus 01:37:41 Oh, but he misses. Damn it. Oh, yeah, he rolls in that one. Oh, shit. That was pretty good.
Dungeon Master 01:37:42 Hell of a turn so far. But he misses. Leopold, you did 123 damage. We'll jump back for a second. Kaladin, how did you finish off all the spiders as they're all coming at you?
Zariel Torgan 01:37:54 Am. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:38:07 I think I would have started with the biggest attack, just like it sounded like. And it would have been a fire chromatic orb. So like right through a bunch of them, but counted for one. And then same thing as they approached, use the blast to clear some space, swing at them twice, cutting legs down, do it again, blast, clear some space, two more slashes.
Dungeon Master 01:38:30 beautiful all righty and then uh leopold describe how uh if you want to change it how does leopold kill them as it appears to everybody else
Leopold Magnus 01:38:31 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 01:38:48 Yeah, I mean, you would have seen all of those things kind of happen as they were occurring. But one thing you'll notice is it's almost like a battlefield commander. Leopold is screaming out directions to bone crusher while taking slices. And they're kind of working in perfect tandem together. So it's a well-intricated or like choreographed dance. You can kind of tell that we're in sync. Yeah. Only thing to add.
Dungeon Master 01:39:13 Okay. Awesome. As that ends, Leopold panting as an automaton armored suit. He didn't notice it as much. He was just going into the zone. But as he stepped out into the space where he could kill the spiders, as they're swarming into him, you guys saw that he started emitting this red light
Cletus Cobbington 01:39:24 Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:39:40 black smoke that just looked almost like he had a furnace igniting in his core as he sort of gave off this aura and his armor almost took on the appearance of like having spider legs if you like equate it to in the spider-man movies his suit has like the little appendages that protect him like you grow these like
Kaladen Shash 01:39:43 you
Dungeon Master 01:40:01 mechanical arms and as you're cutting and slicing them down the arms are swinging and like also embedding and killing them you see like leopold is throwing things and like basically this spinning ball of blades as he's cutting through all of these spiders uh and we'll we will address how your curse manifests uh i'll add it to my running notes of what each one was for
Leopold Magnus 01:40:27 Cool.
Dungeon Master 01:40:27 insane display mechanically brand new killed seven fighters seven and some change Leopold just killed 11 who's up next
Cletus Cobbington 01:40:44 Believe it's me. All right. Well, hard following up that. We're just going to rely on some really good damage rolls here. That's the only way. Because I cannot really buff, but I also only get one little thing per turn. OK.
Dungeon Master 01:40:56 Does Cletus get angry?
Kaladen Shash 01:41:01 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:01 Ha ha.
Leopold Magnus 01:41:02 Good evening.
Cletus Cobbington 01:41:13 Well, I just kind of looked dumbfounded as I just saw my robotic friend just go absolutely apeshit on these spiders. And I'm going to just saunter up to the first bunch and boop it on its noggin and cast Inflict Wounds at the fourth level. And that just hits, right, with the con save?
Leopold Magnus 01:41:34 Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:41:38 34 nice well I will say I just thought of it and it might be my own downfall but
Cletus Cobbington 01:41:40 OK, so that's 5d10. Roll good, please. 34 damage. So all I can really do is just three spells. I don't have any bonus actions that do anything.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:49 Pretty good. It's pretty good.
Dungeon Master 01:42:04 Leopold I allowed to summon his Bone Crusher to act as a separate entity adding damage. There's a certain spell you guys possess where you bring in entities to attack. Maybe consider that if you don't want to just do the same thing three times in a row. Because I'm not going to tell you how many you need to kill, but you need
Cletus Cobbington 01:42:11 Yeah. Right. And that would mean I cast that. Right. All right.
Kaladen Shash 01:42:16 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:42:35 You need to kill more than you've currently killed Oh shit
Cletus Cobbington 01:42:42 Let's see. All right. I'll cast one more damage spell, then we'll try that. Just because. All right. And I'll touch some more, and then I'll cast Inflict Wounds at the fifth level. Get another decent there. Whoa! Oh my god, I rolled terrible.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:05 Ain't fucking around. Oh, Jesus. Now.
Leopold Magnus 01:43:10 And...
Kaladen Shash 01:43:11 It happens. It's okay. It's okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:43:13 OK, well, that's all right. All right, so let's see. This is the hard part of finding. I think the higher challenge rating will technically do more damage.
Cletus Cobbington 01:43:41 I'd have to look. I did not spend time looking these creatures up to see what would do damage, because I figured my spells would probably just do more anyway. Yeah, I'm just going to cast a different spell then. Just think I have higher odds. OK. Yeah, I would do Moonbeam, because that's cooler. But we're just going to do Inflict Moons again, because it does more damage.
Dungeon Master 01:43:50 You don't have to do it. Ooh. Okay. You can describe it like it's Moonbeam, though.
Cletus Cobbington 01:44:14 Yeah, ooh, kind of like how all the mushrooms have embedded in the web as their own network. I mean, the spiders are so close. They're kind of their own. So I touch one, and as the damage spreads throughout, it kind of keeps going through all of them, connecting from one to the other. So one more time. 39 down.
Dungeon Master 01:44:22 Oh.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:36 Come on, big money. Nice. There you go. At 96 total.
Kaladen Shash 01:44:40 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:40 Nice.
Cletus Cobbington 01:44:44 OK. I wish my fifth level did that, but we'll take it, I suppose. All right.
Dungeon Master 01:44:52 That is 96 total, which means that you mechanically killed 8.7, so about nine. At least one has to be strong enough.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:10 So, John, you said it was a cumulative, or it's just like one of us has to pass the challenge. Otherwise, we're done. Oh, damn. Back him up, Zario.
Cletus Cobbington 01:45:23 Let's see, what was it? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:45:25 Up next is Cyrus. Zario goes before, actually. It goes Cyrus, then Zario with a 9 and then the 5. But I'm looking at Travis at his stats again, and I think I complained about this before, but he's got no damage spells, so he can only attack.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:30 All right. Is it? Oh. Yeah. You could buff me if he wants, although it's not going to help with whatever I'm going to do. I guess it might. I don't know.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:46 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:46:01 We'll see, we'll see. Hold on, hold on. He's going to... We'll just say defensive flourish each time. And so he'll add his... I think he gets a d8 to each of his rolls, too. But he'll just, real straightforward, take two attacks...
Dungeon Master 01:46:27 Each time. And then roll for damage on those. First one. Oh. Oh. Oh. That hits.
Dungeon Master 01:47:05 It's really slow to do it this way. Hold on, let me just do something else instead. Give me a moment. Okay, he hit, but the damage didn't go through. That is
Zariel Torgan 01:47:21 See you.
Dungeon Master 01:47:34 5, 13, I mean, plus 5, so that's 18 on the first. Hits. 14 more damage, plus 2, that's 16.
Dungeon Master 01:48:04 And then he gets an extra D8 on each of those. Far more. His second turn. Almost missed, but didn't. And then that's
Cletus Cobbington 01:48:28 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:48:36 12 and 4. So that's 16 more. He can do one more flourish. That's six more. And then the last round. First one is a hit. Second one is a
Dungeon Master 01:49:06 No crits, though. That's crazy. That's two hits of this. 30 damage total on all those. Anybody have that up right away? I can just plug it in real quick.
Cletus Cobbington 01:49:39 Did not. 4052. Oh.
Leopold Magnus 01:49:39 What are you looking for? Oh, sorry. Not bad.
Dungeon Master 01:49:42 I didn't know if anybody was tracking that. I was. That was 91 damage total. Which means he killed 8. Yeah, 8.27.
Kaladen Shash 01:49:42 I thought you were writing it down. We can get it pretty quick here.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:48 Yeah, I was in my head for a second, but then I saw you writing it, so I stopped. Pretty good. 8.4.
Dungeon Master 01:50:13 say 3, so basically just 8, because it's closer to 8 than it is to 9. After that is Zario. Mm-hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 01:50:18 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:50:22 All right, so I'm going to transform into a T-Rex. And I would like to roll all my attacks together and all my damage at once. And then afterwards, it'll make sense why. So that's going to be plus 10. But since we're just doing it otherwise, I'll just roll it all together. Hopefully I don't get any ones.
Dungeon Master 01:50:47 Sam. Sam.
Zariel Torgan 01:50:50 No 1s, but also no crits. So all straight rolls. And then that's going to be 4d12 plus 7 for the bite and 3d8 plus 7 for the tail. So I'll roll 12d12 plus 21 first. So this plus 21.
Leopold Magnus 01:51:10 that's fucking incredible uh
Kaladen Shash 01:51:11 Just roll well. He should get to like 150 easy. Great opener, 103. 21.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:21 That plus 21, so that's 102. And then for the byte, it's 3d8 plus 7, so that'll be 98 plus 21. So I'll do that real quick. 98. And so this plus 21. So 102 plus 33, which is 134, plus 21 is 155.
Dungeon Master 01:51:24 102.
Cletus Cobbington 01:51:31 you
Leopold Magnus 01:51:49 That's great.
Kaladen Shash 01:51:50 There you go. It's 150. Like alligator death rolling right there, just.
Dungeon Master 01:51:53 155. What is that? Now, Jesse,
Zariel Torgan 01:51:56 And the way I'd like this to work is I'm going to transform, but then I'm just going to see them all laid out in front of me. And rather than trying to bite and hit each one, I'm just going to roll over and just roll sideways and try to crush as many of them as I can. Roll. Like a steamroller. Yeah, yeah. Just surface area. I do.
Cletus Cobbington 01:52:13 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:52:26 The advanced goal was that if you killed 15 of the fighters, you would get to challenge her. You were at 14.09. Does Zariel want to push himself a little bit harder?
Kaladen Shash 01:52:36 Yeah. Missed the bar.
Zariel Torgan 01:52:45 Absolutely. I push myself when I'm just going to the bathroom. I'll do it now. Oh, shit.
Leopold Magnus 01:52:54 that's great oh shit
Dungeon Master 01:53:01 You gain the same thing that Leopold gained for the round. You can reroll any of your ones and twos. So on your most recent roll, you had one, two, three, four d8s to reroll.
Cletus Cobbington 01:53:02 I'll do it right now.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:23 All right, so let's just do some, I need a pen or something. I'm not going to be able to track it otherwise. I don't have a pen. Do you want to do my grunt work for me, Jonathan? So can you take six off of 33, and then I'll reroll this. So 27 plus 12.
Kaladen Shash 01:53:36 49. 39, right? Yep.
Dungeon Master 01:53:39 Yeah, I got you. I'll just take the difference of both. Be easier to add that to the total. I'm just six. You were down six.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:53 is my brain is just not working. Thank you. So it's an extra six. Yeah, it's an extra six on top of that. Gotcha. I see what you're saying. I see what you're saying. So yeah. And then I have another one, two, three, four on the other previous one.
Dungeon Master 01:54:06 That's easier for my brain is just dictate is to take the gross. I mean, the net. Yeah, so on the D 12s, you have 123.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:26 Oh, yeah, sorry. I was looking at the wrong thing. 1, 2, 3. So 3d12. So that's five different. So we'll just look at the difference. So five of these. Sorry, I keep messing that up. I apologize. It's only one, two, three of them, not four of them. OK. And so that's a difference of 19. Yeah, that's a big difference.
Cletus Cobbington 01:54:40 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:54:40 You're good. Damn. So that's a plus 14. Your plus 20 total.
Kaladen Shash 01:54:53 Great. Well, that was it. Push you over the bar. Got to keep it tight.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:58 Yeah, so plus 14 plus 6, that's 20. I tuck my little arms in so I don't hurt them because they're small. You know, they're not big and made for...
Leopold Magnus 01:55:02 That's super great. Yeah. You did a lot more damage.
Cletus Cobbington 01:55:15 I got big arms. No robbing the boy.
Dungeon Master 01:55:16 Okay. Let's take the total now. So that's 165 total damage. Divided by 11. Is it? Yeah. You're right. What am I saying? I'm trying to rob you is what I'm trying to do.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:27 Could be 175, right? Because it was a 20-point swing. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:55:43 15.9 which is 16 um now dinosaur zariel as you're rolling around you guys see he like gets bigger and bigger every time he turns slightly and it is like this monstrous dinosaur reptile just sort of like godzilla like crushing all of the spiders they don't all die it's like the spider's twitching but he kills enough of them with his mask
Dungeon Master 01:56:11 that all of them sort of back off enough time passes that you, um, can like come out of your forms or keep in them if you want. Um, cause the next thing that happens is you see this, well, it would drop the spider comes back down and then making contact with all of you, your magic stops functioning for the time and you hear in your head, well done.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:15 Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:56:42 you will be excellent feast looking at the giant reptile. But before that you see one of the arms reaches up and like claws, even like the whole webbing portion of that area with all the potions, one for each of you gets pulled off the wall and landing in front of you are these glowing, very magical looking potions.
Leopold Magnus 01:57:10 Take a look now. Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:57:11 The spider sort of sets back, sort of like gets comfortable in the web kind of position. And in your head you go, I have nothing but time. Inspect with you will. I mean to heal you.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:11 Yeah, I'll snag one up. Yeah, nothing but time. I'm going to run back to the other dome. I'll come back when I feel better. Thanks.
Cletus Cobbington 01:57:12 let's take a long rest let's keep these fucking potions it's nothing like we are
Kaladen Shash 01:57:29 Insightful.
Leopold Magnus 01:57:39 I'm into that. I think I'm just going to uncork mine and drink it.
Dungeon Master 01:57:40 You get the sense that that's probably not going to be OK. TinyDome goes up. Look.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:44 Yeah. I can't tell what these do, but I'll pick one up and I'll I'll do my best to look at it, I guess.
Cletus Cobbington 01:57:46 I plunge my... I just make a tree. Alright, well... I mean, she's been pretty young on this. I think it just...
Dungeon Master 01:58:07 like a very powerful version of like a healing potion. Like it's very restorative in magic.
Leopold Magnus 01:58:14 Actually, you know what? I'm going to keep it right now. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I only used one spell as well. Yeah. I'm going to save that sucker. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:58:17 I was going to say, that seems like a thing to save because I only used one spell. Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:58:28 I'm going to pocket one because I only had used a third level spell once. Everything else was a bonus action or attacks. Is it just a red? What is the potion? I can...
Cletus Cobbington 01:58:40 I might.
Dungeon Master 01:58:44 I'm not gonna tell you now. You don't think you have that much time. It was like drink this to regain your strength, and then we'll fight. But this is also you guys realize your chance to be like now we're good.
Zariel Torgan 01:58:47 You don't get it. Do we get the feeling we could take a short rest and inspect these and get an idea, or is it not that kind of break? Okay. Oh.
Leopold Magnus 01:58:48 oh so it's either you drink them and you fight you can't just like pocket them and also fight nice
Kaladen Shash 01:59:15 No. I mean, I feel like that's
Dungeon Master 01:59:16 Drink it and fight. Leave it and go. Try to steal them. Probably end up in a fight anyway. You say you chug it? Cletus, you...
Leopold Magnus 01:59:21 Got it.
Cletus Cobbington 01:59:22 I'm chugging it. I'm chugging it. I use a lot of my spells, or all my high level pretty much.
Zariel Torgan 01:59:28 Fuck yeah. Oh shit!
Dungeon Master 01:59:34 You feel this warmth in your core, and it almost like it spreads out like leaves sort of blowing in the wind. Your whole body feels completely restored. You gain the benefits of a long rest, and Cletus levels up. Nobody else knows that, but Cletus knows. Oh, I'm sorry. Can you hear me?
Leopold Magnus 01:59:52 Nice. Jonathan, we were really annoyed when we were just going to put those in our inventory.
Kaladen Shash 01:59:53 Crack that cork open.
Cletus Cobbington 01:59:54 Holy fuck, does it taste like almonds? Holy fuck. Yeah. That's so funny. I look just a little stronger, a little more put together, and everyone's just saving it for later.
Zariel Torgan 02:00:00 Now I feel bad. He's just like, yeah, save those till level 20. Sure, yeah, that's going to be super helpful.
Dungeon Master 02:00:04 fucking biceps now. It's crazy. You notice Cletus looks great.
Cletus Cobbington 02:00:26 Guys, guys, I don't – not worth saving. I feel so wonderful right now.
Zariel Torgan 02:00:27 What do you say, Jonathan? Would it be too much metagaming for us to drink it now? I really do want a little. I have a feeling we're going to need it against this thing. All right. Easy.
Kaladen Shash 02:00:36 Yeah, I'm going to chug that thing. I'm very excited.
Dungeon Master 02:00:36 His hair kind of like blows in the wind, even though there's no wind. Everybody who drinks from the potion gains the benefits of a long rest and levels up.
Leopold Magnus 02:01:00 Yeah, I'll take a level up there.
Zariel Torgan 02:01:01 um,
Dungeon Master 02:01:03 And as you guys are leveling up and we'll close the session just a little early, actually, just we'll give it, we'll roll initiative and we'll end there. But as you guys drink them, you hear in your head, good. And then out loud in a growl, you hear just because I was so hungry. And the form starts like cracking and compressing. And you see,
Kaladen Shash 02:01:30 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:01:34 out of the center of the abdomen, where all the arms spread out. It cracks and peels, and this bath of green light explodes down, and you see this horrid creature, smaller in size, but definitely more formidable.
Cletus Cobbington 02:01:58 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:01:58 Oh damn.
Dungeon Master 02:01:59 of this grotesque form, like connected, but not like almost centipede-ish, but still very spider in its like anatomy. And different to this picture, this is just the stock one. This creature, as you notice, also has one large eye and then little ones sort of scattered around it in a ring.
Zariel Torgan 02:01:59 Ooh.
Dungeon Master 02:02:27 And it wields this nasty sword as it pulls it out of Icar. And everybody can roll initiative once you finish leveling up. Damn.
Leopold Magnus 02:02:41 damn that's a real bummer
Zariel Torgan 02:02:44 I rolled a two on my hit point. Very, very sad.
Cletus Cobbington 02:02:48 Where did my thing go? I only see the map. I am going to level up at a later date, because I need to figure out what class I want to level up.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:52 What is this? John? It's 1D6 for Wizard, right? It does? Okay. Let's get that rolled real quick. I'll give it to you. My sheet's all blank. This is so strange.
Dungeon Master 02:03:06 No worries. Yes. Yes
Dungeon Master 02:03:34 Did you get on that D6? Did Leah pull the roller? Are you figuring it out too? Yeah. Nice.
Kaladen Shash 02:03:38 I'm reloading the page. It's like being all weird. It's like blank. I got a four.
Leopold Magnus 02:03:51 Right now, I was just picking some infusions. I'll probably just pick one really quick and then circle back. But yeah, I did roll it. So I took a level of artificer. So the hit die is a D8. OK.
Dungeon Master 02:04:07 Yes.
Kaladen Shash 02:04:12 All right.
Leopold Magnus 02:04:21 Okay, so let me roll that then.
Dungeon Master 02:04:26 Okay, so everybody leveled up. You can change things if you did it in a rush to the roll hit points, but Lucletus, as it is, is the only one, and Cyrus didn't pick their thing yet, so we'll do that to start next time. That'll just be my bookkeeping. That's what I wrote down. Yeah. I'm excited.
Cletus Cobbington 02:04:30 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:04:44 It should be fun. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:04:52 It's going to be a big, it'll be an encounter for sure.
Leopold Magnus 02:04:56 Yeah, I think that would probably be pretty tough. But I'm guessing we'll be ready for it. We did a lot of damage there, and that was a lower level. Five.
Cletus Cobbington 02:05:06 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:05:09 Yeah. Leopold and Zariel. Way to go. Now, what I thought was going to happen, and that's what I said I thought I shot myself, essentially, is that I thought you were going to cast Conjure Woodland Creatures or whatever, where you get eight wolves. And I was like, shit. They all get their attack, and they can do it round one, so it acts on round two and three. And I was like, oh, my God. What did I do?
Leopold Magnus 02:05:30 Yeah, and they all get free hit.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:30 I thought about it, but I know you hate those wolves so, so very much. And so I was like, I'll stay away. Yeah. Well, I just got to be a T-Rex with abs. I didn't mention it on the top, but he's got like washboard abs.
Dungeon Master 02:05:47 Now this is a chance to just high damage. Figure out combos for your character. Now we're going to see that in the Discord later, a T-Rex with abs. Hold on. I got to go to the thing. Perfect.
Cletus Cobbington 02:05:50 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:06:02 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:06:03 Nice. I was going to say, I rolled a 5 on my d8, so now I have 87 hit points, which is pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. What do you get with fighter? Is it like 2? A d10.
Kaladen Shash 02:06:17 Now you're getting up there, man. That fighter section of my cross is giving me so many points. I'm so used to having just that 1d6 for wizard. It's hilarious. 10, a d10. Yeah. Just that little battle.
Zariel Torgan 02:06:33 Oh, shit. Yeah. That's a great one.
Leopold Magnus 02:06:34 Nice. Okay. So Jonathan, this curse thing, so I can always reroll ones and twos or was it just for that round? Got it. Got it. Okay. So later at some point, the curse will be revealed as to what it looks like. Got it. What do you do with that one?
Dungeon Master 02:06:41 No, that is for that. Yes. Mm hmm.
Kaladen Shash 02:06:50 Yeah, Jonathan, you need to be better about that. That's one of my feats is that great weapon fighter. Yeah. It's just melee, though. Exactly what you did, but just with melee attacks only. I just am never a fighter. I just got to remember to do that.
Zariel Torgan 02:07:03 Gotcha. Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 02:07:05 Oh, okay. Yeah. The rerolls ones and twos. That's, that's crazy. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. But that was, that was a lot of fun.
Cletus Cobbington 02:07:07 Random thing for you, Joanie boy. I'm listening to episode 100 of Campaign 1 right now. And in the first three minutes,
Dungeon Master 02:07:16 It's also a barbarian thing. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:07:37 they make a joke that,

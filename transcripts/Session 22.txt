Dungeon Master 00:00:02 break. No.
Zariel Torgan 00:00:03 Oh, yeah. Do I have to lead it in in any special way to make sure that it gets captured, or will it just automatically capture it? All right. Yeah. So the night before, while everybody else was dreaming, as I was drifting off to sleep, I received a sending spell from the Lord Marshal.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:04 Let's go. No, yeah, it'll just, it'll get it, yeah. At least as long as it's clear, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:00:05 You agree?
Zariel Torgan 00:00:32 He then relayed to me that I was responsible for killing his mate, the large werewolf, along with his kin, and that now he was seizing control of the city, and we had a bit of a dialogue, and that was about it. Is that good enough, or did I miss anything?
Cletus Cobbington 00:00:51 Add 1 teaspoon of honey
Leopold Magnus 00:00:54 Yeah, that sounds all great. I guess. Okay. So I'm trying to work out the timeline of when we left and when all that happened. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:01:03 Okay, and then I'll get into that. You guys, after you had your little like werewolf den fight, bolted straight out, and then you left straight from the tavern to your bunks, and then you took a couple days of downtime, and then left early in the morning after talking to Captain Levi. So, it was like four days.
Kaladen Shash 00:01:11 That's only chilled.
Zariel Torgan 00:01:22 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:01:31 What had you missed was in the tavern where all those like different activities and games. But one of the things there was that the Lord Marshal was at the bar waiting and he missed you on your guys's way out because I rolled in front of the table and it was just like was nothing. I was like, oh, nothing happens. But. Well, he was. He had gone to the bar.
Kaladen Shash 00:01:52 Wow.
Leopold Magnus 00:01:53 he's just at the bar getting a drink because you know he killed his wife and he's like
Dungeon Master 00:02:01 like probably rushed there but by the time he had arrived he did they all have a connection like where else do you share that innate sense um he could tell that he was too late so then he was waiting he did have a connection then with um zariel so he had kind of sensed what had happened and then you guys bolted he went down there
Cletus Cobbington 00:02:14 Bye!
Dungeon Master 00:02:27 had a little freak out and then you guys left and there was another person you were supposed to talk to also that you also missed. So there's something else that didn't happen. But like now you're getting sort of caught up because Pleiades and Cyrus, um, experience would happen when all like the werewolves sacked the city. So like the defenses are still holding. Yeah. The, the defenses are still holding. It's not happening, but it's basically like,
Leopold Magnus 00:02:49 Oh, OK. I didn't piece that together. OK. Right.
Dungeon Master 00:02:57 civil war happening inside the city. There's not safe areas, war zones, fight scenes, like all that kind of stuff. And so they were sent out after like that had already occurred. So it's now been pieced together that the Lord Marshal, in like a fit of rage, decided to attack the city. But you don't have other details about
Leopold Magnus 00:03:20 OK. Got it, uhm?
Dungeon Master 00:03:23 what's the story why is he a werewolf who did you actually kill the exact wording used was you killed her and i think the assumption and like logical arrival is mate or so but not totally confirmed and then um then you guys had your fight against the astral stone chimera uh grueling battle pretty fun um
Dungeon Master 00:03:52 It had like an amorphous head that would change into the shape of the animal that it was using the attack of.
Dungeon Master 00:03:58 to gain different abilities, because when it turned into a creature, it only had one head. You got the Psionic Aegis, which is a very powerful artifact that can help you in your fight against the Illithids. And we ended it right there with you guys leveling up. So, as we pick up, you guys know... Oh, also, of context, this was... Not...
Dungeon Master 00:04:27 totally confirmed or clear what happened, but there were some rolls that happened during the shifts as they were sort of taking a long rest. That was like nat ones and you haven't learned consequences and it happened like two separate times. So that's the only other piece of context.
Dungeon Master 00:04:44 You guys know there's the Mind Flayer colony in the other ruins, and you guys pick up. You haven't even rested yet. I called this one more of like the video game mechanics, where you just sort of leveled up in spot. So you guys are still pretty tired. You sort of felt a surge of power, but you guys are free to do whatever you'd like.
Zariel Torgan 00:04:49 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 00:04:56 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:05:11 Oh yeah, and then just for clarity, the reason why Lord Marshall and Zariel have a connection is because Zariel's cursed with a werewolf. Okay. Got it.
Dungeon Master 00:05:18 Zoro's curse, and also it wasn't so much a connection as the Lord Marshal used three sending scrolls to have like a short conversation. And then after he supposedly, you would think, ran out or whatever ran out, he didn't have a means to continue the conversation.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:43 Can I just add that I'm actually very excited that you guys didn't finish the Ilithid dungeon. Just because I mean, I know it's selfish, but I was like, I'm really bummed I'm going to miss that. And I'm glad that we still have it. Oh, yeah, we're going to be like Ilithid who? Get your tentacles off me.
Kaladen Shash 00:05:52 Oh man, you're still, still there.
Leopold Magnus 00:06:00 Yeah, no, no way. Now we have the upgrade to we're going to walk in and kick their ass. Jonathan, could I take a look at that? I don't know if there's a check I could make to maybe attenuate its power, like is there a way I could make it maybe slightly better so that maybe because I know it has a certain ability that prevents the mind flayers from directly. Talking to the where, right?
Dungeon Master 00:06:30 Mhm. I will say, um, just from it's like construction, you can tell this is really high level magic. You couldn't in any amount of short time accomplish that. But like if you had a long time, you know, maybe even like a hundred hours you could enchant additional stuff into this. But anytime a powerful enchantment goes on an item, it basically gets harder to enchant going forward.
Leopold Magnus 00:06:31 And then there is a AOE. I don't know if that's possible or not. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:06:58 And when you hit to like the status of artifact, it's like, you pretty much can't mess with that stuff. It is possible, but really hard. Talking to a bunch.
Leopold Magnus 00:07:06 Okay. And I'll file that away for later. Yeah, I was going to say, what do you, what do you guys want to do? Like we're, uh, we're in this chamber, right? You just go back and kick the illicit ass or.
Cletus Cobbington 00:07:25 Ni hao.
Kaladen Shash 00:07:27 I thought we made it all the way back out. I thought at the end of the last episode we made it back up between the two doors. This is where we happen to be.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:31 I mean, yeah, I mean, are we, well,
Leopold Magnus 00:07:40 Oh, we did. I guess. Yeah, we all got long rests.
Dungeon Master 00:07:42 Okay. And you still have whatever you'd like to do.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:55 So I could go because I was used sparingly while I wasn't here. Oh, I thought it was just... Oh, okay. So should I take a long rest then? I should... Oh, gotcha. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:08:02 I mean, everybody, right, but we video, we all video game leveled up anyway, so everybody should be fresh.
Dungeon Master 00:08:16 Yeah, you gain the benefits of the long rest. Just like if you were to look at your physical forms, you would be, you know, winded kind of deal. In game, you are, you just had a fight, but you leveled up.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:26 Gotcha. Sweet. Okay, cool. Yeah, that makes sense. Did you guys get anything cool for level eight? Oh, nice. Oh, that's cool. What about Cletus?
Cletus Cobbington 00:08:35 I got a Mega Action Sniper Rifle from Johnny Boy. No.
Leopold Magnus 00:08:39 I've got second level spells now because I went into wizard, so at least I can do that, which is cool. Basically blows people's heads off.
Kaladen Shash 00:08:39 I took my fifth fighter level, so now I have two melee attacks.
Dungeon Master 00:09:00 It's pretty much the strongest thing
Zariel Torgan 00:09:01 Oh, interesting. It's a really bold move.
Cletus Cobbington 00:09:07 No, but I did take... I did take a firearm feat. So maybe later we can, uh... find me a gun. You make guns? Oh shit!
Kaladen Shash 00:09:10 you.
Leopold Magnus 00:09:22 No, well, Cletus, I might be able to make something up. Well, I made this. And a little slingshot auto-cannon pops out of my arm. Now, I might be able to figure out something for you. I wouldn't... Yeah, ball thrower. I would be careful with that if I were you, to be honest.
Dungeon Master 00:09:35 It's like a bull thrower. You hear Chip go, what the fuck?
Cletus Cobbington 00:09:37 I set Chip into the sling. Zariel! Zariel, go long! Oh, fuck! I disappeared for a long time tracking him down.
Kaladen Shash 00:09:41 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:09:49 I'll take off running.
Leopold Magnus 00:09:50 But as you're fiddling around my arm, I accidentally activate it. Chip goes flying. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
Cletus Cobbington 00:10:06 Face peeling back as he whips through the air. They're so flappy. He always has acorns in there so they're extra flappy. All right, well, I might take you up on that offer maybe after we're done in this dungeon here. All right, sounds good.
Dungeon Master 00:10:08 His cheeks are so inflated from air that he's picking up as he's going.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:26 Well, that sounds excellent. I can draft you up some blueprints, give you some options to look at. Yes.
Cletus Cobbington 00:10:37 Uh, well, I don't know who this, uh, scary dude is, but, uh, I guess that's our next in line? Right? Mind Flayer dude? Or what have you?
Kaladen Shash 00:10:51 Yes, yes, we will go back into the hiding. Wesley, poor Wesley. Bradycats, Wesley. Right, is Tucker still Tucker? Are they around?
Leopold Magnus 00:10:57 But we can't leave poor Tucker and Wesley behind. There's the repetitive bird or whatever his name was. Wasn't it Tucker? Yeah, okay. And Wesley was the rabbit, that's right.
Dungeon Master 00:11:10 That's Tucker. Tucker was the Kenku. And Wesley is the Hunter. And you guys don't know, you know? Yeah, I think we really had left it at the bottom, because you were going to see something if you made it to the top.
Kaladen Shash 00:11:23 because they've run off or we're not outside yet. Is that what we're saying? Okay, cool, cool, cool. Yeah, do we need to navigate back out or can we just slowly make it back out? Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:11:41 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:11:45 No, I'm going to say just speed it up. Take a levity. You guys move forward back through the trial chambers. Again, anything really only spawned in as you guys were starting it. So now that it's been opened, you guys can make it through pretty quickly. And when you make it back to the surface, everybody go ahead and give me a perception check.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:22 Hey, not bad. And I have a plus here, I rolled a nine. Ah, nice.
Dungeon Master 00:12:23 You got plus seven and you rolled a 13, Trace? Oh, Cyrus will do it too. Your thing instantly said plus seven. I was like, oh hell yeah, it's going to be high.
Cletus Cobbington 00:12:26 I don't appreciate being role-shamed right off the bat, okay?
Kaladen Shash 00:12:31 I did terrible. Got a nine.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:37 All right, 24.
Dungeon Master 00:12:53 And then the result was 13. A solid number. The only one who doesn't pick up on it, all of the roles are high enough that.
Cletus Cobbington 00:12:56 Hey, it's a good number, okay?
Dungeon Master 00:13:08 You see that it's bright daylight. The first thing you notice is you open the big stone doors, and then, like, with the grinding movement, they sort of open. You get hit with the rays of light that are so intense, you go blind for a second. Your vision adjusts, and you see, first of all, there is no trace of Wesley or Tucker. Empty space. The second thing you see is on the ground,
Zariel Torgan 00:13:22 Please.
Kaladen Shash 00:13:28 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:13:34 um in like the center of the space between the two uh dungeons we'll just call it to be frank um there is like shreds of clothing of like a simple robe um and like black feathers sort of piled up on the ground um not in any neat patterning but almost like they've exploded out um and that is all you see there is no um no sound even at this moment
Zariel Torgan 00:14:03 Can I check for tracks maybe? Like if they were hanging out, like walking around waiting for us, can I look and see if there's any other footprints or something? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:14:03 Just pretty silent, still air. But that is what you see.
Cletus Cobbington 00:14:10 For as the artist can see.
Kaladen Shash 00:14:23 Do they, yeah, do they go towards the door or towards the woods? I was gonna say, who cares?
Zariel Torgan 00:14:30 Or if there's like more like a group came out and got them or something or drag barks or anything like that.
Dungeon Master 00:14:35 Mm-hmm. Yeah. Go ahead and give me a survival. Yeah, you're already doing it. 27, great roll. High enough to see things that most people would miss. Azariel, as you are sort of looking on our ground, you know...
Cletus Cobbington 00:14:54 Hehe.
Dungeon Master 00:14:55 You see what are very obviously like Wesley's hair footed footprints, sort of externally rotated, you see them they're pretty long distance in between each one, all hitting almost in a beeline for the trees cover like into the forest line before they suddenly stop.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:03 Wait. Silence.
Dungeon Master 00:15:17 You don't see any other footsteps, whether or not you miss them or they're just not there. You don't, you can't know for definite certainty, but there's just a complete absence of footsteps. And you do notice with the 27 that the door to the illithid colony is cracked, not completely closed, almost like it was closed in a rush.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:32 Yeah, you know, we should work on your tracking a little more.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:41 I'm going to walk to the opposite direction of that and, you know, imagine a clearing there and bend down, inspect the area, turn to Zariel and say, I'm pretty sure they camped right over here. Oh.
Kaladen Shash 00:15:51 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:15:59 Thyrus looks at you and he just goes, what the fuck? Oh, I don't think that's right.
Leopold Magnus 00:16:06 Well, I mean, it looks like a nice space. The grass kind of is disturbed. If I didn't know any better, there would have been a fire pit right there.
Cletus Cobbington 00:16:06 Oh no, that was me.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:16 we look over, it's just like amber fields of grain, just completely undisturbed. The only path is here to the left and over to that spot.
Dungeon Master 00:16:25 Since Cyrus has kind of turned out to be like robot racist you he looks at you and he just goes Are we not sure like we could trust this like robot guy can he even really like track
Kaladen Shash 00:16:41 That's great. Was that Cletus that actually said that? Is that what you're saying? That's even better. He's present. He's present. That's right. Okay. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:16:44 It was me. I did the robot dance very offensively on accident.
Leopold Magnus 00:16:45 I was going to say one of them. That's right.
Dungeon Master 00:16:50 No, no. Um, you did, you did that, but Cyrus is a little too strung up on the fact that like automatons exist and he stares and he, Travis made it very obvious we were playing disc golf that he like made a point to point out how not normal it was to be around Leopold. So I'm going to really play that into when he comes back. He has messed with him being a hater. Anyway, continue guys.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:50 That's funny. So,
Kaladen Shash 00:17:10 OK. I love that.
Cletus Cobbington 00:17:14 Gotcha.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:15 That's great.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:18 So just to recap, we saw the bunny man, Wesley, walk over to the edge of the trees and then stop. He doesn't continue into the forest, and then didn't stop. Interesting. Interesting, OK. He probably jumped. He can probably jump really far because he's a rabbit.
Dungeon Master 00:17:29 you see shit you saw a couple footprints dashing that way and then they disappear before it gets to like the destination yeah like
Zariel Torgan 00:17:48 Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. Yeah, well. Should we hit on down or.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:51 And the door is hastily closed to the illithid crypt.
Dungeon Master 00:17:56 Like if you walk past it and you pushed it close behind you but you didn't look at it, there's a chance it doesn't actually close all the way. Like it's a jar.
Kaladen Shash 00:18:17 Yes, let us go back in. We'll have to swim. How do you do with breathing? Can you do it for a while underwater? Well, not the two robots. Clevis, I'm talking to you, Clevis.
Cletus Cobbington 00:18:17 I guess so. Me?
Zariel Torgan 00:18:27 Me? Who are you asking? That's fair. That's fair. Well, I don't know. I don't know how I feel about that. We might have to get ahold of HR. It needs to be a problem.
Cletus Cobbington 00:18:39 Okay, when you're talking to them, start with robot, but like in a certain type of tone, and then with me, just say, hey, you, okay? No, I can swim just fine. I swim in the creek all the time, every summer.
Leopold Magnus 00:18:48 Hey Zario, what is it with this guy anyways?
Kaladen Shash 00:18:57 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:59 Yeah, so I figure, yeah, we will head in.
Dungeon Master 00:19:00 Okay. You guys, I'll get you to that. Because remember, there's always the first level you kind of find initially as you make your way in.
Cletus Cobbington 00:19:08 I dive in.
Dungeon Master 00:19:29 You head on through, give a nod to the dead rat folk that was in the top corner, and you get to this dark, murky pool. Cletus and Cyrus seeing this are shocked when you see the other members of the party just sort of nonchalantly be like, yep, this is just part of the work, and they dive into it.
Dungeon Master 00:19:50 disappearing underneath the darkness and after this swim through this very unnaturally carved through tunnel you can tell like the topography and the geography the whole terrain is changing and becoming more alien as you're going through the water and you have like all this vegetation hiding a lot of it or for you finally
Dungeon Master 00:20:13 popped out in this very organic, but fake organic looking room. The stone had been melted in a, like, tendinous membrane kind of way. Everything is smooth, rounded edges with weird pockets and holes and striations. And I'm gonna say nothing changed in it. You haven't been gone that long, so you've explored quite a bit of it, killed a few mind flares, but you guys, you wouldn't be at the top here.
Kaladen Shash 00:20:31 Are we assuming we're coming in down here?
Dungeon Master 00:20:44 So as you guys enter, let me know what you want to do. Yeah, you're coming at the entrance to start with, unless you guys just want to go to the same spot. I'll move you there right now.
Kaladen Shash 00:21:02 No, it's OK. Was the entrance here? Is that where we initially came in when we first played it or was it? OK. It's where we came in, OK? I'm going to go ahead and touch everybody in the party so that everybody grows like a new flower. So everybody's got the. You can communicate without having to yell or talk.
Dungeon Master 00:21:14 down there.
Cletus Cobbington 00:21:19 Can mine just be a piece of straw? Wow. Just like the fields.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:31 Oh, nice. Here's just what worked. Did we? That's cool.
Kaladen Shash 00:21:37 Yes, yes it can. You can have straw. Piece of straw popping out of his ear. Okay, excellent. They both have straw. He has wheat. He has a stock of wheat in his ear.
Dungeon Master 00:21:50 Unless they thought it was the same thing. He thinks it's cool. He's got just the base of a wheat stripe thing. It's just like the little beige tube.
Cletus Cobbington 00:21:56 No one likes a copycat, Cyrus. He has a wheat thin. I have actually a wheat sprig.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:02 Did we? Let's see.
Leopold Magnus 00:22:09 Gross.
Dungeon Master 00:22:25 Zario, you were saying? You had, before you broke the pole, had a general sense of like, if you were to cut a straight line going down and right on the map, that is where in your head is the correct way to go.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:27 Oh, no, I was just wondering, looking at the map, didn't we get a feeling that we had a pretty good idea of where we were supposed to be going? Like where the people were coming from?
Dungeon Master 00:22:54 But it was like a pulling sensation. It wasn't like you had a map laid out in your head. Yes, there was the one of the Brian.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:59 Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was just wondering because I know we went up and we went into that room, right? From the opening, we knew it. Yeah. Did you guys want to go up that way and go further, or did you want to go down and check out some of the other rooms?
Leopold Magnus 00:23:25 Well, maybe we can scan through the rest of it just to make a pass. And so I don't know if that's any value. Yep.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:33 Yeah, I think, I think really there's there's two schools of thought. One of them is, you know, we try to explore every single thing our way and we don't miss anything, or we get there, the boss fight.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:48 as soon as possible using the least amount of resources. And then we just clear it on the way back through. I'm cool with either. I'm just curious if you guys have a general thought process. Because I'm good just going in or checking stuff. I got lots of stuff.
Dungeon Master 00:23:56 He is wearing it as a choker, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:23:57 And. Yeah, it's a good point if we want to be fresh for the fight. Oh God. That's funny.
Kaladen Shash 00:24:12 So Cyrus, do you feel anything with your new special? Did we call it a, what is he wearing? Is it like a little choker? Is that what it looks like? Okay. I mean, he's got, he's got our little secret weapon is, I don't know if he can sense them or if he can better navigate towards.
Cletus Cobbington 00:24:19 Yeah, yeah!
Zariel Torgan 00:24:20 So fun.
Dungeon Master 00:24:29 I don't want to do all this for Travis, but I guess I have to. You guys all get an e-sensation when you're in this place. You know that whatever is at the center of this hive mind is aware of your presence and was trying to lure you in and when you
Kaladen Shash 00:24:47 All right.
Dungeon Master 00:24:53 When the only person affected by it originally broke that connection, you saw all of the mind flares that sort of swarmed towards you, which is why you had to get out. You were getting your ass whooped. You ask Cyrus what he feels now, and again, you all have this low-level sense of dread, but Cyrus...
Dungeon Master 00:25:14 Feels very comfortable he doesn't get any of that sensation and you notice that if you stand directly next to him and you kind of clump together you all get a sense of warmth. And I'll say even for the sake of narrative you guys are in this beginning of this dungeon a space and as you're walking down the hallway a little bit. You come across one of the intellect devourers those little brain creatures.
Dungeon Master 00:25:38 And it almost hits an invisible barrier, and it walks completely around the group, unnoticing of your presence. It can't detect you to any extent. So you know that if you are close enough to Cyrus as you make your way through this dungeon, you are not going to be identified by any of the creatures that rely on, like, their psionic powers. You are fully invisible.
Cletus Cobbington 00:25:47 I'll just put them on my shoulders and then everyone
Kaladen Shash 00:26:04 We're saying like 10 feet across? Okay. It's like a beacon.
Dungeon Master 00:26:07 Mechanically 10 feet. Yeah, you have to all be very close to him. His back cracks and creaks in like a really uncomfortable way when you hear it as a friend. He's just so lithe and thin. His hip collides with his rib.
Cletus Cobbington 00:26:16 be on my side. Hear every bone hit each other.
Leopold Magnus 00:26:25 Oh, I don't mind the ride. Uh. Yeah, plus 0.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:25 That's funny. You know, I was thinking it would be kind of funny if whoever had the lowest wisdom just like strapped them to that character. Who has the lowest wisdom?
Kaladen Shash 00:26:48 I'm at a plus two. I'm probably. What's oh, there you go. Oh, there we go. Cyrus needs it. That's that's great. Yeah, you should just be. Really funny that he's got the least then he's rocking that thing.
Cletus Cobbington 00:26:51 I'm a... There you go. And I have the most, so I strap him to me. We all got Nat 20s, I'm pretty sure.
Dungeon Master 00:26:53 Cyrus has a plus zero. Perfect. And then also to remember you guys all rolled a certain kind of save at the end of the session and every single one of you failed. The only person who didn't have to roll it.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:57 Yeah so it's good.
Leopold Magnus 00:26:57 or not very wise. Now, let's take a ride.
Dungeon Master 00:27:19 No, I'm pretty sure you all rolled bad. I think the only one who did good was Travis because he didn't have to roll. Hi. Go ahead. Yeah, I think it was the charisma saving throw.
Cletus Cobbington 00:27:26 Hehe.
Kaladen Shash 00:27:27 I want to say I remember not passing that, because I was like, great. We'll find out what that's going to be. Yeah, that's why it rocked. It's so good for me.
Leopold Magnus 00:27:33 They were pretty low, yeah. I actually can look it up.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:37 Do I get a chance to roll, or is it better if it's bad? Because I do like bad. Oh, charisma? Really, dude? Yeah. Let's see. Charisma. Minus one. Oh, 14.
Cletus Cobbington 00:28:06 This ambience is not very hospitable.
Dungeon Master 00:28:07 You have the same sense of pressure and dread being in this place. Make sure you guys are all in the Spotify jam.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:10 Oh, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:28:29 Oh yeah, the flame.
Kaladen Shash 00:28:29 100%. Absolutely have it. Shall we move about later for a moment to get used to it, or go straight there?
Cletus Cobbington 00:28:37 Where do I join that? I keep missing out on the music.
Dungeon Master 00:28:40 If you go to the chat for this Discord channel, it's the most recent link that I posted.
Kaladen Shash 00:29:05 Perhaps straight there with lots of resources good, you know.
Cletus Cobbington 00:29:08 Yeah. Let's go Ratu.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:18 Oh God.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:20 yeah yeah sorry i was i was getting the music on this is good music by the way yeah i say uh i mean quicker we can get there quicker we can get the bottom or whatever all this uh pressure feet let me get this so you guys want to go up past that part
Dungeon Master 00:29:26 Thanks. Which direction do you go?
Kaladen Shash 00:29:50 We begin to navigate back towards the brine pool, the area we know we got towards.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:53 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:29:58 Up towards the top. You guys pass through. This. Section here. You see nothing. You look down the hall quite a bit and you see like a mind of our sort of just settling on the ground a little bit into a room on there.
Cletus Cobbington 00:30:04 Thank you for watching.
Dungeon Master 00:30:28 Um, the pole does feel really strong that way. Um, but it's. The dread is almost coming more from the tunnel straight ahead instead of straight down. Like the more pressure is ahead of you. As you guys would go around there. You would see another intellect of error, but more importantly, you see a.
Dungeon Master 00:30:54 Another brine pool and give me a perception check as you guys are moving through that that area
Cletus Cobbington 00:31:11 Perception.
Kaladen Shash 00:31:14 Just get him out, Leopold. Shake it off. Shake it off. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:31:18 Yeah, I had some pretty bad ones. Yeah, I think that's the last two rolls. Yeah, that survived one.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:21 At least that's consistent.
Dungeon Master 00:31:31 Okay, 24, 23, 15, gone. You guys see as you're walking by, a moment of hesitation as you get startled because you look into this brine pool, this dark green liquid where you can see like the occasional little tentacle of which in the water of like the little parasites that lie just beneath the surface and hovering above the water, levitating constantly, you see
Zariel Torgan 00:31:51 Thank you. Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:32:01 three mind flares, but they hear you, but they look up and they just don't see you. As long as you stay really close to Cyrus, it almost looks like they're just looking past you. Everybody go ahead and give me stealth Bextel, because you are still audible. Yeah, with advantage.
Cletus Cobbington 00:32:11 Oh, geez, Louise.
Leopold Magnus 00:32:23 Alright, fingers crossed. Alright, so then I'll have a flat roll, nice. This is still fucking hot garbage. Elitist!
Kaladen Shash 00:32:23 with advantage because we're invisible to them? Oh, man, they weren't super good. They're good enough. They're good enough. What is? He's just yelling. He's just yelling at Chip.
Cletus Cobbington 00:32:41 Oh, Jesus. I fall and drop Cyrus real hard. I thought Cyrus was... I faceplant, but since he's on my shoulder, he faceplants from a higher spot to smack.
Dungeon Master 00:32:42 Hi, welcome.
Leopold Magnus 00:32:53 I'm on your shoulders, right? Isn't that what we said? Oh, Cyrus. OK. All right. Well, you said whoever had the lowest wisdom.
Dungeon Master 00:33:09 I heard like full of shit whips along. He goes, oh, he hits the ground. But you guys, I'll pause for a second and one starts to move closer to. You guys. But what you notice, this is what happened as part of the first thing that the guy still check just kind of makes it harder. You see, there is. This.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:09 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:33:39 Like I will bear out an animal folk creature in one of these pods and you see like half of its face is partially transformed into this mind flare and in a different cocoon pod type deal. You see Wesley is unconscious. He looks human, well humanoid at this point, but um, you know that if he's in one of these pods, that means that he has been infected.
Dungeon Master 00:34:09 So you know that he is a time bomb. You don't know when he's going to transform. You do not see any evidence of Tucker. And then as you guys sort of trip over yourself and Cyrus hits his face so hard on the stone. I'll make them visible.
Leopold Magnus 00:34:19 Probably a bad idea just to leave Wesley behind, to be honest. I think it was probably a bad idea. That guy was just cooked immediately.
Cletus Cobbington 00:34:25 😂😂😂
Kaladen Shash 00:34:40 Probably not a bad idea, is that what you said? Yeah, I have no huge investment in trying to get Wesley back. We can do it, yeah, we can do it after we get the main baddie if we want, but I mean, he's gonna change. Yeah, he's done.
Leopold Magnus 00:34:51 No, neither do I. It's done, yeah. Wesley specifically mentioned the hag in the woods, I think, would be the only person to know that kind of thing, right?
Zariel Torgan 00:35:01 Yeah, I don't think that we know of any actual way to bring people back. I mean, in-game, I don't think we even know that it's an option, right? I think she was talking about werewolfism. And then what he was talking about? I mean, it would probably still work.
Kaladen Shash 00:35:12 Correct.
Leopold Magnus 00:35:24 So maybe, maybe I had some. But anyways, something to think about later.
Dungeon Master 00:35:28 She was just talking about the origin of the animal. Oh, no, Jesse, you're right. I think you also asked that question, and it was the same sort of answer.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:32 Oh. Yeah, well, I mean, we're definitely going to hit that. Yeah, I think it was relevant to me, so that's why I remembered it that way. But yeah, OK.
Kaladen Shash 00:35:56 They don't see us, but they're drawn to our noises, this is what you say? Can we try to just continue down the hallway, quickly regather ourselves, or do we want to have conflict? Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:35:59 The plan stands. Yes. Yes, you can. Oh, it's up to you, but you guys can keep moving forward if you'd like.
Leopold Magnus 00:36:24 No, I would say let's make our moves fast.
Kaladen Shash 00:36:29 Yes, let us continue.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:32 Yeah, let's just leave these two.
Dungeon Master 00:36:32 OK, one more round of self-check. Still with advantage, but harder DC. Yes, still have advantage. What's the highest?
Cletus Cobbington 00:36:41 Do we still have advantage? Jesus. Okay, that's tolerable.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:59 You know, I was gonna do Cast Without a Trace, but I decided against it, and I did it the first time, and I thought, you know what, if we do it again, I'm gonna cast it, and then I forgot. And so, I would like to have cast it, if it's not too late. Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:37:03 16. Would you like to adapt it? Is it a response to the mind flayer having walked towards you? Well, hovered towards you? OK, so everybody just add 10 to your roll. So Cletus, 26. Zariel, was your higher at 10?
Cletus Cobbington 00:37:23 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:37:29 Yes.
Dungeon Master 00:37:30 Yeah, so 20, Kaladin 18 is 28. And Leopold, which one was higher for you? Was that just your highest? Oh, because you have disadvantage. 14. You see, 14 is not. It's going to have, it was DC 15 at that point. But, oh, you had 16. No, you're good. I was looking at the other one.
Kaladen Shash 00:37:35 you.
Leopold Magnus 00:37:40 Oh yeah, I had a real flat because you know I have disadvantage.
Cletus Cobbington 00:37:56 Ja.
Dungeon Master 00:37:59 15 with the DC you see as you sort of dash by and you make your way down the tunnel. One of them sort of keeps going and like goes into the hallway, but it looks both directions and it it can't sense you after a certain distance either. You guys. Make your way down. All the way. And you are presented with two packs.
Dungeon Master 00:38:30 straight or to the right. The area to the left is like a big empty room and you see there's like a mind flare there just feeding on some dead creature. Doesn't notice you.
Cletus Cobbington 00:38:45 Icky.
Leopold Magnus 00:38:45 Well, you know what they say, when you see a fork in the road, take it. Well, yes, of course. I just got a point. Well, we should take this fork in the road. It's a good opportunity.
Kaladen Shash 00:38:51 You take the fork. What do you mean take the fork? Yes, let's go by. Let's not go towards the eating minds later. Continues on the hallway.
Zariel Torgan 00:38:51 Yeah. Which way do you point?
Dungeon Master 00:39:05 Down, down or screen left? It's pretty. Uh, if you're listening to the feeling, it's down.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:21 So are we getting guided by the poll anymore? Yeah, down it is. Yeah, let's go down.
Kaladen Shash 00:39:22 Is that what you're saying over here? Where are we getting pulled? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:39:40 You see these abandoned rooms, slow dripping water. You make your way all the way down. Keeps going bit by bit. Eventually, you get to another fork in the road.
Cletus Cobbington 00:40:06 Nothing.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:08 Does it feel like more down?
Kaladen Shash 00:40:08 Do we, as you can see, do we feel something? Perhaps there's doorway into where we feel it.
Dungeon Master 00:40:11 It is equal at the fork where you're at. It feels like it's pulling you directly into the wall. And I'll put a center on it. It feels like you're getting drawn directly to there. Like through it. Something that way.
Leopold Magnus 00:40:28 like potentially there's a chamber or something that we don't know about from behind the wall.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:38 Yeah, do you want to go around this way further down and then see what we see? Yeah, we'll take a left. We'll stage left. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:40:45 Yes, let us go around the hall, look for doors.
Dungeon Master 00:40:52 left goes into this. There's a hallway above, a hallway in front, a hallway down, and it continues. Oh, thanks.
Cletus Cobbington 00:41:02 Yep.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:09 Can I just say that this is a great map? Yeah, let's keep rounding these things.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:13 That's huge. I guess we'd also all be moving together for the sake of.
Dungeon Master 00:41:25 Yeah. I think I'm going to put Gleedeth on there. I don't think Trace has a character 2 move. I'm bored.
Cletus Cobbington 00:41:38 Maybe because I was a pig last time. Nice. Nice.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:46 I thought he was pretty lively. Hey, Rex, what was that word that you used? I've never heard it before. He said you wanted to like, it was like an AC word with the circlet. You wanted to like, get its goodies. Yeah, what does that mean? Attenuated.
Dungeon Master 00:41:57 Ahem.
Leopold Magnus 00:42:06 Oh, like attenuated? Effectively, attenuation is where you make a small change or something. I think it commonly comes in to referencing equipment that makes frequencies. You can kind of attenuate the frequency or maybe the amplitude of how much power it puts out. So I guess what I was trying to do is get in there with a fine tune and just kind of turn it up a little bit.
Dungeon Master 00:42:31 Shredding fellows.
Leopold Magnus 00:42:37 Sorry, a second. All right.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:38 Gotcha, gotcha. No, I've totally, I just, I'd never heard that word before. I thought it was cool. I just wanted to mention it in the moment, but it got passed. So I figured I'd bring it up now because it's a good time. So do we keep rounding this corner?
Dungeon Master 00:43:04 Keep going down the main hall. It's not so much flesh as it's like almost like a mockery of flesh, but it's like stone like these creatures use all of this telepathic force and everything. You feel like it was sculpted. But it's just got like big round lines. It looks almost like a lining of tissue.
Cletus Cobbington 00:43:06 Jep.
Kaladen Shash 00:43:06 Yes. Jonathan, is it, is it still, is it still like just super fleshy? Like that's all we're kind of in now. Like no real stone or. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I get you now.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:07 in the same way else.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:38 Yeah. Yeah. Let's keep, let's keep cooking. That's funny.
Kaladen Shash 00:43:41 Good. Motherfuckers. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:43:46 You just keep going, keep going. Very funny. This goes all the way. That staircase is below it, but up. And then as you turn the corner, you see where you were. There's this path over here that you didn't see. And as you go down, empty room, but.
Dungeon Master 00:44:07 Isn't that funny? You guys took the wrong way. You go down. This whole thing is in constant downgrade. You are descending into the earth. It's getting colder, more moist. The walls begin like dripping with dark liquid. But it's too dark in here to discern if it's got color to it or if it's just water. But everything seems to get like...
Cletus Cobbington 00:44:09 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:44:10 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:44:30 just very alive and wet and at some point you almost feel like you can feel everything breathing and you just continue to descend and descend before you come into the hallway that levels out and you're not seeing any illithids around here there are no mind flares at this depth it's eerily quiet other than the dripping of the water um and it's it's
Cletus Cobbington 00:44:54 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dungeon Master 00:44:57 Too quiet, like the fact that you were so close to Cyrus as you're all moving down. It's like as if you put like a helmet on like everything around is just doled. You don't hear anything of this. These creatures use like primarily telepathic links to convey anything so. It's almost like you're walking through a war field with earmuffs on like it's just totally quiet. And you hit this eventually this room.
Dungeon Master 00:45:24 And give me a marching order as you guys are walking in. Who would be first? Who would be last? How would you guys organize it?
Kaladen Shash 00:45:33 Very tight circle of people still. I can be, I can be a little bit in the front. Don't.
Leopold Magnus 00:45:36 Yeah, I'm making room for Jesus, but I do have my hands hovering around Cletus's hips. Kind of trying to shimmy with him at the same speed.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:38 I'll just, uh... Yeah, I'll be up front, too. I've got really good wisdom, so I feel like I'm pretty good at fending off attacks, so I'll be up right behind Kaladin.
Cletus Cobbington 00:45:44 Whoa. Yeah, I guess me and Cyrus are just in the middle of the line, so we could be... So Cyrus could be in the middle of everybody.
Kaladen Shash 00:46:01 Yes.
Cletus Cobbington 00:46:13 Or I can move to the back. I don't have much more support than anything.
Dungeon Master 00:46:14 Okay. You guys walk in Cowden being sort of the leader with
Dungeon Master 00:46:30 Cyrus directly behind, Cletus sort of to the side, Leopold hugging him on the other side, Azariel sort of on the flank of it. You walk in, you have this huge open space. Instantly the first thing you see just ground to ceiling going distance out as sort of the measurement of how it arrives to you. You see two mind flares that are like
Dungeon Master 00:46:55 They're dressed very plainly. They don't have like a top half of clothing on. It's like a belted tunic at the waist. Their fleshy squid like cephalopodic bodies are just like
Zariel Torgan 00:47:01 party.
Dungeon Master 00:47:08 They've got like metallic armbands on. They seem more of like a fighting force than other ones. You've seen the very, very muscular frames and they're at the base of these large staircase that as it ascends on both sides, it comes around this enormous hollowed out skull. And in the center of the skull is this dark green purple fluid.
Dungeon Master 00:47:32 that just bubbles. You see movement of water but nothing breached the surface yet. The room fills out and you see these pillars that go floor to ceiling. Except for the ones in the back, you see two pillars that are cut halfway down and chained on them
Zariel Torgan 00:47:38 Bye-bye.
Dungeon Master 00:47:53 like legs to the ground, hands to the ground too, in almost like a front bowing position. There are two mind flares and you see this visible like psychic energy coming off of their head into like a straight beam that funnels into the pond.
Cletus Cobbington 00:48:07 Thank you for watching.
Dungeon Master 00:48:10 So to visualize that, there are two illithids in the back corner, and each of them has a beam coming. The best way to describe it is a thread of beam that connects them to the water, the water that you can't see through, this enormous alien-looking skull, two sort of bruisers in front, and then the room is otherwise seems to be empty. And that is what you take in at this moment. Yes.
Kaladen Shash 00:48:36 Jonathan, did you say chained? They're chained, so they look like they are unable to move, restrained?
Dungeon Master 00:48:45 unclear from across the room. You guys are like 120 feet back. There is, I'll show you one there and one there. They're like on elevated pillars. Yeah, not to the ceiling. The ones right here,
Leopold Magnus 00:48:49 So Jonathan, you said there was two back here. Are those pillars?
Cletus Cobbington 00:48:55 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:12 Silence.
Dungeon Master 00:49:13 And right here, go floor to ceiling. You can't get on top of those. Just the ones in the back. You don't see anything coming off of them. And you guys are like this gap in their sight, right? You seem almost invisible to this point.
Leopold Magnus 00:49:18 Got it. OK. And they're all chained or just the two in the back? Interesting. And the two up front don't have a mental link to the pond?
Dungeon Master 00:49:42 But as you guys step into the room, you hear this loud groaning sound as like the physical room that you're in begins to shake. And you hear almost like scratched through the mouth of the illithids who don't use their vocals at all. It is this hoarse voice as it's being forced to talk. And you just hear it just goes, I feel you.
Dungeon Master 00:50:12 I'm not feeling and you can tell that it probably has a pretty good sense of everything it's whatever this is so powerful and there is a bubble of invisibility in it that is walking through it space so you are. No but not now.
Kaladen Shash 00:50:22 Yeah. No. Don't think I take an action. That's fine, that's fine.
Dungeon Master 00:50:34 Yeah, if we're going to get into it, we'll do. Everybody gets to do just something right off the top. You can just free ball it off in the air and tell me. Then we're going to roll initiative. And then we're going to take a quick smoke break. I'm also going to grab some dinner real quick. It'll be like five minutes max. And we'll get into the big fight that'll probably take us a bit. Bless. And Bless has a limit to four, correct?
Kaladen Shash 00:50:54 I'm gonna cast bless and everything. Everyone's within radius so. Um? Yeah, I can upcast it to get all four. We have five in the party I.
Zariel Torgan 00:50:56 Okay. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:51:04 Unless you upcast it. OK, well, I mean the party is how much do you guys get five total? OK.
Kaladen Shash 00:51:24 Yeah, so it's three. It's three. So up up level is plus one. So I get four people under bless. Who has really good? Who's really good wisdom already? OK. I will do. I will do me, Cyrus and Leopold. And cast it at the regular.
Cletus Cobbington 00:51:37 I do. You know, plus four.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:38 I'm good. I got a plus five.
Leopold Magnus 00:51:39 I have terrible wisdom.
Dungeon Master 00:51:42 Cyrus has a plus zero Okay Cyrus will Pick all of you and you gain resistance to psychic damage for one minute and
Kaladen Shash 00:51:55 my regular level one. And the bonus day, the bonus again, we have
Dungeon Master 00:52:08 not requiring concentration. So you do not have to be close to him to gain this benefit. You just feel this warmth sort of flush over your head as you get this bonus. You have resistance to psychic damage for one minute. Yeah, that is his one of the big ability of this circuit.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:21 Nice. That's from the circlet, or did you cast that? OK.
Kaladen Shash 00:52:26 Systems sort of help. All right.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:39 Nice. So I have the ability to, I've got polymorph. If there's something that, there's somebody that wants to like do some fighting as a creature, just right off the bat and soak up a bunch of hit points, we could. Just as a thought, I don't know how much out of game planning we can do Jonathan, but that's something I could do.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:09 somebody if they want it. So I can cast up to your level of a CR, and so like a Giant Ape, or a Mammoth, or something is something that I could do. Let's see, I can turn Yawa
Dungeon Master 00:53:13 You guys do what you want. I'm not going to restrict that.
Leopold Magnus 00:53:33 You can turn into that.
Kaladen Shash 00:53:34 It has to be something you've seen, right? Something you've already seen. It can't be something to nothing.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:42 Yeah, that's true, that's true. I mean, there's things in here that I definitely haven't seen that I'm not, like, choosing as options. I assume that, like, maybe in the history books we've seen, like, a mammoth. Jonathan, does it count if I've seen it, like, a depiction of it?
Dungeon Master 00:53:57 If you've only seen a depiction, it'll be like a pretty easy check to do it. And then the more obscure will make it harder.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:16 I can turn somebody into a mammoth with 126 hit points. They do 4d8 plus 7 on a gore attack, and 4d10 plus 7 on a stomp, plus 5.
Kaladen Shash 00:54:24 Damn. What's their constitution? I mean, yikes.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:35 And then I could turn somebody into a giant ape, which is 157 hit points, 3d10 plus 6 to hit, and 7d6 plus 6 on a rock ranged attack, plus 9 to hit. And that's got a con of plus 4. So those are my two options.
Kaladen Shash 00:54:54 Leopold, Leopold, would you like to be giant metal ape?
Leopold Magnus 00:54:58 Ooh, oh dear. Well, I can't say I've ever been one before, but I'll give it a shot.
Zariel Torgan 00:55:07 Yeah, so as we're walking in, I'll just kind of tap you on the shoulder, say, well, no time like the present. And I'll go ahead and I will attempt, what kind of check were you wanting for that, Jonathan? Just check, okay. That's a natural one.
Dungeon Master 00:55:23 Just give me a wisdom check. Something that's like just testing your abilities. Which one were you going for?
Kaladen Shash 00:55:37 giddy up he's going off it's going to be scary looking and misshapen
Zariel Torgan 00:55:40 That's a... I was going to try to turn... So it's one of my fourth level stealth slots. I was going to try to use Polymorph to turn... Let's see, to turn the... Oh, a giant ape. Leo into a giant ape.
Cletus Cobbington 00:55:51 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:55:54 Yeah, what were you gonna turn him into? You still get the giant ape stats, but you turn him into, like, a normal-sized ape. You just go for this really big, grand creature, you describe it as being really terrifying, and...
Dungeon Master 00:56:15 You throw it out, and the magic takes him. And Leopold, you rise in the air, and your body starts to morph, and you're expecting this huge explosion. And then you're just kind of like a chimpanzee, but you're really strong.
Leopold Magnus 00:56:30 I'm just like, uh, take a seat on my ass and start scratching underneath my armpit. And, uh, I turned to the group and I say, Oh, what are you guys all looking at? And you just hear unless you speak. Oh, oh yes. I almost forgot. Um, what are you looking at?
Kaladen Shash 00:56:43 You can still speak. You can still speak in your mind. Just use the connection.
Cletus Cobbington 00:56:46 Näh?
Zariel Torgan 00:56:57 Actually, a point of order, you don't get to keep your mental stats. So you have an intelligence of minus two. So I think five is verbal, right? So I think six, yeah. So you're seven, which means you could probably be like,
Leopold Magnus 00:57:05 Okay, oh God. So really all you're hearing is grunts and grunts and monkey.
Dungeon Master 00:57:16 Yes, six. I think it's five or six. He is real, really dumb. You know your drives and your motivation, like it'll never be the scenario where you guys like have to worry about him killing you. You don't, you recognize like good and bad and you know what you wanted to do. But yeah, you're not having fluid conversation right now.
Kaladen Shash 00:57:25 Yes, we're just getting a motion. We're just getting a motion.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:28 Yeah, yeah, yeah. You just hug a little too hard.
Leopold Magnus 00:57:53 And I just start to wander off like I'm just kind of wandering out of the group And I'm looking at the ground maybe picking up ants or something You on a d20 And
Zariel Torgan 00:58:01 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:58:03 Roll for ant. Let's see you bite an ant. Nah, there's no ants.
Kaladen Shash 00:58:05 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:58:19 I find a little twig that I can put in my mouth, put in my lips. In the midst of this, I'm starting to wander away. I'm not paying any attention.
Dungeon Master 00:58:23 This is, again, like very stone-shaped, organic, goopy, moist. It's kind of alien and grotesque. Everything's got like a little bit of slime coming off of it. You get a little frustrated looking for a twig and you're just not one.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:45 Do we wanna start killing these dudes? Yep. Ooh.
Leopold Magnus 00:58:51 But yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:58:51 Uh, can I do one thing real quick? I would love to cast Conjure Woodland Fiends. And I summon four Satyrs, little goat boys next to me. And they're all doing a little happy jig. Yep.
Dungeon Master 00:58:55 Yeah, everybody gets a thing. OK. Nice. You say four? I think I can take, let's see.
Cletus Cobbington 00:59:25 It says you summon fate creatures, you can do 4 challenger and half or lower. Yeah, half or lower. Satyrs are the half. Bang chest eaten banana.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:26 Well, you have a range attack. 50 to 100 feet.
Dungeon Master 00:59:27 Yeah, let me just work on getting tokens on.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:39 Um, what does this monkey like, uh, is there an action I can prepare as a monkey? Like, or is it just like hit things? I have arranged.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:57 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a rock. It's the same thing as like a stone giant. You get two melee attacks per round, and then one of them is a fist, and then one of them is a ranged rock attack, which is a plus nine. So you could pick up a rock and throw it, or you could pick up somebody and throw it. Do you have the stats, or do you need a...
Kaladen Shash 01:00:03 Look. Trying it man.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:13 Okay. Yeah. Okay. Good deal. Uh, yeah, I don't, I don't know where to find the stats. I guess I could just pick it up, but I'm not a full monkey. Am I? Okay. All right. Is that, that was flare that I got kind of small. Got it.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:31 Yeah, you're a Chinese. Yeah, no, it's no. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, if you go to D&D Beyond, yeah, yeah, yeah. You should have a lot of hit points, like 100, 157. So, be cool.
Dungeon Master 01:00:33 your journey.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:41 Yeah, I can pull up a block, yeah. Yeah, got lots of hit points. OK, and multi-attack, two-fist attacks, yeah. Yeah, the rock attack is 7d6 plus 6. Yeah, fuck, all right, I get it.
Cletus Cobbington 01:00:45 My troop. Jesus.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:56 Yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty powerful. I mean, 3d 10 plus six per hit is pretty good.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:00 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:01:13 I don't know why, but I really want to call you King Kong right now. I don't know why it's in my head.
Leopold Magnus 01:01:19 I'm like, look at France.
Zariel Torgan 01:01:24 I like to imagine that they think that they see this like sophisticated group of adventurers come in, because there's this like void that they can't see. And then Leo's so stupid, he steps out of it and they just see this big ass monkey.
Dungeon Master 01:01:34 Oh yeah 100%. As soon as the monkey roams off you see the two sort of mind flayer brutes snap their heads and look down and they still levitate you notice they kind of just fly forward and so it'll all start off with not you guys getting like a surprise on them you
Cletus Cobbington 01:01:39 I see a monkey in Fort Goatman.
Dungeon Master 01:02:03 Leopold has been spotted in a monkey farm. I forgot that you said you just ran out. You still all get your one thing though. So we have summon woodland creatures. Polymorph. Kaladin, you got anything? Left. Cyrus.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:11 What?
Zariel Torgan 01:02:12 Yes. Did I not get this? Was that the one? Or did we get everybody?
Kaladen Shash 01:02:20 I cast Bless. Yeah. No, I couldn't get, yeah. Yeah, Leopold and myself. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:02:32 Three people got it, three lowest. So I think it was Cyrus. Was it Leopold also? Yes. Who would you like to hold?
Zariel Torgan 01:02:41 Okay, that's cool. I just was double checking. Could that be like your one thing?
Leopold Magnus 01:02:45 So can I just hold an action or something like that, I guess, as a monkey? Can I just throw a rock? Yeah, just a rock toss or something. Yeah, that's what I was kind of wondering.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:59 Rock, toss, tag. That's great. Rock.
Dungeon Master 01:03:07 Yeah. Hand cocked back, other hand pointed forward. You got it really loaded. Cyrus will do a cantrip. He'll cast true strike on the one that's just right in front. Everybody go ahead and roll initiative. Travis used it last time. That's why I used it. Trying to keep it in character.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:22 This might be the one time I've seen True Strike used. Oh, okay. I was gonna say, I don't think I... Oh! Natural 20. It'd just be your dex for the ape. Though, plus two.
Leopold Magnus 01:03:23 Oh, I guess it's... Yeah, I have it. I have it. I just, it's just tough to use that over other things. Does the APE have, it just shares my initiative? Okay. Plus two. Yeah. Hey, 21.
Cletus Cobbington 01:03:27 Strike through. Do I need one?
Zariel Torgan 01:03:53 Nice, some good rolls. All right, sounds good. All right, sounds good.
Dungeon Master 01:04:00 Okay, okay. We'll touch base back in a little bit. Talk to you guys soon.
Cletus Cobbington 01:04:05 New York.
Kaladen Shash 01:04:09 All right, sweet. I think Cletus might have walked away from my
Leopold Magnus 01:04:10 See ya. Well, while we have some time, Cyrus, do you want to see what I've been drafting up? I was going to say, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:04:40 I guess I can just share them. They turn out pretty cool. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, here, I'll put it in.
Kaladen Shash 01:04:40 Yeah. Or do you, are you, are you asking AI to create little guns or something like images? Open the chat.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:09 Why can't I? Oh, I just have to add it that way. Isn't that great? Yeah. With the squirrel, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:05:28 Yeah, he wants a clip. I like, I like the shorty one. I love the shorty one with the diagrams. Like that is bonkers. That's perfect. With the squirrel on it. Oh man. That's cool. Maybe, maybe he turns acorns into like little, little brass balls and that's what he's shooting out of the shotgun.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:53 Yeah, I just thought it would be funny if they were like little exploding acorns or something. No, I did wizard to, you know, basically take second level spells.
Kaladen Shash 01:05:58 Oh, hell yeah. What did you take? Did you take another level of artificer? Or did you go? That's good, yeah. Welcome to the second level club. What was the school of magic you took?
Leopold Magnus 01:06:24 It's, uh, I think it's conjuration is what it's called. So I don't know when those spells come into play. Are those something that I'll just get later? Right. Oh.
Kaladen Shash 01:06:28 OK. No, so conjuration is a type of magic. So you perform those types of magic often more easily or better. Or as you get further levels, if you cast that type of magic, it might automatically do more damage just because you're of that school.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:56 OK, OK, I dig that. Right. Which is super helpful too, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:06:59 your cantrips get powerful when you use those ones eventually. But I mean, it's all level-based. Like Jonathan said, too, I didn't realize that as you also just get higher levels, like we're eighth level, even though I don't have third-level spell slots, I have gained another second-level spell. So you do get additional spell slots eventually, which is nice. Yeah, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:23 Yeah, well, I guess we haven't really gone back to the barracks to prepare some new spells, but I was looking at some of them. I was kind of thinking about taking this rope trap, or what's this called? Rope trick, yeah, which seems like a very convenient way to disappear really, really fast. Right.
Kaladen Shash 01:07:34 Rope trick. It's right. It is essentially mechanically like our little toolbox where you just climb up this rope. And you can just look down through like an invisible hole and just hang out in this invisible box.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:55 Yeah, you know, pull the ladder or the rope up and hide up there or something, you know, you could like basically turn a corner, pass that climb up there and disappear.
Kaladen Shash 01:08:05 Yeah. It's a pretty. That's a pretty fun one. That's good. I think I have. My second level right now or. You gotta shatter. Where is it nice? Shatters fun. Shatters fun just cause I can control that like so I vacation is mine.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:26 Also looking at blur. Oh, shatter is a great one. Oh, yeah, so you can sculpt it. That's classic. The evocation one is powerful for that reason. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:08:35 So even though it's an AOE, I can still sculpt it. So as a fighter, I can just center it on myself and just be like, don't kill the people.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:01 That's a good point. Yeah, you just boom, shatter explodes around you. That's sick.
Kaladen Shash 01:09:05 Yeah. Let's see though, I don't even name sure what my spell books got. Entirely active right now.
Cletus Cobbington 01:09:18 Jesse, are you back? Oh my god. Wait. How did you do that? That's the head of the squirrel.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:25 Oh yo, Trace, I put some gun designs in the chat for you to take a look at if any of those peak are fancy. I also have one other one I'm cooking up here. It's an image generator. Sick, isn't it?
Cletus Cobbington 01:09:52 Damn. Yeah, that's sick as hell. Oh, the acorn bullets? That's fucking awesome. I love that.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:07 Yeah, yeah, they're acorn wolves. Yeah, here's this other one. This one, this was totally different stuff. It can be converted. You can remove the stock if you need to. Kind of like a fucking scope. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:10:08 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:10:25 Oh Jesus, just a full on... I like how it went from like... Fantasy Squirrel Gun to Call of Duty. That's sick. I mean, I love the idea of like, a rifle for sake of... I mean, both work. Like, shotgun for sake of, you know, just loading a bunch of acorns. Or rifle for the one. I like that idea.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:50 Yeah. And this one also shoots acorns, but you know, they're more, they're more tuned to be like bullets type. Yeah. I'm not super familiar with how that mechanic works.
Cletus Cobbington 01:10:57 That's cool. Yeah, I was looking through just like, you know, basic like gun weapons in general. For like, what would you like? To be so specific. Rifle.
Cletus Cobbington 01:11:25 Let's see, so basic hunting rifle does 2d10 piercing. What does a shotgun do? Kind of based off which one can give me a little bit easier damage. Shotgun does 2d8, so like, yeah. I like that first squirrel one in, like, a rifle. That'd be really cool. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:11:28 It seems reasonable.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:49 Yeah. I mean, you could just say it's rifle. The control over these, I'm still figuring out. But this image generator I found is, I think, a little better than that ideogram one, by the way, if you guys haven't played around. Seems like you can generate more.
Cletus Cobbington 01:11:56 Yeah. Yeah, I don't know how accurate your craft could be, but that'd be sick.
Dungeon Master 01:12:11 Oh, that's sweet. We're all back. That was our last one. I eat?
Leopold Magnus 01:12:17 more images than the other one, a lot faster.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:31 Yeah, I'm good. All right, so I reached over, touched Leo.
Cletus Cobbington 01:12:32 Ja.
Kaladen Shash 01:12:37 You're good to go.
Dungeon Master 01:12:41 Okay. To start the initiative off, we have Zariel Torgan. How would you like to kick off the fight? Yes, I switch over the music to RV.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:01 Cast Polymorph. Now I have to maintain concentration. I'm going to rip into my bear form. Do I want to do that? I want to do something else. Yeah. I'm going to, yeah, I'm going to rip into my bear form and wild shape. Let me just mark the thing off. Right there.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:31 All right, and then I'm gonna try to move, where am I, is that me? Yeah. Oh, you already got me there, perfect, thank you. I'm gonna move up, where is he? There he is. I'm gonna move up. Okay, I'm gonna go around this side of this guy, hopefully to give somebody advantage. I'm gonna make two bear attacks once I get to my bear page.
Dungeon Master 01:13:46 Oh, you're the bear, so I'm just moving your token away.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:01 All right, so I'm gonna make one claw and one bite. 25 to hit on the claw. Oh, a natural 20 on the bite. Nice.
Cletus Cobbington 01:14:04 My fair peach.
Kaladen Shash 01:14:21 Yes. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:14:21 Oh, great time to play that. That's funny. Go ahead and roll your crit damage.
Leopold Magnus 01:14:28 I'm trying to get it on my laptop here, but I guess it just played for the whole. Sorry. Oh, weird. Yeah. How the hell do I get this?
Cletus Cobbington 01:14:34 I was like, interesting choice. That was ace. Change it back, I want the bear to be wicked. Damn.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:34 That's some real fight music. All right, so. All right. Yeah, I'm doing, I'm doing backflips. And then bite attack, it's going to be 28 damage.
Dungeon Master 01:15:04 Twenty-eight damage. Twelve and twenty-eight, okay. Forty, then? Instantly looking very hurt.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:04 Oh, 12 on the clause and 28 on the bite. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, lore. I just saved lore.
Cletus Cobbington 01:15:05 Damn. Oh wait, I think I needed to roll initiative for my satyrs. Should I do that right now?
Dungeon Master 01:15:34 Let's say they all go on the same initiative. Let me add one for all of them. This thing's got a cool thing where you can do group initiatives.
Cletus Cobbington 01:15:35 Do I roll? They're on the same. Oh, 30, 20. Wait.
Kaladen Shash 01:15:58 Thanks, Cole.
Dungeon Master 01:16:04 And they are 20. Cool. Um, okay. Uh, heavy hit out of czar. It'll start to turn up. Next is the John, uh, the normal size eight. That is Leopold. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:23 Yeah, can you guys hear me all right? I'm still working on my laptop. Awesome. So after wandering over into this area and being spotted, I think monkey see monkey do. I'm going to jump up on this pillar and kind of straddle it like King Kong and beat my chest and go.
Cletus Cobbington 01:16:27 Jep.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:47 And this largest stone from this column, I'm assuming it's got to have some stone somewhere. And just huck a ringer right at this guy. And let's see, what's the... I'm gonna look up this stat block on for hit.
Dungeon Master 01:16:56 Sure. OK.
Kaladen Shash 01:17:18 76 plus six. Oh, it's a plus nine to hit. Rock.
Leopold Magnus 01:17:21 Plus 9. Yeah, plus 9. Okay. 14, 23 to hit. This is, yeah, yeah, he has a multi-attack. This is its ranged rock, which is the action I held, kind of the one that I did.
Dungeon Master 01:17:36 23 hits. And what is his ability? What is 76? Bam. Yeah, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:17:49 And yeah, it's 76 plus six bludgeoning damage. 76. Yikes. Plus six. Oh Jesus. So that's 33 damage with that one stone just hurtling.
Zariel Torgan 01:17:53 Yeah, it's the same as like a stone giant. Just the way they throw a rock, it's like ungodly powerful. Oh my God.
Cletus Cobbington 01:17:56 Jesus Christ. Ape, ape the rock, rock to her.
Dungeon Master 01:18:08 27. You flatten it. It becomes a smear of greenish blood as the rock slides into the feet of the bear. You have killed this one.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:17 across the room, smashing. All right, the ape is pumped. Okay, so I guess that was my held action. Did I just get my real action now? All right.
Kaladen Shash 01:18:28 Mmm.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:28 Holy smoke. Hot damn.
Dungeon Master 01:18:39 Yep, sure. Let's see it.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:41 Yeah, the ape. And he jumps off the pillar and does this little spin backflip and in midair through his legs, he throws another stone at this one. And see if it hits. Oh baby, that's gonna connect.
Cletus Cobbington 01:19:00 Uh huh.
Leopold Magnus 01:19:11 Uh, cause that's plus nine. Yeah. So, uh, that's another 60 seconds. 20, 30 Ford image with that, with that rock.
Dungeon Master 01:19:11 I guess it will. Come on, man. This is supposed to be a hard fight.
Kaladen Shash 01:19:28 What good rolls? What good? What good rolls? What good rolls? Yes, the Halo music's perfect for that. Why so hard?
Zariel Torgan 01:19:28 Oh my god. Holy shit. Oh man. Yeah, we're gonna kill this one and it's gonna have like 50 and the next one's gonna have like 150 and we're gonna be like, I wonder why. Yeah, why'd it get so hard all of a sudden?
Leopold Magnus 01:19:37 Remember this is in midair as I'm doing a somersault. I just fucking launch one through my legs Yeah
Zariel Torgan 01:20:00 Oh, man.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:02 Okay, so I imagine he's looking pretty hurt. When I land on the ground here, Ape is gonna kind of Donkey Kong slap his hands on the ground, you know, kind of churn up some dust. And I'm gonna run straight at him and I'm gonna uppercut with a wound up mechanical spinning arm. And that will be my fist attack. That's also a plus nine.
Dungeon Master 01:20:15 You can do two fist attacks or the rock attack. Yeah. It does that much more damage because it's the single.
Cletus Cobbington 01:20:30 ... ... ... ...
Kaladen Shash 01:20:32 Yeah. One action still.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:33 Oh, okay, I thought it was, I see. It makes two fist attacks, got it. I was gonna say, this guy is fucking OP. All right, then I will land, I'll kind of kick up some dust, and that will be my turn. I'll approach this closer, mind flayer.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:40 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:20:50 OK. Up next, initiative count 20. You guys are going to go in an order. Everybody's going to do it at least once, obviously, because of how it works and how long it takes. But somebody roll me a D20.
Cletus Cobbington 01:21:13 HUSA!
Zariel Torgan 01:21:16 I can get it. Yeah, we'll do it in the order of initiative. So low is good, right? But I don't need this. Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
Kaladen Shash 01:21:16 Yes, yes, whoever's at the top of those roles. Crushed it. Now some layer privilege. There we go. How many new mind players are running in? All all all four. Here he goes.
Dungeon Master 01:21:29 Yeah. Go ahead and roll me a D4. Almost as if predicted, but just not quite the same. You see flying down the side out of like a hole in the wall.
Cletus Cobbington 01:21:44 Hahaha.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:48 This is concrete.
Kaladen Shash 01:21:49 Let's go.
Dungeon Master 01:21:59 being drawn in, you see two more mind flares. And this is a race platform, so they're just kind of going alongside of it. And then that's all that happens on the lair count for that rising out of the brine pool at with initiative of 20. The elder brain, you see these tentacles sort of flop onto the brim of the skull as it sort of
Zariel Torgan 01:22:24 Ooh. Awesome.
Cletus Cobbington 01:22:24 Ja.
Dungeon Master 01:22:27 forces itself and you see it uses as much levitation power as it can but it is so large as it rises that it almost props itself up and the whole room shakes as you hear this mental screeching happening and on its turn what will the elder brain do
Cletus Cobbington 01:22:58 Think real good.
Dungeon Master 01:22:58 How far away are you, Zario? Kind of floats up, comes forward just a little bit, about that far, and you see a tentacle whips out after you with a range of 30 feet on that.
Zariel Torgan 01:23:04 Let me get the ruler. I am 40, a little over 40. Oh, shit.
Dungeon Master 01:23:30 And then I pre-rolled the damages, so I'll roll the hit and I'll roll for extra stuff, but the damage is just in an order. 22 to hit. Okay, you take 19 points of blood genie damage. Are you a huge or smaller creature?
Zariel Torgan 01:23:39 Okay. Oh yeah, I'm a bear. Hang on, let me get this damage added. Is it 19 damage? Okay, and then I am a large beast.
Dungeon Master 01:24:00 19. OK. So you are grappled. At the start of your turn, you will take 1d8 plus 5 psychic damage, but that will be halved, obviously, because you are resistant. OK. And that is all it does.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:09 Okay. Wait, why am I resistant to psychic damage? Is this circlet? Okay. Double check.
Kaladen Shash 01:24:31 Or Cyrus, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:24:32 Because of the circlet, yeah. You see, after it does this tentacle attack, the mind flare that's sort of chained up at the top left corner of the screen, it surges with this arcane energy. And you see around the older brain that was invisible to you before, there's this shimmer of arcane energy.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:46 Silence.
Dungeon Master 01:25:01 almost just like a few inches off of any surface. It sort of just quickly almost coats the whole thing before going invisible again. And that is all that happens. On this turn, Cletus, you are up next. What is their deck and what is your deck?
Cletus Cobbington 01:25:16 I think it's my Sayers before me, but it works both in the same. Their dex was... plus three. Yeah, plus one. How far is it to the chained up guys?
Dungeon Master 01:25:30 And what is your deck? Is it less than that? Okay, then it is your satyrs. It's pretty far. From you, they are, no, 130 feet.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:38 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:25:47 Is it 320 feet? Well, uh, my little satyrs are gonna try and all shortbow the one on the left, I think. Okay, they got plus five. I'm just gonna, let's see, okay. They do.
Dungeon Master 01:26:03 Nice. Roll the hit. Sure.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:15 Can I ask a clarifying question? Did it appear as if the guys on the pedestals were powering this force field thing? Did they burst energy into it? Or did we just happen to see it for some reason?
Cletus Cobbington 01:26:29 All right, it's plus five to those.
Dungeon Master 01:26:33 It, you saw on its turn, the equivalent, it sent a surge of energy towards the other brain that you then saw a glimmer of some sort of like protective coating. Yeah. Yes.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:49 But it seemed like it came from them to it, not the other way around. OK. All right. Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:27:01 you
Dungeon Master 01:27:04 Okay, let me just get acquainted with its AC. First one misses, second one misses, third one hits, fourth one hits.
Cletus Cobbington 01:27:11 Okay, let's see. I'm just going to roll their damage together. So they have plus three, so when I'm rolling both, I'll just do plus six, right?
Zariel Torgan 01:27:33 you.
Dungeon Master 01:27:41 13. Maybe some men. OK.
Cletus Cobbington 01:27:48 Thirteen. Alright, and I... And I'll just have them all stay back there since... Um... And then really me... Um, let's see... I don't know if there's one...
Cletus Cobbington 01:28:17 Ooh, that can't go far. Let's see... How far am I from Big Brain? Like, 80 feet? 90 feet? Okay, I'm gonna cast a third-level Moonbeam
Dungeon Master 01:28:18 90.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:47 All right.
Cletus Cobbington 01:28:49 5ft radius, 40ft cylinder, on a point within range. So I got 120 range, so I'm just going to blast it straight down on Big Brain. So, when it enters a spell's area for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn there, it's engulfed in flames, causing searing pain.
Dungeon Master 01:28:58 And then at the start of its turn or when it.
Kaladen Shash 01:29:14 Silence.
Cletus Cobbington 01:29:18 I must make a constitution saving throw. It says when a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts a turn there. So I guess right now. Yeah. So it needs to be to 15. Sure.
Dungeon Master 01:29:30 Yeah. Constitution save, you said? That is an eight.
Zariel Torgan 01:29:46 Uh, uh.
Cletus Cobbington 01:29:47 All right, so it takes... What did I say? I said third level? So it takes 3D10. Oh, a 0, that's awesome. Oh, a 10, never mind. All right. Let's see. All right.
Dungeon Master 01:30:00 Well, it's actually shillelagh.
Kaladen Shash 01:30:04 Thanks.
Cletus Cobbington 01:30:15 And I'll just bonus action Schleyly just cuz. And I think I'll stay on back here with my boys. I know, I saw Zero and I was like, wait, what? No.
Zariel Torgan 01:30:26 That really would be the biggest. That's funny. That would be a big fuck you for your dice if there was just a zero on there. It's like you don't even get to try.
Dungeon Master 01:30:38 Yeah, that'd be awful. Up next is gonna be Cyrus. Make it quick. He's gonna bonus action give a bardic to Kaladin. As he walks away, he just goes, oh, it hurt them, I guess. And he will
Cletus Cobbington 01:30:58 The end.
Kaladen Shash 01:31:03 What's what is that a 1D8 or 6 right now 1D8? Cool. I can use it on anything.
Zariel Torgan 01:31:05 I think it's a D8, level 8.
Dungeon Master 01:31:11 Um, I think it's... D... it is a D8, yes. He only has... Yeah, pretty much. He only has 30 feet of movement, so he was... He can get to, like, right behind... Leopold. And... True Strike is just on his next attack.
Dungeon Master 01:31:43 So he will, you know, for some reason he doesn't have any sort of crossbow in his inventory, so he'll do just a, he doesn't have a lot of tax bills either. He legit can't do shit.
Cletus Cobbington 01:31:51 2.5 cm x 5 cm
Kaladen Shash 01:31:51 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:32:13 He will use his action then to dash. And he will get into a flanking position. But that is all he can do. He's got no ranged weapon and no ranged attack. Kaladin, you are up next.
Zariel Torgan 01:32:13 You're a wreck.
Cletus Cobbington 01:32:28 Bye!
Kaladen Shash 01:32:31 I'm not going to have enough movement to get super close to a lot of the fighting, so I'm going to go ahead and. I'm going to cast. Uh, this object blast at the one that they're surrounding right now. It's got reverse like this. At this gentleman. First ones at 25 to hit.
Zariel Torgan 01:32:42 I want to say that.
Dungeon Master 01:32:55 Okay. 25 obviously hits. Double miss. 24 hits.
Kaladen Shash 01:33:03 Second one is going to miss with a 12. Hard one, so yeah, so we got a 2D10 coming here. Let me get back to the rolls. Oh, it was almost really good. OK, 9. And then with my action, I'm going to go ahead and cast.
Cletus Cobbington 01:33:07 Thank you for watching.
Dungeon Master 01:33:27 I Okay
Kaladen Shash 01:33:34 Mirror image. And I will. Move 30 feet. Forward, I'm going to flank on this. I can get almost to melee range. It looks like.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:37 Nice. Was there, was there a, I wasn't paying attention on the shillelagh. I just remembered we have bless up. So I don't know if Cletus, but if that would help.
Cletus Cobbington 01:33:52 Bye!
Kaladen Shash 01:34:04 Cletus was not one of the three. There's Leopold, Cyrus, and myself. God bless you all. Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:34:09 Oh, gotcha. Okay, nevermind. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:34:16 Could I end your turn, sir? At the end of your turn, the Elder Brain is going to use a legendary action. And it will use Break Concentration. The Elder Brain targets one creature within 120 feet of it. It has a psychic link.
Kaladen Shash 01:34:39 or support.
Dungeon Master 01:34:45 The Elder Brain has a Psychic Leak with you because you failed your Charisma save. The Elder Brain breaks the creature's concentration on a spell it has cast. The creature also takes 1d4 Psychic Damage per level of the spell that you had cast. So, Polymorph is a level 4? Yeah? Okay, so he breaks your concentration on Polymorph.
Zariel Torgan 01:34:49 For me. The cantrip. Yeah, it's a little before. Terrible.
Dungeon Master 01:35:12 And you take half of 44. You take four points of psychic damage.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:20 Alright, so uh... Okay. Alright, so four bear damage. Okay. Alright, I'm still up.
Dungeon Master 01:35:42 OK. And that is that. At the end, it takes it to this guy who is left. He is pretty quickly surrounded on all fronts. The monkey just turned into a giant robot. He's going to freak out. He got taller, actually. He will do a tentacle attack on you. It's a plus seven to hit.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:58 Got bigger. Are you hitting me?
Dungeon Master 01:36:18 Ooh, 11 does not hit, does it? It doesn't hit any of you, but it was against Leopold. No, it doesn't. It wouldn't hit anything on a good day. After that, it's the Mind Flayer that you already killed, so back up to the top. Initiative 22 is Zariel.
Leopold Magnus 01:36:26 Yeah, who is it on me or Zaria? Yeah, definitely.
Zariel Torgan 01:36:40 What can I do as Scrappled? Can I still make attacks?
Kaladen Shash 01:36:41 Anything but blue?
Dungeon Master 01:36:48 You are grappled, but still a bear. What you can do... Oh, you start the round by taking 1d8 plus 5 psychic damage until the grapple ends. The Elder Brain can have up to a certain number of targets grappled at a time.
Dungeon Master 01:37:24 You can try to use your action to end the grapple. Otherwise, you can still attack it. Anything other than the tentacle would have disadvantage, but attacking the tentacle is normal. It would be to try to break the grapple, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:29 Okay, now let go. Is there any chance that attacking the tentacle might make it drop me? Or do I need to just take my action to not do damage and instead try to break free? Okay, so yeah, I'll try to break the grapple.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:55 Not going to do any good if I'm dead. Would that just be strength or would that be? Okay. Well, that's a natural one.
Dungeon Master 01:38:01 Yeah, give me a strength check. Will do against it's intelligent. No, oppose strength. I think that makes sense. It's got. Maybe got an extra one. Did not matter. Now the natural one you try to struggle, you use. I'll say one of your attack actions is wasted trying to break the grapple.
Kaladen Shash 01:38:14 Does not matter.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:30 All right, so I can make another attack. I don't have another shot to get out, do I? Shit, yeah. Yeah, I'll try to get out. This is dumb. I shouldn't do this. 30, 20. I want to break free.
Dungeon Master 01:38:37 You can try to get out again, but you just wouldn't have another attack. That is an 18.
Leopold Magnus 01:38:39 at the bottom of it.
Kaladen Shash 01:38:52 For free. Yes. Yes.
Zariel Torgan 01:39:04 I'm going to say, suck on that, big brain. And then, well, I say, well, back where I come from, we have a saying for folk like you. And I don't say what the saying is. Let's see. I kind of want to go after one of those pillar guys. So I've used my action, correct?
Dungeon Master 01:39:07 OK. Is that what you said? Yes. Yeah, movement and bonus.
Zariel Torgan 01:39:35 Okay, so all I've left is movement. Okay, so I'm just gonna go, yeah, 40 feet. I'm just gonna take off towards the sky. And I don't have any bonus action economy, even in my normal form. So I'll just take off from it. On me?
Cletus Cobbington 01:39:43 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:39:56 Okay. Okay. At the end of your turn, it's going to spend two legendary actions to make a tentacle attack on you. Yes, sir. You're right. It doesn't like you, but you're also, you're also getting close to something. 18 to hit. Okay. You take, um,
Zariel Torgan 01:40:06 It doesn't like me, see I'm squirrely. Oh yeah, my AC is like 12. God damn.
Cletus Cobbington 01:40:12 He's just a bear.
Dungeon Master 01:40:26 21 points of damage and 1d8 plus 5 psychic that's halved. 5 points of psychic damage. And you are grappled.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:38 All right. Well then, I am now... I took six points of damage as Zariel, and I am no longer a bear. Do I slip out of his grasp when I shrink down to my Zariel size?
Kaladen Shash 01:40:42 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:40:58 Where did I put you proper? Roll D20.
Cletus Cobbington 01:41:10 I think that's a fair point. The fairest maiden of them all.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:15 I'm just a greasy robot, just like a real slick boy. Oh, I love that you're letting me try this. Don't let anybody tell you you're not fair. 15? Oh yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:41:34 Yeah, 100%. You slide out the bottom. The tentacle clenches tight over your head as you hit the ground. You are not grappled. Leopold, it is your go, man.
Cletus Cobbington 01:41:43 Damn.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:46 I just shake my little robot butt at him. Hey, you and me both, you were a monkey and I was a bear and now we're neither.
Leopold Magnus 01:41:51 Oh, Zerio, were you reborn over there or what? Shout out like a new baby. Let's see here.
Dungeon Master 01:42:03 Ace Ventura style. That's what you got. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:17 Officials.
Leopold Magnus 01:42:22 I just reappeared, or reformed as Leopold, regaining my mental faculties. And I'm really, really just kind of out of it. Whoa, Jesus. Zion, you really did me up one. Oh, oh. Spotting the mind flare in front of me.
Leopold Magnus 01:42:45 And I'm going to maybe turn my lightsaber on in Athene, Temidness, and take a really powerful swing at him when he's not expecting it. Oh, with advantage. Good. Let's see what it looks like with advantage. Oh, OK. Yeah, that's not a 20, but yeah, 30-20. So he'll take...
Dungeon Master 01:42:54 OK, we'll do attack with advantage. 16 still hit, but. 3020 also hit.
Leopold Magnus 01:43:11 Three, let's see, more than that, because it's got nine damage there, and then the fire damage for another three. So he'll take 12 on that strike. And then after that confident one, I'm going to kind of swing back around. I'm going to try and hit him right in the gut. 30, 20.
Dungeon Master 01:43:38 20, 20 hits. 10 more damage. Looking very hurt. I thought he died.
Leopold Magnus 01:43:41 Nice. Take 10 more damage plus the fire. He'll take 15 more damage. And then with that, I will use my bonus action to command, because Bone Crusher is still hanging out. He's good for a full day, basically. Oh, did he die? Oh, yes. That's right. He did die. Good point. Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:56 Silence.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:11 So I can't recreate him until I take a long rest and we haven't done that. So for a bonus action, I will pull up my magic stones. And that's my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:44:22 Okay. Magic stones are active. After your turn, the Elder Brain is gonna go... First thing it does is it takes damage at the start of its turn. Okay. Is it another save or is it just damage?
Cletus Cobbington 01:44:39 Yep. Oh. I guess that cues me, huh? Uh, let me look. It just says... When a creature enters spell area for the first time or starts its turn there, it's engulfed in flames. Must cause a constitution saving throw. So every time it has a save. Throw bad! Full damage!
Zariel Torgan 01:44:49 No. No.
Dungeon Master 01:44:58 Oh, sorry. Come on, roll good. An eight. Jesus. With a hit as heavy as that, give me a perception check.
Cletus Cobbington 01:45:15 Twenty-two rating. Yeah. Perception, he said. Twenty-five.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:25 What, okay, does that just happen? Is that part of Moonbeam? That's fucking badass. That's like Witchbolt, but better. Wait.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:37 Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:45:40 25. You see that as it is starting its turn in this beam of radiant moon light that is just streaming down out of nowhere, almost from just the ceiling and beyond, it hits the shield before it seems to hit the brain. And what you notice is that this sort of mind flare up in the top corner on the left, it's taken damage.
Dungeon Master 01:46:11 it is seemingly like flinching and crunching down and seems to almost you see like it's squid fishy type skin boil for no reason and the other brain does not look like it is being hurt.
Cletus Cobbington 01:46:11 I see. The beams hurtin' the chained, the chained squiddies.
Kaladen Shash 01:46:30 Get rid of the buff. Passing the damage. Eliminate them both or hurt them.
Zariel Torgan 01:46:33 Absolutely.
Cletus Cobbington 01:46:42 All right.
Dungeon Master 01:46:45 And then it'll use its movement to go back into over the pool to get out of the moonbeam. And it will. What's it got? How far are you all? I don't want to just pick on Jesse because he's close.
Zariel Torgan 01:47:06 I'm close.
Cletus Cobbington 01:47:13 Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:47:20 OK. It'll move. This is just a pure luck check. I'm just going to roll it. 11 or higher. And it goes after Travis for being closest. And it's going to do its mind blast on him, which is,
Kaladen Shash 01:47:45 Did you get any sort of superior resistance with this little choker?
Dungeon Master 01:47:49 Well, that's the thing. Must succeed on a DC 18. Intelligence saving throw or take a certain number of psychic damage and be stunned for one minute. Travis is immune to... No, he's just resistant. I don't know if I gave him immunity. This will be huge if not. He is resistant. Okay. So he still has to make the save. At least it's not you guys.
Zariel Torgan 01:47:53 Bye.
Kaladen Shash 01:48:16 He gets a plus T4 on his save. Oh, not going to help.
Cletus Cobbington 01:48:20 Let the choker prevail! It did not prevail. Jesus.
Dungeon Master 01:48:24 He rolled a natural two. Oh, as he gets hit with this. He takes 30 points of psychic damage that's pre-rolled, reduced to 15, and he is stunned for one minute.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:33 Oh, he definitely choked on that one.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:33 Interesting.
Kaladen Shash 01:48:55 Unless someone interacts with him or. So no, it has. That's the only way out. No damage taken, just. OK.
Dungeon Master 01:48:55 Let me keep reading, yeah. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. Just got to repeat at the end. And then it doesn't have a ton of action economy, so it does that and that ends its turn at the
Dungeon Master 01:49:22 End of its turn, you see it's this illithid up the corner that seems to be taking the damage. It sort of braces itself back onto its, like, legs and its hand in the crouching position, and it focuses up, and you see a surge of energy go from it to the Elder Brain, refreshing the connection. And that is all it does on its turn. Up after that is the Satyr group.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:43 Thank you very much.
Cletus Cobbington 01:49:48 Uh, I'm gonna have them shoot at that fucker again on the left. That's... Forty twenties... Oh, I did not do that right. Uh, plus five.
Dungeon Master 01:50:08 It's OK. How much is it to each one of them? So 7 plus 15. 7 plus 5 misses because it's not 15, which is the AC. 5 plus 5 misses. 12 plus 5 hits. And then 4 plus 5 misses. So 1 hit.
Kaladen Shash 01:50:08 Yep.
Cletus Cobbington 01:50:26 1 hit, so that's just... 1d6 plus 3 then. Little 8 named. Alright, uh...
Dungeon Master 01:50:43 Eight points of damage. It's looking pretty hurt. After that, before, got anything else? Okay. And then after their turn, but before your turn, you see,
Cletus Cobbington 01:50:59 Tack för idag!
Dungeon Master 01:51:10 The elder brain will take a legendary action. You are. 120 feet from it. Correct. Yes, but just. It'll use a legendary action to break concentration on you. You drop concentration on conjured woodland beings. And you take.
Cletus Cobbington 01:51:38 Oh. Black goats. Yeah, fourth level. Oof.
Dungeon Master 01:51:43 1d4 psychic damage. Ooh, how much, uh, first level spell level? What, was that a level four? Was that your big one? Okay, you take half of this. You take four points of psychic damage. And then it is your turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:56 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:52:08 Alright, um... Hmm. My goatee's be gone. Let's see. Um, in that case... You know what? Fuck you and your cancel concentration. I'm gonna cast a fourth level moonbeam on this...
Kaladen Shash 01:52:14 Boom.
Dungeon Master 01:52:36 Oh. The one over here. Nice. Yeah, he's looking real hard.
Cletus Cobbington 01:52:37 On the right side, calling dude. Get some damage going on him. Yeah. The guy on the left is looking pretty fucked up, eh? You know what, I'll put it on the left side. But still at 4th level.
Kaladen Shash 01:53:03 How wide is the beam? Most and only occupies. No gap.
Cletus Cobbington 01:53:07 5ft, I think. Yeah, 5ft. It's 40ft high. 5ft radius. Can it hit? It can't. Oh, I guess I can barely hit the other one, can't I? It looks like it's 5ft. I want to put it, like, to where it's hitting both of those. Closer to the column. Yeah. 15.
Dungeon Master 01:53:22 Yeah. Okay, and that's concepts from both of them. First one up, gets a four. Second one gets a,
Cletus Cobbington 01:53:43 Let's go! Nice. Alright, 4D10 coming in. 25 to both. Fuck you, battery boy.
Dungeon Master 01:53:52 Believe it or not, that is another four. 25. Finish the first one. The psionic battery is what it is called. And 25 to that guy right there.
Cletus Cobbington 01:54:16 Um.
Leopold Magnus 01:54:20 They don't have blood boys here, they have battery boys.
Dungeon Master 01:54:24 Battery voice. That's one that hurts. That one, I think I went to every single one that wasn't it. OK, anything else on your turn?
Cletus Cobbington 01:54:46 Yeah, use my movement, get like up close with Leopold. Just a little behind him, but closer up to everything. Just use the 30 feet.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:49 Turn it off.
Dungeon Master 01:54:58 Okay. Just about there. After that, it is Cyrus. He will... He'll use his... Well, he already has advantage. That makes his only thing he did with True Strike completely worthless, but he'll take his attack.
Dungeon Master 01:55:22 And he will do a defensive flourish. So he'll do the d6 plus the d8 plus a d8. He gets a 26 to hit. And he does.
Kaladen Shash 01:55:28 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:55:57 He has 18 points of damage and his AC goes up by... Okay. He'll take another attack, still at advantage. Oh, that was just a normal roll. Let's see if he crits.
Kaladen Shash 01:56:12 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:56:26 In fact, no, it's a natural one, so it hits at the 22. He does 14 points of damage, and then he does a d6 of force damage. All this together, he does 19 more points of damage.
Dungeon Master 01:56:57 Nice, okay, and then after that, oh, it's still me going. Yeah, it's this guy right here who had, oh, he had seven HP, he's dead. He will then use his movement. Do you want Travis's character towards the elder brain or towards the mind flayers?
Kaladen Shash 01:56:58 Is that who is he attacking right then the mind player right in front of us? Is he not down? Yeah, it's gonna say he's gotta be down.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:26 I want him to try to bear hug that brain. I mean, you know, it. Yeah, I mean, that wouldn't be bad. I could use some backup.
Dungeon Master 01:57:34 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:57:37 I mean, it might help to go and have him go right with you and try and get that column on the right. Just get those, the damage stallers out of the way just so we can actually start hurting the flare or the brain.
Kaladen Shash 01:57:56 What's the advantage in staying within 10 feet of him right now? I was just asking, what was the advantage of staying within 10 feet of him right now? All right, so we still keep the psychic resistance damage. All right, cool, cool, cool. All right, sweet.
Dungeon Master 01:58:04 Oh, what was that? No, you just get it. Yeah, that is, it is just there. Doesn't require concentration, just lasts for a minute.
Dungeon Master 01:58:32 What is the range on this? 60 feet. This Mind Flayer that already took damage is going to use its movement. Oh yeah, it's a Boon Beam, so he's going to take more damage, probably. If I could roll anything, that'd be fine, but that's a 9.
Cletus Cobbington 01:58:41 Is it the one up by the column that got hit last turn? Let's take another save. Another 4d10. Oh shit, 27. Damn.
Zariel Torgan 01:58:58 Mm-hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:59:02 Moonbeam!
Dungeon Master 01:59:03 Oh, good hit, okay. Hurt, not dead. Green to orange. How close are you to him? Fuck you for that. You see this illithid flies forward and he's going to attempt to cast Dominate Monster on Cletus.
Cletus Cobbington 01:59:23 No. Is that a saving throw? I'm just a humble cow foe. 14.
Zariel Torgan 01:59:27 Does it help that Cletus isn't a monster?
Dungeon Master 01:59:31 Yeah, monster's more encompassing. It is, you attempt to buy Guile, a creature in range. Give me a wisdom saving throw or be charmed for the duration. Ooh, what is the DC? It is DC 15.
Kaladen Shash 01:59:54 You're good. What is it you see? Oh.
Cletus Cobbington 02:00:01 No! What do you mean by that? Yeah, I would love to. I would love to succeed, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:00:03 So close. Oh, yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:00:04 Cletus, would you like to push yourself a little bit further to succeed? I'm asking you as a character. It'd be bad if you got charmed right now. Would you like to instead succeed?
Dungeon Master 02:00:30 Okay, go ahead and give me the role with advantage instead. Get one more chance. 17. It's brand new. Cletus, you feel for a second, your whole consciousness begins to shut down. It's forced off from in the center of your brain. Something is trying to shut off all your synapses.
Cletus Cobbington 02:00:40 Oh, wow. Chan. Oh. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:00:40 It would be funny if nobody else had done this before. We're just telling them to do it anyway.
Kaladen Shash 02:00:44 Yeah, right. What what?
Dungeon Master 02:00:58 Chip slaps you across the cheek when you say that, and you snap, too. Anywhere in your character sheet, go ahead and write down one stress point. Chip gives you a reassuring grab. And that is all this mind flayer does.
Cletus Cobbington 02:01:11 I channel my happy place. Good ol' glass of almond milk on my almond farm. Stress point. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:01:30 At the end of that, let's see, what will I do? We're going to use a legendary action. It'll do psychic pulse. It'll target one creature within 120 feet of it, which has a psychic link to target the enemies. Hold on.
Zariel Torgan 02:01:59 Amp. 3D4.
Dungeon Master 02:02:01 The Elder Brain targets one creature within 120 feet of it, which it has a psychic link. The target and enemies of the Elder Brain within 30 feet of target take 3d6 psychic damage. So emanating from Leopold, centered around him, everybody's going to take 3d6 psychic damage.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:14 866. Yeah. OK.
Cletus Cobbington 02:02:25 I regret that I didn't make it to the first part. So, three of us here.
Dungeon Master 02:02:29 But you are all resistant, so you take half anyway. 13 half, you take 6.
Leopold Magnus 02:02:33 I don't know. Is that for people within the range of the circlet? OK. Oh, six damage. Got it.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:36 Bye.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:41 That's just us, yeah, the three of us right there. Taken, six damage taken.
Dungeon Master 02:02:51 And then after that it is Kaladin. Oh, sorry. After that it is the first psionic battery's turn. This one up here who you have seen hasn't done anything yet with the death of its compatriot will double down and you see a pulse emanate from it to the elder brain and it does that for its turn. Then it is Kaladin.
Kaladen Shash 02:03:15 Uh. I'll use my turn. I'm gonna just attack. That mind player that's working towards this.
Dungeon Master 02:03:37 Okay, go ahead and roll the hit. 17 hits. 15 does hit. 15 exactly.
Kaladen Shash 02:03:44 This will be a plus 4 if needed. Does 17 hit? Does 15 hit? All right, sweet.
Cletus Cobbington 02:03:53 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:04:08 16 hits. And on death's door, but just not quite dead. Soft roll.
Kaladen Shash 02:04:20 for 10 10 damage Soft roller I'm gonna go ahead and I'm just gonna snap. I'm just use my movement to separate a little bit here
Zariel Torgan 02:04:39 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:04:44 Out to the side. Okay, anything else on your term? Okay. That's a dead mind flare. That is... What the hell is this?
Kaladen Shash 02:04:50 That's going to be it.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:11 All right, let's see how far I can get. About there.
Dungeon Master 02:05:16 That's the one that hasn't gone yet. Okay. No, it's not. That guy is dead. Okay, it's just back up to the top. That's everybody actually. Huge initiative order. Up at the top it is Zariel. You are grappled. Oh, you slid out. That's right.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:44 Oh, I thought he'd, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that was very kind of you to let me do that. How high up in the air are these guys? OK, so I can get over to the base, but I can't really get much higher. Let's see. I want to check something here.
Kaladen Shash 02:05:45 worked out.
Cletus Cobbington 02:05:46 😍😍
Dungeon Master 02:05:48 Good roll on that. I think it made 10. 35 feet.
Zariel Torgan 02:06:14 I just want to check what this does real quick. No, that's not what I want to do. OK. I'm going to cast, are they wearing anything metal? Like the chain that's wrapped around them, is that metal?
Leopold Magnus 02:06:27 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:06:40 They have a breastplate that is made of metal.
Zariel Torgan 02:06:42 All right, I'm going to cast Heat Metal at a second level. No, you know what? Let's do third level Heat Metal. And let's see, make sure I got it right here. So it says, if a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes damage from it, the creature must succeed on a con, saving throw, or drop the object if it can.
Cletus Cobbington 02:06:47 Cool. Hell yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:06:48 You.
Zariel Torgan 02:07:11 So it just happens. The save is just to see if they can get the thing off of them. I don't perceive this thing as something that they can take off or can they take it off.
Dungeon Master 02:07:14 Mm-hmm. It looks like, let me send it to game log. It is like it could doff it if it wanted to. It could take it off in theory, but it wouldn't be an instant action. It is not like a heavy piece of,
Zariel Torgan 02:07:40 OK, well, then it's going to take. OK, is the chain that's wrapped around it, is that something that's metal as well?
Dungeon Master 02:07:44 armor but it is present. Now you're this close you see that that is not a chain that is attached to it is just like this little thing on the ground they hold on to it almost looks more ritualistic than anything. But it is not like it is not manacle.
Cletus Cobbington 02:07:47 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:08:11 Gotcha. Do I get the impression that they don't really have to carry the chain to do the thing that they want to do? What kind of check would you like? Oh, Jesus. That's going to be a minus one. Oh, and that's a plus one. That's a natural 20.
Dungeon Master 02:08:18 Um, I think that would require a check. Like an arcana check. Natural 20. Um, you think there is something very special.
Kaladen Shash 02:08:27 Yep.
Cletus Cobbington 02:08:28 😁😁😁
Dungeon Master 02:08:43 about these pillars being designed in the way they are, you do think that it requires holding that chain to do this thing. And you do know that while it is sort of channeling its life force towards the Elder Brain, the Elder Brain is not taking any damage of it. Having these Illithids spend their action giving their life self to it is granting it sort of like invulnerability.
Leopold Magnus 02:08:56 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:09:13 So you guys have the right instinct and that you have to deal with this. Well.
Zariel Torgan 02:09:13 Do I get the impression, and I'm just asking because I got a natural 20 and I want to push it. Do I get the impression that heat metal might work to hurt this thing, but my energy would be better served trying to destroy this chain versus just trying to hurt the guy? Because if the guy drops the chain,
Cletus Cobbington 02:09:29 End.
Dungeon Master 02:09:42 with a natural 20, again, the chain is more attached to the pillar, like this room has significance and that position has significance. It'll probably have to use its action to start to take off the armor somehow. It'll have to try to figure out something. So it won't be able to contribute while it's dealing with that. If you wanted to permanently disable the pillar, you would probably need to go after the chain.
Zariel Torgan 02:09:44 Mhm. Mhm. Okay, um.
Dungeon Master 02:10:10 So temporary inconvenience versus permanent.
Zariel Torgan 02:10:13 Yeah, so let me see what I got. So... Hmm... Would I be able to retool Heat Metal? I know it wouldn't work, like, strictly rules-wise. But, uh... Could I focus my Heat Metal on the chain instead? And try to make it take the damage? I don't really have a lot of damage doing spells. Gotcha.
Cletus Cobbington 02:10:14 Thank you for watching.
Dungeon Master 02:10:38 The chains don't have an HP, mechanically. Like, you could try to break the whole thing, which has a threshold, but, like, heat metal doesn't melt metal, so there wouldn't be no, like, ticking damage on it.
Zariel Torgan 02:10:45 Mm-hmm. Yeah. OK. I don't really have something that would. Hmm. All right. Well, I'll quit taking too much time here. I'll just figure out what I want to do.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:10 Hmm, does it have to grab the chain in order to send stuff through it? Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 02:11:11 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:11:17 Yeah, it seems like it, like part of the thing is being in that crouch position, holding it and doing something to give it life force.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:24 Alright, well then I'm gonna do Heat Metal on the chain just to... I know it's not gonna weaken it, but Zariel thinks it might do something. And also it'll burn the guy, so he'll have to drop it. And it just stays hot as long as I concentrate on it. So he'll take 3d8 fire damage until he drops it. And every time he wants to grab it, he's gonna take 3d8 fire damage. Yeah, I think it says...
Dungeon Master 02:11:48 OK, does he do it right when it happens or at the start of his turn?
Zariel Torgan 02:11:56 Let's see. It just says if a creature is holding it, it takes damage. And then if it doesn't drop the object until the start of its next turn, then it takes damage again on its next turn. So.
Zariel Torgan 02:12:16 I think that it takes damage now, and then if it doesn't drop it now, because it gets to roll, Constitution Saving Throw, this, yeah, and so it takes damage now, and then if it rolls and fails, it will take damage again on its turn. Okay. So that's, that's eight damage. All right.
Kaladen Shash 02:12:18 Thank you very much.
Dungeon Master 02:12:22 And it's a con save here. It's a dirty 20 on the con save. Sandwich is damaged.
Cletus Cobbington 02:12:25 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:12:45 And so he can drop it if he wants after this, but he'll have to pick it up to do something. I think you take damage regardless. I think the con save is just to be able to drop it quick enough for the next one. But let me double check. No, no, there's no extra penalty.
Dungeon Master 02:12:53 And he only takes damage on the start of his turn, right? Yeah. But like, if he's holding it throughout, there's no extra penalty. You see he doesn't let go of it. Like, he is determined to sort of give his body for this creature.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:22 Okay. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:13:22 You see his hands are literally smoking off of holding the chains. But since he passed his check, he is continuing to hold on. After your turn, since it's not a problem yet, the brain won't do anything because they can't spend two. So after your turn, it is Leopold.
Kaladen Shash 02:13:42 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 02:13:49 Awesome. Yeah, lots of work has been done on the field here since I last attacked. So let's see. I'm going to move 30 feet to here. Nice. Final battle. And with my...
Leopold Magnus 02:14:19 Action I'm gonna use a ranged attack 120 feet so I think I should be alright with the fireball. Oh Yeah easily I'm gonna aim a fireball at the At the mind flare up on top of this pillar that we've been hearing So I'll roll the hit
Zariel Torgan 02:14:23 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:14:38 Great balls of fire!
Dungeon Master 02:14:43 Go for it. I'm just gonna hit. 16 damage, nice. Jesus. Take it somewhere and tear.
Leopold Magnus 02:14:46 Yeah, buddy. So that's 27. And it's 2d10, Lermariad. 16 damage. So that's my action. And then for my bonus action, I will hurdle a magic stone at it. Let me...
Dungeon Master 02:15:15 in your aim range for a magic retell. It is farther than 60. To the ground, you're 70, and then he's 35 feet in the air. So I don't know. I'm not going to calculate that. I don't know where he's going to be.
Leopold Magnus 02:15:18 Yeah, let me double check on that. Where's the range? 60 feet. How far am I? I think I was pretty close to that. Okay, yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. So I'm out of range, but I am within range of this one, right? Or is he, he's not dead.
Zariel Torgan 02:15:24 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:15:30 70.
Dungeon Master 02:15:50 Which one? The one. There. Yeah, I'm gonna say he's got half cover because this is a staircase that goes up. So you see like the top of his head before like it's just staircase guarding him. Get up. The brain is floating in the air. But within distance. Yeah, I'm gonna say like 15 feet up off the the Brian pool.
Leopold Magnus 02:15:52 That one there? Yeah. Okay. And the brain. How high? Okay, it's within distance. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 02:16:12 Hit the brain. Yeah, it's going to work on the pillar boy anyway, so it works.
Leopold Magnus 02:16:21 Then I'll target the brain. Fuck. 10. That's so big. Oh, yeah, I don't know if that matters, but I'll roll a d4, yeah, see what happens. Hey, 14 hit. Damn it.
Dungeon Master 02:16:29 10 does not hit. 40 does not hit.
Kaladen Shash 02:16:32 Plus four, plus four, plus D4, D4, all those things. There you go, everything. It's okay, it's okay. I do.
Zariel Torgan 02:16:40 Who ended up? Nice. Oh. Who had that inspiration? Was that Kaladin or? Oh, OK.
Cletus Cobbington 02:16:47 Ugh.
Leopold Magnus 02:16:51 Okay, so that was my attack, movement, and bonus action.
Dungeon Master 02:17:02 OK. After your turn, it'll be the Elder Brain's turn. It's going to be pretty pissed about the whole Zariel, Leopold thing. So it will go in the air, skirting. There's still a Moonbeam, technically, right here, right? Where is the Moonbeam now? There's just one over here. Gotcha. So there's not one right in front of it.
Kaladen Shash 02:17:24 which is the one.
Dungeon Master 02:17:29 That's what I almost it will move this way floating through the air And then on its turn it gets a We'll see if it recharges its mind blast Does not I roll real shit for you guys I
Zariel Torgan 02:17:53 We appreciate it. Oh, sorry. I just remembered that does my shield. Um, I, well, nevermind. I never rolled successfully against the elephant, so nevermind.
Dungeon Master 02:17:56 You're welcome. You'll do a tentacle attack on. Let's pick on somebody new on Leopold. That's right, you didn't. Yeah, 12 to hit.
Leopold Magnus 02:18:19 You rolled a 12. 12 does not hit.
Zariel Torgan 02:18:26 Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:18:26 Cool. Great. Good use of a term. After that, it is Cletus. He's actually a little bit closer because he was going to hit Leopold.
Kaladen Shash 02:18:29 Nope.
Cletus Cobbington 02:18:33 Cletus, um, alright. Uh... Oh shit, you moved. Let's see, is that within... Oh, perfect. Um, I'm gonna use my action to shift moon.
Cletus Cobbington 02:18:59 Still works. I'm gonna move Moonbeam back on from the left pillar to the big brain. Try to get that damage on the right pillar. So that'll enter it for the first time, so he'll need to use his wisdom save and throw again.
Dungeon Master 02:19:02 Yeah. A wisdom save for Moonbeam?
Dungeon Master 02:19:31 Or con save. Oh, you're good. That'll be 10, which is a failure. OK. Oof. Looking really hurt.
Cletus Cobbington 02:19:31 Oh, can't save, my bad. 4G10 again. 26. Looking really hurt.
Cletus Cobbington 02:20:02 I don't know if there's anything else I can really do here. I'll use my movement to get closer to the guy on the left.
Dungeon Master 02:20:30 All right, all right. You should be able just to grab and click and grab.
Cletus Cobbington 02:20:33 What? I don't know how to move him, but I'll move him to the 30 feet to the left on towards that mine flare. Just to get proactive somewhere else. Oh, there you go, OK. I was locked into the ruler. That's what was going on.
Dungeon Master 02:21:02 Uh, okay. Okay. After your turn, the Liberian is going to use two legendary actions and make a tentacle attack on Zariel because he's easier to hit. With a natural one. Ugh. Misses. Cyrus's turn.
Cletus Cobbington 02:21:04 Yep, that's it. How does he know?
Zariel Torgan 02:21:16 But... Mr...
Leopold Magnus 02:21:30 Hate to see it.
Dungeon Master 02:21:33 Cyrus will call out to Cletus and just goes, oh, you can't pay me if you're dead. And he like points his thumb up really crookedly, like a really bad thumbs up. And he'll give you a bardic. And then he will
Cletus Cobbington 02:21:55 Okay. Thank you, Almond Boy.
Dungeon Master 02:22:06 You bet. That's what I'm here for. Um. Nothing, he won't waste any spells on. Something that's not going to be effective. He will use his movement to go. He's going to go around a little bit. He's not going to go towards the brain. Gets behind the pillar.
Dungeon Master 02:22:37 Up neck. Is this real hurt fucker up here? He's looking frantic. He's going to close the distance with Euclidus. And he's going to attempt to latch onto your face. Can I hit? Oh. 26 to hit.
Dungeon Master 02:23:14 that probably hits. Yeah, Cletus. I didn't knock my thing cut out. You take 15 points of psychic damage halved to 7, and you are grappled.
Cletus Cobbington 02:23:23 Sorry, did you say Cletus? Oh yeah. No, that breaks my fucking mood beam.
Dungeon Master 02:23:45 Roll a concentration check. Doesn't just break it. 15, the damage is half the total damage or 10, whichever is higher. So you took 10 was the DC, so 15 passes. Moonbeam is there.
Cletus Cobbington 02:23:58 Fifteen. Oh, nice.
Dungeon Master 02:24:15 And then up next is going to be the Psionic Battery. He will use his action to maintain the shield. But he takes fire damage at the start of his turn. And he makes a concept, correct? What if he...
Zariel Torgan 02:24:33 Yeah, but the con save is just to drop it if he wants to. If he's never gonna drop it, then he never takes the damage. I mean, sorry, then he just takes the damage. No, it says, um... Oh yeah, I guess it says, uh, the creature must... so, let's see.
Kaladen Shash 02:24:43 proper view trail.
Dungeon Master 02:24:43 If he fails, then he has to drop it, right? If they choose to succeed, they can do it. OK.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:00 If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage, then the creature must exceed a con save throw or drop the object if it can. And so if he fails, not only does he take the damage, he'll then drop the chains. But if he can just pick it up on his turn, then it doesn't really matter. But he'll still take the damage. Yeah. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:25:20 But then he takes the damage again. So he'll take the damage twice. So he takes the damage, he failed his con, he'll take the damage again because he will pick it up because again, he does his action to do it. So it'll be damage, he takes his action, and then he takes damage again. So 17 damage with the first bit.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:32 Oh, gotcha. Okay. Okay. Seven. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:25:51 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:25:52 17, those are crazy different roles. Doesn't matter, it's more than enough. You see as he reaches down and he grabs the chains again, he channels his energy and he lets out what would be a psychic wail, but you guys can't even hear him scream as his body compresses into almost nothing and his entire life force sucks into the brain and he is dead. And you see, well, nothing, but
Dungeon Master 02:26:21 What is no longer there currently is this psychic barrier protecting the elder brain. And after that, it is Kaladin. To the, who are you shooting at?
Kaladen Shash 02:26:33 Yes, I'd like to cast Romantic Orb at second level. The Elder Brain. It was 18 hit. Okay, this will be Thunder damage.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:33 Fuck him up.
Dungeon Master 02:26:57 18 does hit. Doesn't have any immunities or anything. So 19 thunder damage. 30.
Kaladen Shash 02:27:03 Not too bad. I'm going to move 30 feet. If I.
Dungeon Master 02:27:30 Yeah. One's gotta be a cantrip. One's gotta be a spell.
Kaladen Shash 02:27:31 Can I? So that was a spell. If I use a bonus action to cast Misty step, that's the second spell. I can't do that, right? OK. Great. Just making sure. Uhm? OK, so I'm in 30.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:08 OK. And then I think I'll action surge and cast another chromatic orb at second level. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:28:09 Okay. Go ahead and roll the hit, sir.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:37 That's not going to hit. Let's see here, D4. 012 hits. Another 18.
Dungeon Master 02:28:41 Well, you see that without its subservience to give it a bonus, it doesn't seem nearly as hard to hit as it is just a giant floating brain.
Leopold Magnus 02:28:59 That makes a lot more sense.
Dungeon Master 02:29:14 Okay. Anything else, sir? It's going to be pretty pissed about that. It'll use its last legendary action and do Break Concentration on Zariel. Kind of just out of spite.
Kaladen Shash 02:29:20 No, that's it. I just get an extra action, not any bonus action or movement.
Zariel Torgan 02:29:43 Okay. All right. I'm gonna cast at a third level. I'm gonna cast Conjure Animals, and I'm gonna bring eight wolves in.
Dungeon Master 02:29:47 Uh, and then that is it up at the top initiative 22 zariel. It is your turn I freaking hate the eagles. Come on, man
Kaladen Shash 02:30:12 I'm sick.
Zariel Torgan 02:30:13 Wait, wait, sorry, before I do that. The brain's up in the air like a bunch, isn't he? Okay, okay, so I... Gotcha, yeah, yeah, that's not practical. Okay. Hmm. Both guys up there are dead.
Dungeon Master 02:30:20 Yeah. Off of the base floor, he's probably 20 to 30 feet off the air. Off the top of the stairs, he's 10 to 15.
Zariel Torgan 02:30:42 Really don't have a lot I can do. I guess I'll cast... I'll cast Blight.
Dungeon Master 02:31:02 Ooh, tracing with her. Ooh, what's the range on blade?
Zariel Torgan 02:31:11 30 feet, so I'll move up into his space. And let's see. Oh, this doesn't really do as much as I thought it did. I already said I was going to do it. So it's a con save, 16.
Dungeon Master 02:31:36 I'll save of 16. That is a 7. 88 is a lot. What are you talking about? What the fuck is that?
Kaladen Shash 02:31:36 Yeah, what? He's like, oh, oh.
Zariel Torgan 02:31:50 Alright, so he takes 8d8 necrotic damage. Alright.
Cletus Cobbington 02:31:55 That's what I was gonna say. 39 damage, that's not as much. Bro, that's shit damage. Turn back to a bear, that's too much, that's not enough damage.
Dungeon Master 02:32:04 You're power hungry, man. You like doing way too much damage.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:08 I do... Alright, so... And then as a bonus action, let's see... I don't think I can transfer as a bonus. I think that's an action. How's everybody looking healing-wise? Pretty good?
Leopold Magnus 02:32:08 He's just playing it off casual.
Kaladen Shash 02:32:29 We're to do it right now. Just a little psychic damage, otherwise good.
Cletus Cobbington 02:32:29 I think we're all pretty solid, honestly. I was like, what are you talking about?
Zariel Torgan 02:32:36 All right, I'm going to use a, uh, let's see. Oh, I can't cause it was a spell. Nevermind. Uh, yeah, that's all I got. So I'll just. No, that's all I got.
Dungeon Master 02:32:41 I guess I got garbage in my pack. I got nothing good. Ridiculous. Anything else, Zaria? OK. Initiative count 21. Leopold, you are up.
Cletus Cobbington 02:33:06 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:33:17 Hell yeah. So I'm gonna, how far up is the elder brain? You said like 15 feet? Okay, so. Yeah, well, I'm just thinking he's flying out of reach of my sword. So I can't hit him with my sword. Oh, okay.
Dungeon Master 02:33:27 Like yeah, 1520 from. Where are you at? Oh, you're pretty close, yeah? Yeah, you could like run up the stairs and jump up and be in range.
Cletus Cobbington 02:33:45 Thank you for watching.
Leopold Magnus 02:33:49 Yeah, I'll do that. If that's fair. Yeah, it looks like I could get kind of just behind him. Like if I run underneath up these stairs, would that put me in range? Cool. Excellent. So I'll run underneath and I'll say, this brain is freaking me out.
Dungeon Master 02:34:08 Yes, you could jump at that point and be in range. Run up witty one-liner. 15 hit.
Leopold Magnus 02:34:20 And with my swords come slicing into its spongy soft flesh. 15. Wait. 14 damage plus 20 damage on the one strike. Yeah. Hell yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:34:40 Thanks for watching.
Dungeon Master 02:34:44 20 damage. Good hit. Okay, roll second hit. 22 hits.
Leopold Magnus 02:34:47 Uh, so maybe I get a pretty big chunk, one of its tentacles or something, and I come around before I land, but just kind of like clumsily flailing my sword. I'm going to try and hit him again. Oh, that's going to connect. 22. 11 plus. Ah, so not as heavy as the hit, but that'd be 13 more damage on the swords.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:06 Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:35:15 13 more damage. Yeah, you could shoot a stone.
Leopold Magnus 02:35:18 And then I will land below it. And would I take a penalty for shooting a magic stone? Because I'm pretty far away at this point, like 15 feet. Cool. Because I have two up. So yeah, wait. Yeah, I tried to shoot one. I will shoot a stone. 18 to hit.
Cletus Cobbington 02:35:31 Thanks for watching!
Dungeon Master 02:35:48 18 hits. Ooh. After all of that damage, oh, take that!
Leopold Magnus 02:35:50 And max damage, baby. 11 on the stone. Ignored the second one. But that was also 11, which is a shame. Cool. So he takes, or the brain, it takes 11 additional damage from the stone. And I'll sling that, and I'll say, oh, take that! And that is my turn.
Cletus Cobbington 02:36:14 Take that! I'll do it, but also, start of his turn, Mr. Moonbeam. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:36:17 Moonbeams.
Zariel Torgan 02:36:17 Sure.
Dungeon Master 02:36:19 Uh after your turn initiative count 20 somebody roll me that d20 We'll do it we'll do it on his turn this is right before that you guys are so obsessed with damage
Leopold Magnus 02:36:19 Bye-bye.
Cletus Cobbington 02:36:45 Okay, I did not roll amazing. Oh no. Three? I'm just gonna have permanent fucking mind flayers.
Dungeon Master 02:36:50 5 OK, roll me a D4. 3. You see. Two more mind flayers popped out.
Zariel Torgan 02:36:51 you
Dungeon Master 02:37:24 One on each side. What about that moon meme? Okay, and then at the start of the elder brains turn, it takes that damage.
Cletus Cobbington 02:37:26 I'm getting real sick of these calamari fuckers. Fry em up with my moonbeam. Did you roll? Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:37:29 Hmph.
Kaladen Shash 02:37:30 We'll be back.
Leopold Magnus 02:37:33 I tend to agree with you, Cletus. Let's serve him up.
Dungeon Master 02:37:53 Oh, it's a con save, right? Let me get on it. Uh, natural 20. What you got? 28, 14. Jesus. Yeah. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 02:38:05 Damn. So it takes half. Half to 14. Damn, I rolled good too. Moonbeam is fucking annoying.
Dungeon Master 02:38:23 It's showing decent wear and tear. It is not liking it. Yeah, I'm not loving it. On its turn then. We'll see if it gets its mind blast. 3 it does not. It will.
Kaladen Shash 02:38:36 This keeps giving back.
Dungeon Master 02:38:52 Believe it or not, it's not looking great. Okay. Leopold, you were the last one to hit it. Yeah, the moon beam being like the energy field, I'm not gonna count. Leopold, give me a...
Leopold Magnus 02:39:10 Yeah, if you discount the moonbeam. Is Bless still applied here?
Kaladen Shash 02:39:12 Thanks.
Cletus Cobbington 02:39:21 Tipped it, can't count it.
Dungeon Master 02:39:22 Waste and saving. And it'll also move back out of the moonbeam. It was a saving throw.
Kaladen Shash 02:39:40 Yes, stop. Saving throws and attacks, not checks that we actually do check. Yeah, you can add a D4.
Leopold Magnus 02:39:49 Oh, did you ask for a check or a save? Sorry. All right, yeah, 12. Cool, what's the effect of that? Oh, OK.
Dungeon Master 02:39:51 No, it's a saving throw. 12 fails. You are under the effect of Dominate Monster. You will have advantage on this because you're fighting it. You still get the 4 from the d4, but go ahead and just roll another wisdom save.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:02 All right.
Leopold Magnus 02:40:22 Oh, 18. Hell, yes. That would have been really bad.
Dungeon Master 02:40:23 Fourteen. Eighteen. Eighteen passes. You are not dominated. And that is all it can do on its turn. It's the wood hat. Pleadis, you are up, my man.
Kaladen Shash 02:40:35 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 02:40:40 All right. I'm going to prioritize Moonbeam, I think. I want to back up 30 feet. OK. I'm going to back up my 30 feet.
Cletus Cobbington 02:41:05 And then move, use my action to move Moonbeam yet again onto the big brain. Okay, half of this. So, 15. Shit, okay, that was not a great one.
Dungeon Master 02:41:17 Uh, 17. It takes 7 damage.
Cletus Cobbington 02:41:40 And that'll do me. Um, and who's next? Kaladin's next. It's a full action to move it. Um, I don't think anyone... No!
Dungeon Master 02:41:45 Okay. Any bonus action or anything? Or is it a bonus action to move it? Gotcha. After your turn, it'll use a legendary action and do Break Concentration. And it's going to end your concentration on Moonbeam.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:46 Bye.
Cletus Cobbington 02:42:12 Fair enough. There's no save or anything to that, it just does it. Ah, I see.
Dungeon Master 02:42:18 Uh, there is something you guys can do. So you haven't prioritized it because it's a whole thing you have to do. Um, it has put a psychic link, uh, into you guys. It is like attached to self. You can use a full action to try to terminate the link. And it'll take a charisma saving through, but nobody's tried it yet.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:39 Peace.
Cletus Cobbington 02:42:41 I mean, haven't done it yet, so... Can I do it as, like, a reaction to it doing its thing? Right. Okay. Fair enough.
Dungeon Master 02:42:52 It is as an action. OK, and then after your turn, it'll be Cyrus. I think I used all of his. Arctic already. Anybody looking really hurt? All looking good.
Kaladen Shash 02:43:10 Okay. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:43:19 Mm-mm.
Leopold Magnus 02:43:21 No, not really. Yeah, I've only taken six damage.
Cletus Cobbington 02:43:24 I mean, I'm the most hurt, I think, but not necessarily hurt.
Dungeon Master 02:43:31 He will just use his movements. And then I'm going to have him make an insight check. And I'll let you know if he passes what it was for. Not very insightful. OK. He will just use his action to try to close the distance with this one. After him, it will be.
Dungeon Master 02:43:59 Oh, Cletus, you were grappled by this mind flare. That's my bad. I'm gonna say you just drug him with you. You can still do everything you did, unless you would like to try to break it.
Cletus Cobbington 02:44:06 Oh, shit. Yeah, you're right. A man handled him with me. I mean, that's up to you. I mean, if he just came with me, that's fine. But if you want to redo something with that, then that's up to you.
Zariel Torgan 02:44:06 Peace.
Kaladen Shash 02:44:18 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:44:30 Well, I'll leave it up to you because it is an alarming amount of damage if it does it again. So once he has you grappled, he does extract brain, which is another hit that he has to hit to land. But if he lands a hit on you, you will take 10d10 piercing damage. And if it reduces you to zero hit points, you are killed instantly.
Cletus Cobbington 02:44:46 Jesus. Fuckin' hell. Okay, um... To ungrapple, is that like an action? Okay, then I would say like...
Zariel Torgan 02:44:55 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:45:06 Uh, it's like one of your attacks. So if you have two attacks, it'll be one of your, if you only have one attack, it is your full attack. Depends on how many Queens do you have? Okay. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:45:16 put us back to where we were then I didn't move. I still would have been able to move my moonbeam and let me just try to ungrapple I guess, right? So what kind of, is that a deck save or strength? I mean, they're the same.
Dungeon Master 02:45:35 Let me see. It is a post-athletic, I believe. Yeah. Yeah, you're doing like a strength check if you have proficiency in athletics.
Cletus Cobbington 02:45:44 Was that just a FIX check then? Yeah. Okay. Okay, alright, it's the same either way. Hey. Oh fuck.
Dungeon Master 02:46:06 you are still grappled. Now, you would have done that on your turn. So then it would have been Cyrus's turn before this. He was here. Would you convey to the group that
Cletus Cobbington 02:46:13 Cyrus is about to inherit a fuckin' farm.
Kaladen Shash 02:46:17 Hello?
Dungeon Master 02:46:35 you were like in dire straits. Okay, I think that's fair. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:39 Bye.
Cletus Cobbington 02:46:41 I mean, I'm grappled, but I don't know if I would... I definitely wouldn't know that he has that ability. I've never seen these fuckers before. And I haven't used it yet, so... I mean, they know I'm grappled, that's as much as everyone knows, and same here.
Dungeon Master 02:47:00 So then he would have done his turn. It is the Mind Flayer's turn. He's going to try to attack you. If he lands this hit, you're going to take a lot of damage. It is a 16 to hit. Why is your AC only 13? Don't you have any armor on?
Cletus Cobbington 02:47:15 My AC is so, so high. Okay, yeah. Yep. I got, I got hide armor, man. I'm a farmer. I was not prepared to be an adventurer.
Zariel Torgan 02:47:33 Oh, that's not bad.
Dungeon Master 02:47:34 Okay. Okay. You take 45 points of piercing damage. Okay. It doesn't gain hit points by doing this. This is kind of just its last thing. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:47:38 Oh, dear.
Cletus Cobbington 02:47:47 Okay, I'm still up. I'm very, very hurt, but I'm still up. Okay, now I can vape. Guys, I'm fucked up.
Zariel Torgan 02:48:07 Yes, yes.
Dungeon Master 02:48:08 After that, it'll be Kaladin, your go. Blood is exploding everywhere. You're like Arc Blast.
Kaladen Shash 02:48:14 What are my perspectives? Stop kissing the creature, just kill it. I'm. I'm going to go ahead and activate my what it was called on an arc. Slash was still light splitters range. Yeah, what is that? Yeah, arc slash.
Cletus Cobbington 02:48:28 Thank you for watching.
Dungeon Master 02:48:37 You get, I think, 30 feet. Yeah, you can choose to either have range or melee attacks. The one that's got Cletus.
Kaladen Shash 02:48:39 It's just it's 30 feet range and it goes for one minute. The next. Minute I can alternate ranges all. I will. Perform a range text in the slashing arc at. That mine player. Once got clearest.
Dungeon Master 02:49:08 Okay, go ahead and roll your text one at a time. 22 hit. Ooh. Cowden, finish this mind flare that is devouring the brain of Cletus.
Kaladen Shash 02:49:11 It's 22. It's. Flashing plus radiant. 15 total. Uhm, that slashing energy so like I just swing my sword and it emanates a sharp like whipping little mirage through the air and it just.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:30 Nice.
Kaladen Shash 02:49:41 Leaves the top of the mind player's head right off. It just slowly collapses.
Dungeon Master 02:49:47 just a clean swipe, he can manipulate the light as well. So you see, Cletus, this just flash of light scores through the air, almost splitting like your perception of
Dungeon Master 02:50:01 uh like reality just so fast uh and then it doesn't seem to hurt you but then you feel like that the it is like an octopus mouth it's like a ringed toothy maw that is like boring into the back of your head uh it stops and everything goes slack and the tentacles that are wrapped around your like your bovine face just loosen and the head just kind of first hangs and then it drops to the ground
Kaladen Shash 02:50:28 Yes, be more careful. I'm gonna use my 30 feet of movement. I will use, how far away am I?
Dungeon Master 02:50:29 Lunch. Chip looked really offended by that statement.
Cletus Cobbington 02:50:29 Oh, my brain was turning to soup. I get distracted. I got distracted by my pretty, pretty light that was hidden.
Leopold Magnus 02:50:40 I'm pretty sure it was already soup.
Zariel Torgan 02:50:44 with.
Kaladen Shash 02:50:58 I'm 40 feet. I'll use my bonus action. To Misty step another 15 feet so I can just be in range. And I'll take another. Arranged Orcs laugh attack with light splitter. At the elder bread. We had 21 to hit.
Dungeon Master 02:51:17 Go for it. 21 hits. Thanks. I designed the item too. I drew out the blade and everything. I was real stoked about it.
Cletus Cobbington 02:51:24 Lightsplitter is just such a fucking sick name. Damn.
Zariel Torgan 02:51:33 Mm-hmm.
Kaladen Shash 02:51:33 Yeah, it's really fun, does a great idea. Not bad, 18.
Dungeon Master 02:51:43 It's one of those things where you think of, you're like, yeah, this is a good idea. 18 damage. Nice. OK. After your turn, it is which one of the two goes first?
Cletus Cobbington 02:51:56 Peace.
Kaladen Shash 02:52:02 And that's, that's full action turn.
Dungeon Master 02:52:13 The top left one, you see this mind flare, seeing the elder brain getting struck now. It is vulnerable. It is taking damage. It is looking somewhat hurt. It has to use a dash as well, full movement and dash. And it gets the top of this pillar. And it can't do anything else, but you see it leans down into position, getting ready to take over on this position. After that one.
Cletus Cobbington 02:52:31 Hello, everyone. My name is John.
Dungeon Master 02:52:41 this one right here will try to do the same thing but it has to leave Cyrus's face and he will take his attack
Zariel Torgan 02:52:46 Okay, thanks.
Dungeon Master 02:53:00 When he takes the attack option, he's going to use its ability. It has two charges. When he takes the attack with this weapon, he can instant opt to expend one charge to cast Calm Emotions on this creature. He's going to try to make it so with his first attack, with his reaction attack, that he stops it. He's going to try to confuse it.
Zariel Torgan 02:53:26 All right. I would like to cast Conjure Animals.
Dungeon Master 02:53:28 That is a Dirty 20 that hits. So this Mind Flayer is going to use like 10 of its feet of movement, and it's going to hit by him as it goes past. And it's going to stop temporarily soothed and not listening to the Elder Rain. And then up at the top, that is Zariel.
Zariel Torgan 02:53:57 And I would like to cast Eight Giant Bat. It's a CR quarter.
Cletus Cobbington 02:54:01 Click OK.
Dungeon Master 02:54:09 I inspect. OK. Is that the CR quarter or CR zero? I hate they always come in with a border. It's so ridiculous. OK. And then.
Cletus Cobbington 02:54:30 Thank you very much.
Dungeon Master 02:54:42 How are you positioning them? You fit a lot of them.
Zariel Torgan 02:54:44 uh, completely surrounding, um, I'd like four of them around the Elder Brain and four of them around the guy on the pillar over there. Actually, do you think I could fit all of them around the Elder Brain? All right. I'll do six of them there. And then the
Kaladen Shash 02:55:00 All right.
Dungeon Master 02:55:12 And then in theory, one above and one below. Unless you want the other to be somewhere else. You got it.
Zariel Torgan 02:55:17 I'm just trying to... Yeah, can I take the other two over to this guy over here? One on either side. Alright. And then, um... Do they just go now that I've cast them, or... Let me see.
Dungeon Master 02:55:45 A role initiative from the same thing as the. The Cedars, the role in a group initiative. So go ahead and roll me one initiative for all of them. Come back.
Zariel Torgan 02:55:55 OK. 15, and then their DEX is plus 3, so 18. 18.
Cletus Cobbington 02:56:07 Thank you for watching.
Dungeon Master 02:56:17 You said that it's 16? Or 18? Okay. Okay. After your turn, normally it would do Break Concentration, but it used all of its Legendary actions. So, will it still use it? No, it can't. It can't. Okay. Leopold, it can't do anything in between turns though.
Kaladen Shash 02:56:39 you
Cletus Cobbington 02:56:44 1.5 mm 2.5 mm
Leopold Magnus 02:56:50 I don't think I'm getting any closer to the brain with all those wolves. So I guess I'll just do some ranged attacks here. I am going to cast...I'm going to cast a Cannon. But I'm going to upcast it. Let's see, I think I can cast it up to the...
Dungeon Master 02:56:53 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:57:18 Yeah, I'm going to cast it third level. Catapult. So it's a deck save of 16. I was hoping that, yeah. Oh, it fails. Aww.
Dungeon Master 02:57:30 I don't think the Elder Brain is very dexterous. It'll use its first legendary resistance to succeed. Yeah. Yeah, for sure.
Kaladen Shash 02:57:34 I'm gonna guess no bigfoot and blob. Oh.
Zariel Torgan 02:57:44 Hey, Jonathan, real quick. I didn't move on my turn. Could I move? I just wanted to move away. OK, I just want to move back over behind this pillar, right about there. OK, I can't get behind it. All right, that's good. Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:57:48 Damn it All right, um
Dungeon Master 02:58:08 Okay, you burn its first legendary's distance. Magic's down. 19 hits. 11 damage. Another mech damage.
Leopold Magnus 02:58:14 And then I'll use my bonus action to just throw a magic stone. 19 to hit. And I think that was my last stone. But max damage on that, 11. I'll take it. And then...
Dungeon Master 02:58:37 Heroic move. Tower.
Kaladen Shash 02:58:41 Thanks.
Leopold Magnus 02:58:42 I think I'm gonna kind of run back and join Zariel behind this pillar. And I'll call that pillar, boys. Yeah, yeah. It looks like a pretty good spot back there, but if I join you, and I'll lunge on over, and whether he likes it or not, I'll hide right up behind him.
Cletus Cobbington 02:58:51 The Pillar Boys
Dungeon Master 02:59:12 At the start of his turn. He's surrounded. He is pretty hurt. It's pretty hurt. Uhm? OK, really difficult. It's mind blast recharge doesn't get it. Uhm?
Leopold Magnus 02:59:12 That's my turn.
Zariel Torgan 02:59:25 I saw a dick hanging off his brain, it's a he.
Kaladen Shash 02:59:28 Bye-bye.
Dungeon Master 02:59:43 Man, okay. Oh man. What can I do? It will just... It's not gonna prioritize the bats. It's gonna go for Kaladin. Kaladin, it's gonna make its tentacle attack on you.
Dungeon Master 03:00:12 But I just don't know that it's still good. Natural 20. Sorry. I think 20 just hit. Give me your image. Roll to hit. Roll to see if it hits that. Because I'm going to say nat 20 is always hit. That's the rule.
Zariel Torgan 03:00:18 Jesus Wait, don't you have mirror don't you have mirror image?
Kaladen Shash 03:00:19 Oh, really? I mean, I can get higher than that if I do. Shield oh 27 I cannot. What is that? Oh, it's running your image up. Yes, yes. It's image. It's an image.
Cletus Cobbington 03:00:39 All right. Well... I'm real hurt. I'm gonna...
Dungeon Master 03:00:43 Let's see it, let's see it. It's the image. Your mirror image takes 40 points of bludgeoning damage and explodes. Cletus, it is your turn. You're looking real hurt. Cyrus from the other corner just goes, oh.
Zariel Torgan 03:00:51 God damn. It's always such a good call, your image. Your microphone didn't like it.
Kaladen Shash 03:00:52 There it is. Poof. So I got two of them. Couldn't hear. Yeah, I couldn't hear, but it was good. It was soft mumble.
Leopold Magnus 03:00:55 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:01:13 He just said that he was going to heal him on his turn. And that was it. It wasn't at all helpful.
Cletus Cobbington 03:01:15 What was that? You broke up. Okay, well I'm also going... I'm gonna bonus action 3rd level healing word myself.
Kaladen Shash 03:01:21 Soft mumble. All I got.
Leopold Magnus 03:01:22 That's funny because Travis is always garbled on as well.
Cletus Cobbington 03:01:41 uh give me please roll good 24 that's pretty good give myself a little hp back and then how close are all these wolves to those mind flayers in the brain
Dungeon Master 03:01:51 Come on, come on, come on. Good healing. Bats. They are within combat of all of them. So unless you're below the brain, you don't really have a good sight on it,
Zariel Torgan 03:01:54 I'm
Cletus Cobbington 03:02:11 Oh, they're back. My real question... Are they within five feet though? Okay. Um...
Dungeon Master 03:02:19 And then the mind flare you can see it direct on. Yes, they're in melee range. OK.
Cletus Cobbington 03:02:36 I'm just gonna have, they're just gonna have to take, take a little bit. I'm gonna, fuck you, I'm gonna use Moonbeam again on the guy on the top left. Come on. Damn. Alright, so that was a third level Moonbeam, so...
Zariel Torgan 03:02:38 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 03:02:50 Top left guy, that is just a 9 fair, so he's only got a plus 1 to con. Almost another natural 20, but that's a 9. 21 damage, nice.
Cletus Cobbington 03:03:06 3D10 this time. 21. I don't like hurting animals. I'm sorry, bats. Jesus.
Zariel Torgan 03:03:17 I think they have 22 hit points. That's crazy. Oh no.
Dungeon Master 03:03:18 Oh yeah, your bats, those two each take 21 points of damage. They do, they're each at one hit point.
Cletus Cobbington 03:03:37 They have... wait... oh no. They're gonna have to roll con saves at the start of their turn. They're dead no matter what, and I feel like the moonbeams do more.
Dungeon Master 03:03:49 That's okay. Um, cause what's about to happen is to end Cletus' turn before the bat's turn, Jesse, I'm going to give you a chance to fight this instead of it being just an automatic cancellation on break, uh, concentration. If you take a stress point, we haven't had them in play in a while, so I wanted to make it more relevant again. If you take a stress point, you can basically do like a counter spell attempt on it.
Cletus Cobbington 03:04:08 ស្ក្ក្ក្ក្ក្ក
Zariel Torgan 03:04:17 I'll take it. I will take it. Third. OK. Let's see if I can click on it.
Dungeon Master 03:04:22 OK. What is? Conjure animals at 3rd or 4th level. OK, you were just making a. D20 check with your spellcasting modifier DC 13.
Kaladen Shash 03:04:24 Silence.
Zariel Torgan 03:04:46 Oh, it's not going to let me roll for it. So a d20, I'm going to need a 13 plus 5. OK. That's a 23.
Cletus Cobbington 03:04:49 ស្រូងស្រូងស្រូងស្រូងស្រូងស្រូងស្រូងស្រូងស្រូងស្រូងស្រូងស្រូងស្រូងស្រូងស្រូងស្រូងស្រូងស្រូងស្រូងស្រូងស�
Dungeon Master 03:04:54 D20 and you get a plus five. 23. You see the brain sends out a pulse directed.
Dungeon Master 03:05:07 Straight towards you, but you have this sort of arcane energy that sort of just constantly flows through you and you have a very different autonomy and makeup than even just Leopold. You see when it hits you, something in your body fights back and it is almost repelled and your bats being next are not dispelled. Go ahead and take your.
Zariel Torgan 03:05:30 Nice. All right, these two over here. Oh, gotcha. All right, let me add in my stress point real quick. Any guesses on how many I have? Oh, this one makes six. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 03:05:34 Yeah. Oh yeah, you're juicing it up for sure. I think I have like three at max.
Dungeon Master 03:05:36 Eight attacks. Total, I think you've got seven, right?
Cletus Cobbington 03:05:38 Click OK.
Kaladen Shash 03:05:48 I think you're the leader right now.
Zariel Torgan 03:05:58 I really want to know what happens. Okay, so 8 attacks. So I'm just going to roll 8 d20, so 4 at a time. Okay, that's good, because that's 3 7 8 8.
Dungeon Master 03:06:10 You get advantage, too, because you're pretty much always flanking. So the first one is 7. Second one is 8, plus whatever they get to add. On the mind flare,
Cletus Cobbington 03:06:18 1-2-3-4-5-6
Zariel Torgan 03:06:23 OK. So 3, 7, 8, 8. Oh, so these are all better. So it's basically 8, 10, 11, and 19. All of that plus 4. So 8, 10, 11, and 19.
Dungeon Master 03:06:40 in the top corner, anything below a 15 on it? It'll either be the first two or the last two attacks. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 03:06:50 Okay, so I just rolled four twice. That's for the first four that are around the brain. And then I'm gonna roll four again for the last two with advantage. So that would be 12, 14, and then higher for the other two, for the first four attacks. What's the AC on that? Okay, so I'll roll that real quick.
Cletus Cobbington 03:06:55 8-10 cm.
Dungeon Master 03:07:14 Okay, so they all hit. Brain's only got an 8D of 10. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 03:07:16 Well.
Zariel Torgan 03:07:18 And then I'll roll this next 4d4 is the other two bats with advantage. So that's gonna be, oh yeah, 18, 19, yeah. Okay, so that's gonna be six hit there, and then this next four is gonna be for the two over the Mind Flayer. So all six of those hit, and then for here, 16 and 19.
Dungeon Master 03:07:43 Both of those hit. So 66 plus big. Oh, yes, 12.
Zariel Torgan 03:07:45 Okay, so all 8 hit, so I'm gonna roll 6. Let me just check it real quick. It's 1d6 plus 2 piercing damage, so that's... Yeah, so 1, 2, I think it'd be 12. 6d6, and this is for the brain, so that's gonna be 30 damage on the brain, and...
Zariel Torgan 03:08:15 11 damage on the Mind Flayer. Nice.
Dungeon Master 03:08:25 Good turn. Elder Brain's looking pretty hurt. Okay. After the Bat's turn, it's really pissed about that. It's going to use another Legendary action. So it's second to do Break Concentration again.
Dungeon Master 03:08:54 Instead of doing the same thing each time, I'm going to say you can do another stress point and instead this time try to break connection on the psychic link. If you want, otherwise it'll just end the spell. Thoughts?
Zariel Torgan 03:09:29 Sorry, I was talking that whole time and I was muted. That was just me being dumb. I said I would take the stress point the moment you brought it up. I'm gonna take all of them, and I'm gonna be the first one to turn into SpongeBob SquarePants or whatever happens, so. Alright.
Kaladen Shash 03:09:32 All of them. The ultimate power.
Dungeon Master 03:09:40 Okay. Okay, you take your seventh checkpoint and then go ahead and give me, it is a DC 18 charisma saving throw.
Leopold Magnus 03:09:49 Yeah, you're going to turn it a short scenario.
Zariel Torgan 03:10:02 I literally can't. Oh wait, no. If I roll a natural 20 or a 19, I can make it. I rolled an 18. Yeah. Yeah. No, I got nothing. It's okay.
Kaladen Shash 03:10:09 You got this. Oh, right there. Right there. No.
Dungeon Master 03:10:15 Oh, you're not blessed. You're not inspired. OK.
Dungeon Master 03:10:30 You still take the stress point, but it doesn't. Oh, it still does it, yeah. OK. It uses break concentration, forcing you to lose your eight bats. That's old school. That's high school.
Zariel Torgan 03:10:43 I was a boy. Now I'm a bat. I know.
Dungeon Master 03:10:58 uh shit okay um and then it is cyrus's turn cyrus seeing what just happened he sees the brain is pretty hurt um fetus you're still pretty hurt though right okay uh playing his character from i'm not gonna put him in danger i think he's gonna focus on
Cletus Cobbington 03:11:16 I'm not the healthiest. Okay. Much obliged. Nice.
Zariel Torgan 03:11:18 hm hm hm
Dungeon Master 03:11:25 He's just going to do a third level healing word on you. You take 18 points.
Dungeon Master 03:11:52 Okay, and then bonus action. He can't do anything. So then it is down to Kaladin. Delete these. Yeah, I mean he doesn't. Oh, he can do it again. OK, he will take his attack action on. With my player right in front of him. First one is a.
Cletus Cobbington 03:12:02 Well, Healing Word is a bonus action though. Oh, it is.
Kaladen Shash 03:12:12 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 03:12:21 15 which hits second one is a. 17 which hits so he's going to do 46 plus 16 total. It was only temporary that common motions isn't great for battle application, but I wanted to do something. It's not. Permanent.
Zariel Torgan 03:12:33 Is that the one that he calmed? Gotcha, OK.
Dungeon Master 03:12:50 Now he does 27 points to it. First damage it's taken. And that takes it to 40. Okay. But that also heals you. So then after that, we have
Dungeon Master 03:13:16 this one at the top here. At the top of his turn, he takes Moonbeam damage. Correct. Oh, Kaladin, you get to go. Yes, I did skip you. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 03:13:26 Uh, yeah. Yeah, he's... Not good.
Kaladen Shash 03:13:26 Did I get skipped? I wanna go. Uh, I'm gonna. I'm gonna bonus action and Misty step. Onto the elder brain. If I'm standing on it, would I have advantage on the like a melee attack like it is a massive surface? I am just stabbing.
Dungeon Master 03:13:55 No, I'm not going to give you advantage because it's not prone or anything. But I'll lower its AC even further. You can't miss, essentially. You're trying to get a crip in. It's squirming. It's not easy to hit.
Kaladen Shash 03:14:02 Okay. That's all right. That's all right, I was just trying to get, yeah, so it's okay. I wasn't worried about hitting, I just wanted to, that's all I was trying to do. All right, let's try it. Here's damage on the first hit, swing again. Oh gosh, soft each time.
Zariel Torgan 03:14:15 27 is not bad.
Dungeon Master 03:14:29 And obviously it's 14 and 13, 17 total and 27. I'm showing a lot of wear in here.
Kaladen Shash 03:14:32 17 total damage Oh, sorry, sorry 27, yeah 14. No, it's not bad. Let's get around And I just kind of I crouched a little bit like I that second stab I like I
Kaladen Shash 03:14:57 Splitters just like stabbed right into it and I just kind of cracked up a little bit of stability while light splitters just stabbed into the brain.
Dungeon Master 03:15:02 Okay. Crouch down, get a little bit more braced. After that, it is... This guy. Started his turn, he takes Moonbeam damage, correct? That is a 13. He fails.
Cletus Cobbington 03:15:04 Yeah. I can't check though. Fold A image. Load and roll amazing. Twelve.
Zariel Torgan 03:15:30 Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 03:15:32 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 03:15:34 He's got... let me do the dead. Okay. Very hurt but not dead. He is going to use his action. He grabs the chains and you see he channels his life force.
Dungeon Master 03:15:50 into the elder brain. Kaladin, you're standing on it and your sword is forced backwards out of the tissue that makes up its brain and that like little impervious barrier forms around itself. Because he did that, this other guy leaves Cyrus's base to get to the top, which he will take another attack.
Kaladen Shash 03:16:16 I guess. Excellent, Silas. Peacemaker. Make peace. That's great. That's gas in him.
Dungeon Master 03:16:21 That's a natural 20. I don't know how it's going. 31 points of damage. It is looking incredibly hurt. Not dead.
Zariel Torgan 03:16:25 Nice. Those are the only natural 20s you're allowed to roll. Yeah, make pieces. Nice. Jesus Christ. Oh.
Cletus Cobbington 03:16:28 If you have any questions or comments, please post them in the chat box.
Leopold Magnus 03:16:29 Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 03:16:49 Does it still have, are those chains still hot? Is that under? Concentration dropped, okay, sorry. Oh no, yeah, you did the wolf.
Dungeon Master 03:16:53 But it can't do anything because there's already being life force channeled. It will grab the change and prepare itself. Top of the order, Zariel. I don't think he's concentrating on that anymore. Oh yeah, it did it out of spite too.
Zariel Torgan 03:17:01 No, that dropped a while ago. Yeah. Let's see. I will move up.
Cletus Cobbington 03:17:19 If you have any questions or comments, please post them in the chat box.
Zariel Torgan 03:17:30 forward. I'll move up 30 feet, as close as I can. And I will cast Heat Metal on the chains again. And then it's a con save to not drop them. So he'll take the damage regardless. So that's a fail.
Leopold Magnus 03:17:41 Nice.
Dungeon Master 03:17:42 OK. 13. Let's go. But give him the damage. And that's 7 damage. OK. Takes the damage.
Cletus Cobbington 03:17:49 Ctrl-Ctrl-V Ctrl-V
Zariel Torgan 03:18:00 Mm-hm. Mm, okay. So, oh, never mind, okay. I can't do anything as a bonus action, so that's it.
Dungeon Master 03:18:17 OK. Leopold, it is your turn. Brain is looking pretty hurt, but temporarily invulnerable. Both of the mind flares are looking fairly hurt. And you guys get the sense that mechanically, each time there are mind flares from the layer action in play, more don't come in. So as long as these two are alive, you're not going to have to worry about more amassing each single time.
Leopold Magnus 03:18:23 Excellent. Right, but in order to attack the brain,
Leopold Magnus 03:18:53 We have to take them out, right? Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. So I can't reach them with my sword, unfortunately, so I'm going to have to take a ranged attack. And the one on the right is looking pretty hurt, right?
Dungeon Master 03:18:54 You got to take them out, yeah. But you're not going to get overwhelmed with numbers. The one on the right is on death's door. The one on the left is knocking on death's door.
Cletus Cobbington 03:19:01 Ja. Knock.
Leopold Magnus 03:19:23 Okay. Then I'm just, I'm not gonna take any chances. I'm gonna cast a catapult. And at this moment, I'll do it at the second level. On the rightmost guy. 15 is the save.
Dungeon Master 03:19:42 On which one? Dex 36, throw. I rolled a 17 to save. No catapults all or nothing.
Leopold Magnus 03:19:54 Fuck me. No, no, no. Catapults all or nothing, yeah. Yeah, he's not very dexterous, but he's rolled well. Okay, so the catapult goes wide, and I don't have any bonus action right now because I ran out of stones, so I'll cast Magic Stone to bring that up.
Kaladen Shash 03:19:57 Create half damage. It may not take too much. Oh.
Cletus Cobbington 03:20:02 1.5.5.5.5.5
Dungeon Master 03:20:22 Okay, cast Hydrix Stone. Okay. After your turn, the Elder Brain goes. It'll see if it gets its Mind Blast back.
Leopold Magnus 03:20:23 And I'll go as close as I can, which I think would be right around here. And that's my train.
Dungeon Master 03:20:44 That's a three, it does not. It is going to attempt to tentacle you, Kaladin. Go ahead and roll to see if your mirror gets hit.
Cletus Cobbington 03:20:57 2.5 cm.
Kaladen Shash 03:21:06 It does indeed. So have one now.
Dungeon Master 03:21:09 OK. Tentacle smashes the one on top of it, almost lowers itself to the ground. And because they're super limited, it really only does the one thing on its turn. After that, it is Cletus.
Cletus Cobbington 03:21:24 are
Cletus Cobbington 03:21:43 I'm gonna summon my Spirit Totem as a bonus action on Kaladin. I'm gonna summon it in the Hawk Totem form. So I use my... Use your reaction to grant an ally advantage on attack. Advantage on perception as well. So... Use your reaction, so that just uses my action, right? So I kind of bonus action, like...
Kaladen Shash 03:21:46 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:21:52 Oh. Setting them up. Let me read it. I am not familiar with Druids.
Cletus Cobbington 03:22:14 Is that how that works? I wanna, I wanna throw it like right here then.
Dungeon Master 03:22:26 Spirit Totem. As a bonus action, you can magically summon a spirit. It's the point you can see. Yeah. In a 30-foot radius around that point. So, it is not just on Kaladin, it is 30 feet around Kaladin. If somebody can get into that space, they can see it. Yeah, so that gives everybody advantage.
Cletus Cobbington 03:22:46 Because that'll be within 10-20 feet of everybody pretty much. Cool. So that's... That's my bonus action. Let's see.
Cletus Cobbington 03:23:13 Okay, I'mma use my action of wild shape to a bear. And I still have, what's bear movement? Still 30, 40, 40. So I guess I'll wrap like up
Dungeon Master 03:23:20 OK, Moonbeam stays, totem goes up, and then you turn into a bear. Jesty, what is it?
Zariel Torgan 03:23:34 I think it's 40. Yeah, it's 40.
Cletus Cobbington 03:23:41 The stairs and get like right here, I guess. That's everything I can do.
Dungeon Master 03:23:49 Okay, good turn. Okay, anything else on your turn? That was pretty good, though. Okay, after your turn, the brain is going to use a legendary action to do another, it's going to use two of them to try to tentacle attack Kaladin again.
Dungeon Master 03:24:18 It is bad news if it's up there. Oh, it rolled the, sorry, it was set to self, it rolled the 26. This one is an 11, which I believe... Yeah, does an 11 hit the AC of the mirror image?
Cletus Cobbington 03:24:20 The end.
Kaladen Shash 03:24:22 Hey, Jonathan, real quick, I rolled to see if it would hit my thing, but don't you still have to hit my AC to make it matter at all? Okay, okay, cool, cool, cool. Okay, follow up. Misses. The mirror image has my AC, I thought.
Kaladen Shash 03:24:51 Or do they have a software AC? Of course, let's see.
Dungeon Master 03:24:53 I think they have a softer AC. But 11 might still miss. His little squirrel hands are turned outward, almost like a Jesus pose.
Cletus Cobbington 03:25:07 I'd like to say my spirit totem is a spectral chip with hawk wings. Luscious, luscious little man.
Zariel Torgan 03:25:13 Yes.
Dungeon Master 03:25:20 He's got long brown hair cascading off his shoulders. Yeah, misses anyway. So rolls the hit, hits your duplicate, misses your duplicate. Which is good. Next one up is Cyrus then. Cyrus has got advantage on the attack because he's in the radius.
Kaladen Shash 03:25:21 Yeah. Yeah, it looks like the AC for the duplicates is 10 plus my dex modifier, so 15 is the AC.
Cletus Cobbington 03:25:45 Uh, I mean just enough to where it covers all of those guys really. I think it was fine where you put it.
Dungeon Master 03:25:52 I'm going to say that you moved your AOE a little bit. Where do you want it? Because you get to place it, really. You can move the AOE. OK. You'll have it sort of on the edge there. And Cyrus will
Dungeon Master 03:26:22 He's got enough movement that he can climb up the pillar and take an attack while still holding on to it. So he's got advantage, but he's like grappling the pillar and swiping above his head. He'll take his two attacks. Got advantage. Roll. Why are you not rolling?
Cletus Cobbington 03:26:38 A little swing.
Dungeon Master 03:26:51 Uh, he hit. No crits. Why is not rolling? There it is. Uh, the whole thing is bugging the hell out. Oh.
Cletus Cobbington 03:27:16 1.0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
Dungeon Master 03:27:22 There it is, 11, which is enough because he only has seven hit points. After all of that, he takes his swipes and he cuts the ankles of this Mind Flayer. It falls back once it cuts his legs. Even though they levitate, he like slices its Achilles and it falls back and topples off the pillar, unable to be the next thing in line to take on, giving away HP to the thing. And then after Cyrus's turn,
Dungeon Master 03:27:57 It can't do anything, it uses a tentacle attack. Is anybody concentrating? You've got Moonbeam. It'll use break concentration to get rid of Moonbeam, because that's going to take out its only shield in a second. OK, and then it's Kaladin's go.
Zariel Torgan 03:28:03 I still have heat metal up.
Kaladen Shash 03:28:03 Bless up. I have advantage on my attacks just outright. Uh.
Cletus Cobbington 03:28:03 No. Oh, Moonbeam, yeah, I am. Yep. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 03:28:04 No.
Dungeon Master 03:28:29 Yes, you do. OK. 17 hits.
Cletus Cobbington 03:28:34 Selection is complete. You may now close the browser.
Kaladen Shash 03:28:34 I'll go ahead and make three of my esoptic blast attacks at the other mind player on top of the power. First one. Definitely hit 17. Second one. 16.
Zariel Torgan 03:28:46 Nice.
Dungeon Master 03:29:00 16 hits. It's the same to hit, yeah, 26 hits. Come on. 19, it is so hurt.
Kaladen Shash 03:29:07 I don't know. I'm rolling Firebolt. I'll ask him same numbers 26. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, OK, so here we go 3D 10. Oh, not bad, not bad. And then as an action, can I still take a single attack? Is that right?
Cletus Cobbington 03:29:15 2.5 cm x 5 cm
Zariel Torgan 03:29:20 Silence.
Dungeon Master 03:29:32 Yes, you can. 19 hit. 20 you it has this impervious shield, right? So you do three blasts.
Kaladen Shash 03:29:33 I'm gonna go ahead and just stab the elder blade again with advantage. 19 to hit. Yes, it's better, 20.
Cletus Cobbington 03:29:53 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
Dungeon Master 03:29:58 directly into the mind flare you turn your sword down and try to embed it it's a little bit harder but it goes in and as the sword embeds into the shield you see the mind flare on the pillar that is doing the ritual has its skull sort of caved in by an invisible force and you kill this mind flare over there and the elder brain loses its shield
Kaladen Shash 03:30:18 Excellent! Get him now!
Cletus Cobbington 03:30:23 0.5 cm. 0.5 cm. 1 cm.
Dungeon Master 03:30:28 Zario, it is your turn. Fill up in the air. Nope.
Zariel Torgan 03:30:30 Nice. Nice. All right. He's still up in the air, correct? Okay, what can we do? Second level. Those chains aren't attached to the brain, are they? Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 03:30:31 He's vulnerable!
Cletus Cobbington 03:30:59 Thank you for watching
Zariel Torgan 03:31:00 Is he high enough up that I could conceivably jump as a bear? Like, if I ran over to this and jumped off, well, it's not gonna be like this edge here. Oh, whoops. Yeah, sorry, I didn't mean to move that.
Dungeon Master 03:31:16 Uh, you could, but you are. All the way over there. It would be. 15 feet to the base of the wall. Half speed is to full speed. If you make a good athletic to climb the 10 or so feet up.
Zariel Torgan 03:31:27 Yeah, well, I've got 40 feet as a bear. And so if I could get to, and it's only 37 feet from there. All right, I'd like to try that.
Cletus Cobbington 03:31:41 5.5.5.5.5.
Dungeon Master 03:31:46 I would say you would have just enough to make an attack. Okay, so wild shape into a bear. Step one. Yeah, so go ahead and give me athletics check. This is DC 10. This all kind of hinges on this succeeding, which is why it's a low DC. Yep.
Zariel Torgan 03:31:58 All right, run up and then you said athletics check. To make it up the wall quickly. OK. So just drank for the bear. OK. Come on. 23.
Dungeon Master 03:32:20 23, easy enough, no loss to movement. You climb the 10 feet up the wall. It is then exactly to the end of your movement to get to a point where you can jump and leap. I'm gonna say you don't get both of your attacks. You can take one attack as you fly by.
Zariel Torgan 03:32:35 All right, I'm going to take a claw attack just because I'm reaching. Would I get advantage with Kaladin? I don't know if Kaladin is... Ooh, nice. All right, here comes that natural 20. Oh, a 19. All right.
Cletus Cobbington 03:32:35 Spirit chip. Not so close.
Kaladen Shash 03:32:47 You have advantage, you're in the bubble. Oh.
Dungeon Master 03:32:47 You would get advantage because you're still in the range of the totem. 26 to hit. Skip goes, looks at you, and you can tell he said, bless you, my child.
Zariel Torgan 03:33:05 Very, very fun. So it's going to be 10 slashing damage. I took everything I had just to do that. So I'm just falling down into this after.
Cletus Cobbington 03:33:14 I'm going to go ahead and get started.
Dungeon Master 03:33:15 And damage. Good hit. Anything else on your turn, sir? You fall only about 15 feet before you land on a mass of tentacles. You are probably 10, 15 feet below it. So you'd have to get up onto the stairs and back up again to get into range. But after your turn, it is limp.
Zariel Torgan 03:33:40 Okay.
Dungeon Master 03:33:43 It is looking hurt. It is well below half its hit points. And you would gauge just by looking at it that it looks underneath what would be the equivalent of 100 hit points. It's looking tough. It's looking rough.
Leopold Magnus 03:33:58 Cool. So I'm about 25, 30 feet away. I guess you said there's a staircase here, so there's some vertical height I have to climb to get to the Elder Brain. Okay. I guess I'm just wondering if it's feasible for me to get in Melee Ranch. Sounds like maybe not.
Dungeon Master 03:34:08 Yeah, so you have to go 10 feet and then 10 feet up on an athletics check. Otherwise, it's half your movement and it would take you almost all your movement to get up the wall. You've got 35 feet of movement.
Cletus Cobbington 03:34:08 🤔
Kaladen Shash 03:34:30 you.
Leopold Magnus 03:34:30 Uh, I think it's just 30. Let me see. 30 feet. Okay. That would be, yeah, that would be a one, one attack. Got it.
Dungeon Master 03:34:38 It'd be the same thing with Zariel. So you could feasibly, on a great athletics check, jump just at the last second to get one attack in as you passed it in the air. Mm-hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 03:34:54 0.5 cm.
Leopold Magnus 03:35:00 I think in that particular case, I will just position myself up on top here, and then what I'll do is I will cast... It's really pissing me off with these legendary resistances. I'll cast Ice Knife, and that will be...
Cletus Cobbington 03:35:27 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm
Leopold Magnus 03:35:30 I think, what's the benefit if I upcast it? It just does more damage, right? Trying to see, at higher levels, 1d6 for every slot above the first. So, okay, so that would hit, that would do, okay. I'll cast Ice Knife at third level at the brain.
Dungeon Master 03:35:35 For what? Okay. Do you want to avoid having it explode next to Kaladin? Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 03:35:48 But.
Leopold Magnus 03:35:59 Uh, yeah, I mean, I should be able to easily do that, right? Cause the brain and him are, he's like falling and, um, Oh, he's on top of the brain. Okay. Yeah. I was sick and sorry. Uh, is there a positioning I could, I mean, this brain's pretty large. Could I, could I kind of, okay. Yeah. So yeah, directly target that and 17 to hit.
Cletus Cobbington 03:36:05 He's hooked in.
Dungeon Master 03:36:06 Cowden's on top, safely secured. Yeah, he jumped on top of it. Yeah, you could put it in like the bottom of it. Go for the cerebellum. 17 hits.
Kaladen Shash 03:36:14 Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 03:36:31 Excellent. So then this is at the third level. So it would be 1d6 for every slot above first. So it would be 2d6 and 1d10. 1d10. 10 damage. And then
Cletus Cobbington 03:36:41 1.5.5.5.5.5.5
Dungeon Master 03:36:56 After all the damage has happened. Let's go High Deck Save. Natural 2 for a total of 2. It's going to use its second Legendary Resistance to succeed.
Leopold Magnus 03:37:01 It explodes and it will do another, oh, it has to succeed a deck save of 16. Oh man, all right. The knife explodes and would have done 2d6 damage.
Cletus Cobbington 03:37:15 Ctrl-Ctrl-V Ctrl-V
Zariel Torgan 03:37:23 Mmm.
Leopold Magnus 03:37:32 Brain narrowly avoids it. Then, with my bonus action, I will throw a magic stone. 18 would hit. 10 damage with the stone. Jeez. Did the same amount with that stone as I did with that ice knight.
Dungeon Master 03:37:34 You see it just quivers enough to get it all. Okay, go for it. This is looking dire. Alright, 18 hits. 10 more damage.
Cletus Cobbington 03:37:51 5.5.5 5.5.5
Leopold Magnus 03:38:02 For yeah, 20 damage total. And I'll move as close as I can to have a chance at it coming down on him next round melee.
Dungeon Master 03:38:17 Okay, you go there. Okay, good turn. It's going to go all out. I rolled it right there. Mind Blast recharges on a five or a six. You see on its last turn very fittingly probably because I don't think it's going to last much longer than that.
Cletus Cobbington 03:38:26 0.5 cm. 0.5 cm. 0.5 cm. 0.5 cm.
Dungeon Master 03:38:34 It is going to use its mind blast to read it for you guys. Creatures of the elder brains choice within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 18 intelligence save or take 5d10 plus 5 psychic damage and be stunned for one minute. So creatures is plural. So I'm going to do within 30 feet. That'll be Cletus. Zariel.
Cletus Cobbington 03:39:01 The Bayer Brothers. What kind of saving throw?
Dungeon Master 03:39:03 paladin and leopold everybody go in of anybody but cyrus give me a saving throw there this is an intelligent saving throw
Zariel Torgan 03:39:05 Hello.
Kaladen Shash 03:39:14 And it was the. Tome just for attacks. Intelligence. Uhm, Cyrus and Cyrus and Leopold would still have a D4 bonus. Correct.
Leopold Magnus 03:39:26 Okay, all right Yeah, good thing I'm not a monkey anymore That's uh, that's really helpful though I think it may have been a
Dungeon Master 03:39:34 Blessed is concentration, right? Have you not cast any other concentrations? Well, that's good for you. Okay, that's a 20. That's a pass. Kaladin is gonna...
Cletus Cobbington 03:39:37 Silence. Silence.
Kaladen Shash 03:39:43 No, I think it's rolling with that thing, man. I'm also gonna use my 1D8. Not bad, got a one, man. 14. Ah, come on.
Zariel Torgan 03:39:52 Yeah. I got a 17. Oh, 17 fails. Oof.
Dungeon Master 03:40:05 Total of 14. 14 failed. 17 failed. DC 18. But you were both resistant, but you will be stunned. So both of you take half damage. You will take 22 points of psychic damage.
Cletus Cobbington 03:40:09 bye!
Leopold Magnus 03:40:17 Well, I think that, yeah. Okay. Okay. So if I pass, I'd take half of that 22.
Dungeon Master 03:40:35 And anybody who got less than 18 is also stunned. If you passed, you take half. Well, if you passed, you take quarter, because it's already half because of your resistance. And you take half of that. So you would take 11. 44 to 22 to 11.
Leopold Magnus 03:40:48 Oh, a quarter. I was quartered. It was initially 22 damage. Ah, I see. Got it. Damn, 44 is a big hit.
Zariel Torgan 03:40:50 Yeah, I'm still a bear.
Dungeon Master 03:41:11 Everybody OK? Still standing? Nicely done. OK. After that, Cletus, it's your go. You're a bear. Yeah. That'll be to your bear health. The bear has got like 50-something hit points, it feels like.
Kaladen Shash 03:41:14 Stop.
Cletus Cobbington 03:41:25 All right, that damage was to my bear health, not my health health, right? All righty, um... Let's see... Well... Let me just fucking...
Zariel Torgan 03:41:30 Mm-hmm. Yeah, 42. But yeah, pretty close.
Cletus Cobbington 03:41:53 Go for this fucker. Let me... I'll move up. I'll use my movement and get up on this brain. And then I'll take... I'll take two... let's see... Yeah, I'll take two claw attacks.
Dungeon Master 03:41:57 Oh, fucker. Easy enough. Okay, you had enough movement that you can jump up on top of it. You joined Kaladin. You see he's sort of crouched down, sword embedded into the brain, holding on.
Dungeon Master 03:42:26 You land on top, you feel like the squishiness under your feet, go ahead and take your two attacks. And you can get into the advantage range. You get advantage. Oh, that was...
Cletus Cobbington 03:42:35 And these are plastic. Oh, it's terrible. Uh, yeah. So I get advantage. Okay, so then roll those again then. Okay, one of those will do something. Terrible. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 03:42:56 Jerry Torrens?
Dungeon Master 03:42:58 Okay, 30, 20. Heavy hit.
Leopold Magnus 03:43:04 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 03:43:07 What is my plus? What a... Crazy! This is my first time being a bear, guys! Rawr! Well, that wasn't very... crazy. Let's see, anything else I can do?
Zariel Torgan 03:43:26 but but but
Dungeon Master 03:43:33 It hits a hit. Okay, that's a good thing because I was about to hit you. No, you hit. You turn invisible after your turn. It is going to Legendary Action and Tentacle Attack count in them.
Cletus Cobbington 03:43:37 You know what? I'm real embarrassed. I'm gonna bonus action Hidden Step and just turn invisible. That hurt my feelings.
Kaladen Shash 03:43:44 Yeah, that's going to.
Zariel Torgan 03:44:01 Silence.
Dungeon Master 03:44:04 Here we go, no whammies. 25 to hit. Dude! Nice. Okay. Then it's Cyrus's turn.
Cletus Cobbington 03:44:09 The end.
Kaladen Shash 03:44:13 It's going to hit my last duplicate. Done.
Dungeon Master 03:44:27 I'm not going to take this from you guys. He uses his whole movement but he can't do any attacks because again, Travis has zero ranged attacks whatsoever. Kaladin, it is... Yeah. It'll use its last legendary action to break concentration. It's going to end your Bless.
Kaladen Shash 03:44:42 I get to use the end of my turn noted to try to save it. Or is it started from end of turn? What save is it? Is it con or intelligence? OK. Yeah, so soft.
Dungeon Master 03:44:58 But then, yes, end of your turn, go ahead and repeat your save. Intelligent save. And does not succeed. Well then, question for you.
Cletus Cobbington 03:45:04 I'm.
Kaladen Shash 03:45:20 Just laying there. I'm just sitting out these last two rounds. I'm good. Yeah, give me that stress point. Give me that stress point. Still didn't work. Six. I can't roll higher than single digits.
Dungeon Master 03:45:29 would count in. Okay, you take that stress point, go ahead and roll. Two eights. Okay, you rolled it anyway. I love it. I was gonna say, yeah, that's tough. Yeah, I'm sorry. Well, I won't give you an infinity set. End of your turn. Top of the round is Azariel.
Zariel Torgan 03:45:37 Alright. I am going to.
Cletus Cobbington 03:45:37 We're all just stressed the fuck out.
Kaladen Shash 03:45:52 forgot.
Zariel Torgan 03:46:07 Hmm, I'm still a bear. I'm just gonna swipe at this guy. Can I just jump twice since I'm directly underneath it? Can I walk over and jump? Okay. I'll take two attacks with advantage. So this is gonna be the claw attack. Gonna be a 17.
Dungeon Master 03:46:18 This GTN. 17 hits. 23 hits.
Kaladen Shash 03:46:28 Get them down. Nice. All right.
Zariel Torgan 03:46:33 And this is going to be the bite attack. As I'm running up and I'm just clawing at the bottom of this spicy meatball at the 23. So that's going to be 6 on the bite and 15 on the claw for a total of 21.
Cletus Cobbington 03:46:56 A cloud...
Dungeon Master 03:46:57 Okay. Not dead, but close.
Zariel Torgan 03:47:02 Get him, Leo.
Kaladen Shash 03:47:03 Ridiculous, man. Finish him, Leopold. Finish him.
Leopold Magnus 03:47:09 I've got this, and I just take a jump, massive jump. You hear the springs and the pistons and the steam blasting out of my feet, and I fly out into midair with my laser sword, spinning at high velocity. All you can see is just a blur of orange
Leopold Magnus 03:47:37 And I'm going to slice at the brain with a melee attack. Come on, baby. Fuck. And you drop bluffs because you got disrupted. Oh, it does? No way. This thing is squishy. OK.
Zariel Torgan 03:47:48 Yeah, damn. Oh, man.
Dungeon Master 03:47:55 11 does hit though. Yeah, 8C-10. Unfortunately, that was advantage.
Kaladen Shash 03:47:59 Yeah. Yeah. The peak. No. Yeah, same thing you read that during that. Without one. Yeah. Hit him again.
Cletus Cobbington 03:48:01 And you'd have advantage anyway. Oh, I see.
Leopold Magnus 03:48:08 Uh, uh, yeah. Through the one. But that's alright. I'll make up with the fire damage here. So, 13 damage. And, uh, the second swing coming in. Oh, for fuck's sake. Oh, but I have advantage. And it hits him. Doesn't matter.
Kaladen Shash 03:48:31 It hits him. Yeah. I guess it's still a crypt bill. Run the advantage. Must have to. Still a crypt bill. There you go. Hit him. Hit him for everything.
Leopold Magnus 03:48:36 I guess if I have advantage, I might as well roll again. 19 to hit. That does make. So here comes sliding in there. Just a slash, and that's also more fire damage. Oh, baby, Mac damage. Yep, 19 damage.
Dungeon Master 03:48:40 Do you have it? Yeah, go ahead. 19. Leopold, describe how you finish the Elder Brain.
Kaladen Shash 03:49:00 That's better. That's better. Yes, 19.
Zariel Torgan 03:49:08 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 03:49:09 Okay, yeah, so I'm on the edge of the stairwell, and like I said, the steam just kind of builds until you hear this obnoxiously loud hiss, and my entire body, stiff as a board, just kind of goes flying straight at him. Laser sword activates. It's a whirlwind of hot plasma kind of flying around. You haven't quite seen this tactic where it's almost like a blur of a blade, it's moving so fast.
Leopold Magnus 03:49:39 And I just continue past the elder brain, stiff as a board, and make firm contact on the other side, unflinching, not stumbling, not moving forward. Don't even look back, and the elder brain just falls into very clean, sliced pieces. And you'll see on my blade a glimmer, and it almost appears as if the soul of that elder brain had been pulled in, and I
Dungeon Master 03:49:45 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 03:50:09 that will be the, I haven't used this before, but that will be the overcharge. And so that life force will be on my blade, and then I can add a 1d6 necrotic damage next strike I take with it. Yeah, I was just looking at that, and I was like, oh man, I've been totally missing out.
Dungeon Master 03:50:29 Hey! Forgot it did that. After an intense fight, up and down, really drug out Leopold in an unusual show of perfect coordination and strength,
Kaladen Shash 03:50:30 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 03:50:34 Please.
Cletus Cobbington 03:50:47 Yes.
Dungeon Master 03:50:54 launches himself, the stone cracks underneath his feet as he launches, spinning through the air, perfectly straight with his feet spinning like a top sideways. That's fully through the top of the lobe of the brain and the offset of weight from the sudden release of pressure as the brain lobe split, tears through the center as the top is seared open. Leopold crashes on the ground.
Dungeon Master 03:51:18 perfectly still the ground crunched under his feet but he doesn't waver and then the brain slops off toast both sides half of it lands in the brine pool and floating the other half hits the ground with cowded on it you slide perfectly onto the ground in front as the lobe is behind you you guys have defeated my elder brain
Cletus Cobbington 03:51:42 Boom. We got two bears. I got a bear. I embarrassed myself with my bear.
Leopold Magnus 03:51:44 Oh dear, did I get him? Oh, oh, Zariel, you better get out of there. You're getting covered in that goop. Can't imagine that's good for your skin.
Kaladen Shash 03:51:44 Excellent.
Zariel Torgan 03:51:44 Nice. Heck yeah, you got him. I'll walk away and I'll shed my bear form.
Dungeon Master 03:52:06 Spirit chip lowers to the ground. The other bear comes out of the shadows. Yeah, go ahead and give me an investigation check. Anybody else wants to do something they can too?
Cletus Cobbington 03:52:14 I'm still a bear, but I'm a little bit sad.
Zariel Torgan 03:52:18 Peace.
Leopold Magnus 03:52:20 Jonathan, can I do an investigation through the remains of this brain or maybe the pod? Just kind of pawing through, see if there's anything interesting in there. 17.
Dungeon Master 03:52:38 No, these are pretty alien forms. You don't see anything on it. Rex, go ahead and write down elder brain parts. And then, I don't know, in parentheses or dash or something, write moderate success.
Kaladen Shash 03:52:39 Is there, is there anything of value on, on these persons investigate the bodies?
Leopold Magnus 03:52:58 Okay. Elder brain parts. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 03:53:05 Can I just glance and see if I can see anything of value floating around, like anything precious metals or stuff? Is that a perception? I'm very manipulative. Oh, I clicked it twice. I got what I deserved.
Dungeon Master 03:53:18 Yeah, go for it. I don't know. Well, you worded it very carefully, so I imagine that's what you wanted. Clear. Natural too. No, but you don't feel like you're missing anything either. Again, this is a hive mind species that spreads just through infecting hosts.
Zariel Torgan 03:53:46 Hmm. Gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah. Just their Beanie Baby collection.
Dungeon Master 03:53:46 These are all like the mutated bodies of those creatures. These don't, they're not materialistic. They don't refine coin or anything like that. You could probably like scrap them worth off of like, they have like steel plate breastplates that they've crafted, but like nothing crazy expensive in here.
Kaladen Shash 03:54:09 Roger that.
Dungeon Master 03:54:09 Just a Beanie Beanie collection and the brain mass that Leopold is harvesting for his, whatever he uses it for. No, that's just, I had it blocked off originally, but it was a weird dark thing on the screen, so I got rid of it.
Leopold Magnus 03:54:18 Jonathan, is this map real? Is there actually a statue in the corner here? Okay. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 03:54:29 Yep. I know, that was actually such a fun fight. It was really tedious, but it was really fun.
Dungeon Master 03:54:37 OK, and we're definitely going to end it there, because that's 11.30. But nice session, you guys. Travis missed another one. Thanks.
Zariel Torgan 03:54:43 Yeah, good job Yeah
Kaladen Shash 03:54:44 Yeah, really fun session, really fun session. Yeah, man. I didn't realize, I didn't realize you could move it. That was great.
Leopold Magnus 03:54:48 That was badass. Had to kill the guards so we could kill the brain. That thing's brutal.
Cletus Cobbington 03:54:55 I finally felt useful damage just spamming fucking moonbeam cuz it kept working. I've never used it. I was never in a position I felt like in the last couple sessions to where I would like really benefit cuz it was like none of them were ever like a boss so like the fact that I can move it I'm like I need something that's gonna be there for a while.
Dungeon Master 03:55:00 Dude, what do you mean sucks? It was just like, okay, start of the turn, take damage. Okay, you moved it. Okay, it takes damage again. Mm-hmm. It worked out great and you stayed enough out of the fight
Cletus Cobbington 03:55:26 Like. Yeah. Right.
Zariel Torgan 03:55:26 Yeah, absolutely.
Kaladen Shash 03:55:26 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:55:29 That you weren't like always harming the brain you were always hitting mind flares that you were never going to be the target for concentration breaking because you weren't directly impacting it that much. Where is like just he was trying to make them drop the chain so it was like an immediate response if they drop it it doesn't get the bonus right.
Dungeon Master 03:55:48 So the fact that you were like, no, I'm going to keep it on this dude who's not the active target, but whittle him down was really clutch because then it came to his turn and he had seven HP and I was like, oh, well, he's one shot. Right. That was good.
Cletus Cobbington 03:55:54 Yeah, I'm like... Yeah, because then it's like, you know, you could keep it on the brain, it's gonna hurt the other, you know, the pillar dudes anyway, but might as well get a for sure damage, because they're not fucking moving. You don't have to waste an action every fucking time.
Zariel Torgan 03:56:03 Nice. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 03:56:18 When they couldn't go up there to be sacrificial. They were dead. Yeah, that's valid. I wanted to be a monkey for longer, but that was probably good, because that thing was dishing damage. Yeah, like two turns of, did like 60 damage. Yeah, you're like, I gotta figure out how to deal with that.
Dungeon Master 03:56:23 Yeah. God, that was ridiculous. That started the fight hard. I was like, holy shit.
Cletus Cobbington 03:56:27 That's good. Uh...
Zariel Torgan 03:56:33 You did a lot of damage just for when you did it. Go ahead. Oh yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:56:48 And then for that went to around eight for seven full rounds. I didn't once roll to get the, the mind blast back. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 03:56:57 Yeah, thank goodness. Stunning is ridiculous. Yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 03:57:00 That thing was crazy. That did a lot of damage. Boy, you had that. Oh. Oh, I forgot. That would have made you permadead if you had gone below five. Yeah, so it wasn't even like we could get you picked up. You just would have been toast.
Cletus Cobbington 03:57:05 Yo, I almost fucking died. I was 5 hit points. If I got hit by 5 more, I was full dead. That would've sucked. Yeah, that would've... Yeah, I was at 50, he hit me for 45. I was just like, oh no.
Zariel Torgan 03:57:08 Mm, mm, mm.
Dungeon Master 03:57:15 Oh the fucking eating brain thing that mind flayers do is nasty. It would have killed him. It would have outright killed him. Yeah, I'm not.
Kaladen Shash 03:57:25 Oh yeah, we saved him this time.
Cletus Cobbington 03:57:35 That was very glad, which you were nice to realize, and then I was like, well, there's no way I would have known any of this anyways. There's no way I would have possibly got out of that.
Leopold Magnus 03:57:35 yeah how uh how's that brain rot is that percent center will that go away or whatever it is that
Dungeon Master 03:57:52 Luckily there's no other effect for it, but I'll show you. I took a picture of the free roll damage. I hit so few times overall that most of it's not checked off. But where it says brain in the 45 is there, the next attack, if it hit more than once, would have been your HP. It would have been enough to kill you. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 03:58:06 Jesus. Yeah. Oh, Jesus. Yeah, that one would have been perfectly just nuked my ass. Well, that would have been really unfortunate. I was gonna be real sad.
Kaladen Shash 03:58:11 Oh my gosh. Well, look at some of those later 178. You ripped that one.
Leopold Magnus 03:58:22 Yeah. That's funny. I liked Kaladin's mirror image.
Zariel Torgan 03:58:33 Uh, yeah, I am now up to I think seven Yeah, so i'm at seven
Dungeon Master 03:58:34 Yeah, I kill your character. OK, Cletus took a stress point. Zariel, did you take two or three there? You took two, right? Seven. Because you did five and your arm mutated, and so this is two more.
Cletus Cobbington 03:58:35 I mean, I only have a couple sessions in, but still, I'm like... Oh, so...
Dungeon Master 03:59:01 Kaladin, you took another one. What does that put you to? I don't think we ever resolved what happened to you at five, did we? Okay. Well, I'll figure something out. Leopold, did you take a stress point? Great.
Kaladen Shash 03:59:04 I have. I had it marked at 5 before that new one, so 6 currently. No, he didn't. OK.
Cletus Cobbington 03:59:21 So the stress is like something that changes you.
Leopold Magnus 03:59:25 Nope, no stress points. I'm gonna be like way behind.
Dungeon Master 03:59:30 Yeah, you guys don't super know a background. This was super early on stuff. Trace, when you take us were like stress is what makes the curse manifest more. And so people who have the curve, which is all of you is what makes you adventurers. When you push yourself, you can do like extra stuff that you might like fail a check and get to reroll it or
Dungeon Master 03:59:53 just do it enough and make it dire enough that you auto-succeed kind of deal. And depending on how you used it, when the curse manifests, it has like either a negative effect or a positive effect. So most people, when they're normal, just like turn into monsters and stuff. Jesse did it enough times where some of it was to help other people. Other times it was enough to make it like it was a little more self-serving. It was like to self-preserve, persevere himself. So he
Cletus Cobbington 04:00:11 Right. Right. Right.
Dungeon Master 04:00:23 doesn't ever use it because it doesn't ever come to it but he has like a healing ability with his arm where he can take his own hp to heal other people to a certain extent from like the way it manifested but the first person they ever saw with it turned into a fire element so like crazy random stuff happens yeah
Zariel Torgan 04:00:36 Mm-hmm
Cletus Cobbington 04:00:43 Gotcha. Kinda like the chaos curse. Gotcha, that's cool. I was like, okay, I'm just a little stressed out now, cool. Yeah, decompress. Gotcha.
Dungeon Master 04:00:59 No, they don't reset. They don't reset. And once you get to five, the first thing happens. In theory, Cletus has already had five at some point because you went from being humanoid to looking like a cow. But that's like part of, yeah, that's part of your history. We're not going to count that as like your active total.
Leopold Magnus 04:01:01 Give me some almond milk, you'll be all right. Almost there.
Cletus Cobbington 04:01:17 Farm life is hell of a business. Gotcha. Gotcha. Did he end up actually changing them for last session?
Dungeon Master 04:01:30 And then other than that, somebody's got to talk to Travis about maybe some offensive spells. He picked, I think, the ones he wanted, but he's got like a lot of adventuring type spells. He's got Tiny Hat, he's got Speak with Plan, he's got like Dispel Magic. But like, I went to go do it and I was like,
Leopold Magnus 04:01:39 because he doesn't have anything.
Kaladen Shash 04:01:42 I think, I think his, I don't think he was, I don't think he was ready for, I don't, yeah. Wow.
Cletus Cobbington 04:01:52 But they were probably very purposeful, so like, because now he thinks he's an adventurer. It's probably more just like... Yeah. It was probably that, and then...
Dungeon Master 04:02:01 Yeah, I was like looking through his stuff. He doesn't have a crossbow. He doesn't have a bow. He doesn't have any ranged spells. It just made it hard to keep him helpful.
Kaladen Shash 04:02:11 Yeah, he said he wasn't ready for a crawl, so I think the web like the spells he had picked, like you said, were a little more utilitarian and. Adventure hope and. He's got a good sword now. I did it, I'm doing a slashman.
Zariel Torgan 04:02:19 Yes, yes.
Cletus Cobbington 04:02:21 I wanted to play into the fact that true to character that he now sees himself as an adventurer, so he's going to be adventurous with spells. Versus like actually useful.
Dungeon Master 04:02:35 Oh, for sure. Travis is all about the method acting more than anything. Oh, yeah, where you were the girl.
Cletus Cobbington 04:02:38 You know what, that's what I did for the Dune one-shot we did with Jesse. I did fully everything that made my character funny, but then when I actually came to using her, was the worst character imaginable. Like, I think I failed every roll I rolled. It was fucking awful. I was like, well, this was all for flavor and it was not worth it because I didn't get to do anything.
Zariel Torgan 04:02:55 That's funny Ah
Leopold Magnus 04:02:56 That's great. Oh, that's terrible. Jennifer Taylor. That's fucking great.
Kaladen Shash 04:02:59 Oh, that's tough.
Cletus Cobbington 04:03:09 I'm just sitting there pissed the whole time. But... Yeah, good old Jennifer Talia. I was making a bossy bitch and it just fucking sucked.
Zariel Torgan 04:03:25 Oh, shit.
Leopold Magnus 04:03:31 Yeah, that's funny, but yeah, you can't do anything.

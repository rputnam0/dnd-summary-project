Cyrus Schwert 00:00:00 So.
Zariel Torgan 00:00:04 Is the little jingle different? Yeah. It's more like ascending, like ding-do-ding. This time it was like ding-do-do. It's like a producer tag.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:06 It did sound very different. I thought normally it just sounds like it. Put it on. It was just too busy fucking. Yeah. He gets one of those associate associate producers like roles or whatever.
Dungeon Master 00:00:07 I don't think so. I don't know. It's probably the same. Alrighty. Last session.
Kaladen Shash 00:00:19 Got that intro now.
Dungeon Master 00:00:36 picked up a few weeks ago with Zariel and Leopold searching out Pat's haberdashery. Patrick's haberdashery, if you will. Through the light, hazy morning of Moonhaven's constantly deflooding dome, you guys made your way towards the bottom to see that it was still underwater, under an unfortunate luck roll, but being...
Cyrus Schwert 00:00:42 So I'm curious.
Kaladen Shash 00:00:51 How about that, right?
Dungeon Master 00:01:05 automatons you just walked in anyway you found some great finds in there tricorn hat some bowler caps very specific requests for certain people um most of it deteriorated except for the one that zariel had found that like even though was technically beneficial really made him look like a douche um and then he made your way back super happy
Cyrus Schwert 00:01:19 Oh.
Kaladen Shash 00:01:29 I do remember that.
Zariel Torgan 00:01:30 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:01:32 And as you guys were making your way, you hit a certain point where you got that sort of inaudible tinnitus ringing sensation and veered off down the wrong direction.
Dungeon Master 00:01:45 And simultaneously, we had at camp, everybody waking up and getting ready for everything, some very well-placed, well, I hope they didn't get in trouble kind of conversations before sort of waiting around, tinkering around some random shit, working on your enchantments. We were like, let's just sort of reach out with our flower telepathic connection, realizing that just something wasn't working with it. You set out.
Dungeon Master 00:02:13 Found them eventually. A pretty intense battle ensued with a false Hadra. Bless you, sir. Pretty sure he just sneezed. Close calls on some ends. Frustrating mechanics that designed to make something hard for you guys being as powerful as you are. Ultimately, you guys were successful.
Dungeon Master 00:02:41 I forget how you fully killed it. I'll have to, like, read the very ending part. But, um... No, you definitely did. All I have to do is read it honestly. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 00:02:51 I think it ran away. I don't know if we actually ended up killing it.
Zariel Torgan 00:02:59 Yeah, we definitely killed it, and it was probably me. I definitely didn't spend the whole fight inside of its stomach doing nothing.
Kaladen Shash 00:03:04 uh,
Dungeon Master 00:03:09 It was a simultaneous strike from Cletus and Kaladin on their coordinated attack where they split it in the middle and it spun, bisected essentially, at the very end as it tried to get away.
Dungeon Master 00:03:31 And then we had it sort of fast-paced because I wanted to get to this last part that really mattered. You guys eventually connected the Teleportation Circle. You reactivated it to Nunu Arbor. Didn't use it, though. You then went in search of the altered rune set that you had tried to match up with stuff before finding that it went to a tree. You entered the runes not knowing where it was going to take you.
Dungeon Master 00:03:58 made some modifications and shunted yourself to what you learned is called the Ashen Grove.
Kaladen Shash 00:04:00 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 00:04:03 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:04:09 It is the area surrounding the Tree of Death in the far north. So we ended it with you guys standing at this cliff face with this small single story rackety shack behind you that had a rudimentary parchment map that sort of basically shows you what it looks like. In front of you there is this like
Dungeon Master 00:04:33 individually pretty sparse trees that surround the whole thing in a circle but it is such a vast amount of area that if you were in it it would seem impossibly dense and populated with trees and you would probably lose your way if not for the fact that you can track where you are at all times due to the massive tree that sort of erects into the atmosphere it's so large um
Kaladen Shash 00:04:59 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:04:59 there is a constant downpour of ash and snow that kind of mix sort of falling from a infinitely and eternally burning tree in the center somewhere. You don't know, but it sort of just rains down and you haven't got there yet, but you'll get there soon to describe you sort of are constantly walking through like knee deep ash and snow mixture. And it,
Dungeon Master 00:05:25 paints out a pretty grim scene in that you can always tell where somebody has moved or something has moved because when you step and you mix the ash and snow it goes from being white to like black and gray so it is a glass sheet of snow and ash in front of you undisturbed and as you guys would enter this area
Dungeon Master 00:05:46 your path would be marked out with all of your steps. So tracking is much easier here. You'll know pretty instantly if you're lost. You've got the tree in front, the cliffs behind you initially, this huge expanse of trees. And then from the starting point at the cliff,
Dungeon Master 00:06:01 The last thing you see is that there seems to be some sort of drop further and there seems to be a lot more like root vegetation, like large roots of the tree sort of crossing over and making this labyrinth type area. Like the next area would be you just haven't seen it yet. But, you know, huge treescape, something, something tree.
Dungeon Master 00:06:28 But we left it with you guys standing on the cliff face. It is pretty cold here. It is like more of a blistering cold where the temperature might be fine, but there's sort of a wind at this height and it sort of bites at the skin. It feels like there are just certain parts that are really dry and sharp.
Dungeon Master 00:06:47 You haven't necessarily bundled up. You've been in a tropical area. You didn't really expect to hit this. So maybe you back off and back into the cabin, get reacquainted, make a game plan. Again, inside the cabin is just a simple wooden table. In this shack, it's sort of inset to the ground a little bit for warmth.
Dungeon Master 00:07:06 So there's like a layer of dirt after the floorboards. I'm sorry, the walls end. And there is like a few pots set up like just old sleeping bags in a little frame that mark that like at one point this was an outpost, but it's not occupied anymore. And then there was that map that is the one I made on the tabletop. That's kind of what you guys look like. It's not super detailed. It's hand drawn out, but it gives you a sense of where to go.
Kaladen Shash 00:07:37 Jonathan, can you remind us of the ritual that was mentioned? Wait.
Dungeon Master 00:07:37 I'm so glad you asked because I made a point to copy and paste it into today's notes. Your ritual, the reminder of the rite that you had sort of imbued to you in that room, is it said at the source of death's life?
Zariel Torgan 00:07:47 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:07:59 They who would be crowned Lord must give to nourish the realm, must rest to dream of stars long diminished, and must give up their identity to be reborn in life's death with the breath of life and the twilight weave of the eternal court. And I can copy and paste that if you guys want.
Kaladen Shash 00:08:20 Oh, sweet. Okay. Through the tree.
Leopold Magnus 00:08:22 Yeah, I think I got to read that to take it in. That's deep.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:25 I got it. I would also like to take this moment to mention that I have transport via plants now. So we can go anywhere. Yeah, yeah. And so, I mean, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:08:28 Thanks. Thanks, dog. Hell yeah. So kind of better than teleport, but he just has to have the spell slot for it. I think it's maybe seven. Six or seven.
Kaladen Shash 00:08:51 Is that a six? What is that? Yeah. Okay. That's for circle.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:56 it's six yeah it's i just got okay it's oh yeah yeah so i can just like walk up to a tree
Dungeon Master 00:08:57 Because teleport is eight, and teleportation circle is fifth, right? Maybe teleport seven. He, as a druid... Oh, go ahead. This is your magic moment. This is such a good spell. ...
Leopold Magnus 00:09:04 So what does that spell?
Cyrus Schwert 00:09:15 This magic moment Whoa, that's fucking crazy.
Zariel Torgan 00:09:18 and like you know cut a little slice into it and it'll just kind of peel open and then you walk into that tree and then you can walk out of any tree of comparable size or big enough to fit the opening that i make so a tree in our dome that i yeah that i have seen before and we can just go there we could go home today
Dungeon Master 00:09:33 Any tree that he's ever seen, he can transport to. Mm-hmm. He could teleport to a tree in a specific backyard if you wanted to.
Leopold Magnus 00:09:38 Oh shit. So we could just like fucking go right through one of these trees back to the dome. Just get out of here and totally tank Jonathan's entire plan. Wow.
Cyrus Schwert 00:09:52 You can also teleport back.
Zariel Torgan 00:09:52 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's super helpful. But it's one of those things that looks like, well, we still have to plan. We can only do it once a day. So we can't get in and get out. Yeah, yeah, we can be sneaky. We can be sneaky, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:09:52 Yeah. That's all right. That's an easy way to get back to the city without being seen. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:10:06 can't be abused yet. It can be abused in the future. Good one too. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:09 Yeah. Oh, a hundred percent. Yeah. Jonathan. So you said that, did we teleport into this cabin? Is that we just stepped in the teleporter and landed right here.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:19 Anyway, so just I want to throw that out there because I was looking through my spells and I have that and I have a heal. It's another one I picked. Oh.
Kaladen Shash 00:10:27 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:10:34 This, no, there was a tree outside. You guys went through a transfer via plants, teleport via plants spell to get here. That was what it was based on. It was carved into a tree. So you walked out of a gnarled tree on sort of a stone bank behind the cabin. And it was just very then iconic that Zario would then learn that spell in your level of process. Like walking through it, he learned how to do it.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:45 Got it. OK. Yeah, that's pretty cool.
Cyrus Schwert 00:11:02 Wow.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:03 Yeah, that worked out pretty well. I know this. You don't have any...
Dungeon Master 00:11:05 That was cool. What did TJ say?
Leopold Magnus 00:11:09 Uh, I guess I'll turn to Zario. Oh, Zario, that wind is really wanging my antenna. And you can kind of see it just like, like, uh, my witch bolt antenna. That's, uh, and, uh, yeah, it was just like, what's that? I have a witch bolt, a witch bolt antenna. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:11:24 Yeah, this is new.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:31 You don't have an antenna on your head. Where's your antenna? When he gets real excited, it comes out. Yeah, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:11:35 is it always there or does it only come out when you cast witch bolt red you're gross dude
Leopold Magnus 00:11:43 Yeah, I want to kind of switch bolt, but I erected it. I erected it for comical impact.
Cyrus Schwert 00:11:44 It turns red once it comes out. You have to spray them with cold water. Sorry. Sorry. Yeah, that is true.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:04 He was talking to Mil-
Dungeon Master 00:12:06 Cletus... No, I made you sleep on cum. It's only fair. Cletus and Chip get physically farther away from using folder. You hear... You hear the nut in his... Like...
Kaladen Shash 00:12:11 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 00:12:18 You guys are the fucking nastiest ones here. I'm talking about tweetists. You don't want to be comfortable? You don't want to be comfortable. And that's fine. Perfect. There's a lot.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:21 Oh, what? Excuse me? I'm not sleeping on condensed, unrefined, moist spider silk. You're the one sleeping on that. Oh, the noise. Repulsive.
Dungeon Master 00:12:35 around, which is because of how moist it is in there. You hear the squish of it move from one cheek to the other. Keep thinking about it.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:43 There's too many moist things in this campaign. I'm going to carry around a little bag of sawdust just to keep things dry. It's too moist. I don't like it. So what do we...
Cyrus Schwert 00:12:49 There's a lot. Perfect.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:55 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:13:03 It's like mid-afternoon, probably 3 o'clock, but it's in late summer time, so you've got a while before nightfall. Nothing you know of. You had to get the water
Kaladen Shash 00:13:22 Jonathan, were there material needs for this ritual? Or is it just like show up to the tree? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:13:32 from the wellspring in Moonhaven. So you drink it. Zariel absorbed some without trying to. So there was some tie there where his body just sucked it up when he got close to it. And I believe Leopold grabbed a sample as well, but he didn't drink it either. You were the only one that has consumed it. And that is all you know, is that you need to do that
Dungeon Master 00:14:02 go to the tree of death and you would, you would realize the ritual when we got there. You don't know the name of it, but you, like I said, so you can see there is like a, a pretty vast expanse of
Kaladen Shash 00:14:03 And then go to the tree of ash. Okay, cool.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:10 Thanks.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:13 I see that we have a map, but we don't actually know where that shit is, right? We just see it. What can we see?
Dungeon Master 00:14:28 trees just like dead white um almost fossilized tree they're pretty sparse when you're like walking between them it's not like you're sort of bobbing weaving and threading but there's so many of them and it's such a large area that when you're in the forest and you look in any direction it's pretty much just tree and so you would kind of lose yourself if not for the fact that if you look up you can see the tree of death which is kind of the center of the whole thing
Dungeon Master 00:14:58 So you always have a general marker, but it's pretty disorienting once you get in there. The next area seems to be like where the tree base starts. It is like you see the roots coming out of the ground of the large tree, but it's too far away. And like the contrast on the dark, on the white of the tree and the snow and ashes, you can't tell the details of what it is. So, you know, there is this large forest across and then there is a next area. That is kind of how I explained it.
Kaladen Shash 00:15:05 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:29 Jonathan, you mentioned that it's easy to track yourself because you're disrupting the snow on the ath. But is there a certain amount of time that we need to be aware of in terms of how long it's going to be evident? Because if it's constantly snowing ash, won't those tracks get covered up over a certain period of time?
Dungeon Master 00:15:36 Eventually, yeah. But it's not coming down that hard. There is a gentle drift of...
Dungeon Master 00:15:58 Ash and snow. So like an overnight snowing kind of thing. Somebody walks down the street. You see the indentation of their footprints for like the whole night. Next morning, they're gone. Same concept. There's some point it would disappear. But a lot of it is the discoloration, too. So it's not just, you know, impress me deep treads as you guys are marching through. You'd have to fill those whole treads.
Leopold Magnus 00:16:08 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:16:22 And then enough would have to cover it that you wouldn't see the black. So it is pretty easy to track yourself in that sense. But at least the first area just seems like disorienting with you're always looking into like a white expanse, white trees, white ash, white snow. Hazy sort of white clouds cover the whole area. It's hard to make details out.
Leopold Magnus 00:16:43 That makes a lot of sense. The other question I had is, so if we go to the center landmark, the Tree of Death, would it be fair to say we wouldn't necessarily have a landmark to get back? Okay. Okay. Cool. That was all.
Dungeon Master 00:16:51 You would be able to see the cliff that you're on right now if you were high enough on the tree that you could just look up at it. Or you guys develop a way where you all just fly and you can bypass the whole thing and get an aerial view and then it doesn't matter as much.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:21 Yep.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:22 So do we get the impression that we're headed there? Or are we trying to complete this ritual? Yeah, that's like our. OK.
Cyrus Schwert 00:17:23 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:17:33 Heading where? That's the end. That's the location no matter what.
Kaladen Shash 00:17:36 We have to go to the tree of death to do the ritual. Yeah. It's one and it's one in the same. Yeah. Jonathan, are we aware of any other sort of sense of civilization up here? Like there's a cabin. Do we have an understanding that there were once towns scattered through this region or is it, do we didn't do anything?
Cyrus Schwert 00:17:56 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:18:03 Give me an intelligence check. 12. As far as Kaladin, Kaladin's like 112 or something. Crazy. Yeah, but he's been around long enough that you would have gathered a lot of little stories. You know generally that
Kaladen Shash 00:18:16 He's not that old for now.
Dungeon Master 00:18:33 Only in the earliest days of like inhabitants on this continent did people travel around. And then it was like they sequestered into the domes. And once that was established, traveling outside of the dome was seen as dangerous. That's like the general knowledge didn't happen because it wasn't allowed.
Leopold Magnus 00:18:36 Stop.
Dungeon Master 00:18:54 You have knowledge from a second source, which is Zariel's weird memory dreams, where he overheard a conversation of somebody telling him that they were traveling outside of the dome, but not to tell anybody. So you know it's not allowed. You have somebody who says they've seen it happen. That's kind of where Kaladin's at with the 12. I don't think I infer anything for you at that point.
Kaladen Shash 00:18:54 All right.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:23 Well, should we start heading that way? When was the last long rest? We didn't long rest after that fight, did we? We just kind of just went. Because I'm missing, like. Well, I healed up everybody. Yeah, I did a mass secure wounds. So everybody should be decent.
Cyrus Schwert 00:19:27 Yeah, let's do it. Yeah, a lot of us are at full. Yeah, I'm at full personally.
Dungeon Master 00:19:28 Yeah, how do you guys lead this off? No. You just went. Yeah, you guys... Cletus did his totem. You guys did some spells. The plan was to get here, take a look, and then long rest as needed. It's just...
Kaladen Shash 00:19:36 No, but someone definitely healed me. I'm almost full. There's lots of healing. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:39 Oh, yeah. And we did we level up? I don't think I did. I was gonna say,
Dungeon Master 00:19:58 I mean, if you guys scan the whole expanse, there is, like, very little evidence of life. You see some birds. That's kind of it. Like, maybe you see a hare or something. It doesn't seem like there's any large predators that you can... I mean, it's hard to see at a glance, right? But it doesn't look like there's a lot of life up here. It seems pretty desolate. You know from something you had actually read. I forgot about this. Um...
Cyrus Schwert 00:20:12 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:20:24 that there is like a general effect on the area from the tree of death that like healing spells aren't as effective. And there are like long-term effects to your health being out here. So it makes sense that natural life would just kind of die. So I forgot the actual question at this point, but that's the answer I have.
Zariel Torgan 00:20:34 Oh yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:20:57 I was going to say, did we level up from the last session? Oh. OK. I was just going to say, I don't think I rolled a hit dice. OK, so we should roll hit dice now before we forget, right?
Dungeon Master 00:20:59 Yeah, you hit 11 after that fight. You just hadn't technically taken the long rest yet. I love the little bit more video game level up logic where it just happens. No, nobody rolled hit dice this time, I don't think. Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:22 We can, I guess, yeah. I might have actually done that as well. Let me check. I'm at 108.
Cyrus Schwert 00:21:24 I did already. I don't think you were either.
Leopold Magnus 00:21:25 Oh, you did?
Kaladen Shash 00:21:28 Let me double check. I think I rolled in front of everybody. Because I'm up at 101. I don't think I was above.
Dungeon Master 00:21:34 I wrote it down previously. You guys leveled up in session 30, and you pre-leveled your stuff then. Everybody told me what they were doing when they did it and rolled it if they wanted to, but I said at the very end of the session that you guys were leveling up, so I don't know that we did anything today.
Cyrus Schwert 00:22:00 I did it today when you said something.
Leopold Magnus 00:22:00 Yeah, I was just looking for rolls, and I didn't. All right. And then your hit dice is just whatever that D is given by your. And that is, I was going to do an artifice there. So is that D8? D8? Yeah, because I'm.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:04 Maybe not, actually. I think it might have been at 108, so I'll roll real quick.
Dungeon Master 00:22:06 It is for the class. What are you taking? An eight? Or maybe art of precision six? No, I think it's eight. I think the only C6 is there. Sorceress and wizard.
Cyrus Schwert 00:22:29 wizard and yeah
Leopold Magnus 00:22:31 I'll roll a d8. Ah, that's average. I'll take it.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:33 A nice.
Kaladen Shash 00:22:39 Hey, there we go. Yes, indeed.
Dungeon Master 00:22:39 six, four, eight. That makes me think you took with a fighter again. Nice. Nice. OK.
Dungeon Master 00:23:02 So yes, it is mid-afternoon, not nighttime yet. You guys have not long rested yet. You don't see any immediate threats other than just like the weather isn't super pleasant. And you guys were in a weather-controlled dome, teleported to a warm region, went into a tropical dome. You probably, as individuals, are not super acquainted with how cold it is. But that's like the only immediate thing parsing your vibe at all.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:39 As we move towards the Tree of Death, is it getting closer like we would expect? It's not. Oh, I thought we did.
Dungeon Master 00:23:47 Have you guys started walking towards it yet? You were going to, but then you were like, I'm missing hit points and a bunch of shit. Did we long rest? We got distracted with the level up. So yes, you guys sort of come off the cliff face down the jagged steps. You enter into the forest and you guys walk. And as you guys walk, then we do some ability checks.
Cyrus Schwert 00:23:51 Just now.
Dungeon Master 00:24:14 This area is known as the Sharwood from the map. Makes sense from everything you're looking at. But as you guys are moving through, I'll need three survival checks, three successes before three failures. And at least one person has to do it each time. That's not the same.
Dungeon Master 00:24:37 So first leg, yeah, I've got all you guys' character pages. Really cool thing with Chrome is I've got into making groups. And then you can just expand or collapse them whenever you need it. So all of your character sheets loaded, and then I just collapse it when I don't get it. I'm automating my life one step at a time.
Cyrus Schwert 00:24:38 Do you have Cletus's stats pulled up too? I feel like his are not. I only have a plus two for survival, so it's probably not Cyrus this time. Unless everybody's is bad, and then I don't mind.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:38 I've got a plus nine. Nice. I think Pelitas and I probably have the best.
Kaladen Shash 00:25:03 I'm just plus two so I'll hold
Dungeon Master 00:25:08 Pretty good one. Yeah. Yeah. Who wants it? 28. Um,
Zariel Torgan 00:25:15 Yeah, I got a plus nine. Okay. I'll roll. That's going to be a 28.
Cyrus Schwert 00:25:15 Okay, so we'll do Zerial and Cletus first, and then we'll see where we're at. Go ahead, Zerial. You're doing it.
Dungeon Master 00:25:29 No problem at all. You guys have pretty good reference for the first area. So for the first couple of hours, you know, three to five-ish, you guys walk unencumbered, unhindered, unhindered. And you guys aren't super fatigued marching through the snow either. You got a good order. Weather's not a big deal. Really good first roll. Cletus will go second, sort of taking the lead once. Sorry, leads a break.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:01 Do we notice anything odd? Any weird sounds or any life? I mean, I would imagine by the tree of death, there's not much life, but. Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:26:02 a lot of orvids crows, ravens not a lot of other bird species very eerily quiet it just like it's got an eerie sensation at all times like constantly being watched
Cyrus Schwert 00:26:14 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:26:32 Don't ever see anything, but like no actual dangers. A lot of it is just anxiety driven, like just an invisible pressure you feel from the area. Kalina's got a natural 20. So you guys just cross the whole thing and you guys will hit evening like eight o'clock and it is as you hit the next area, which is called the Ember Wake area.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:43 Gotcha.
Dungeon Master 00:26:59 crossing and i'll just throw it to the next map as you guys get there um you see it um in like general before you actually get there like from a distance more of it becomes available you were walking through these trees and you can tell that like the physical biomatter that the tree consumed to get as big as it did has like carved out the ground around it
Dungeon Master 00:27:29 But all of the branches and roots and stuff have overtaken it. So you have these huge sort of crevasses and drops of just nothing. It disappears into a fog bank at the bottom and roots crossing over and everything.
Dungeon Master 00:27:46 And as you're walking by with the natural 20, it's an incredibly dense bramble to the next area. You have to find a very specific spot. No extra check needed. You guys sort of...
Dungeon Master 00:28:01 tank through the snow until you hit this like black root that's covered with ash that bridges over the gap at like a shallow enough level that it hits the bank that you're on and you see these like incredibly old herma enchanted torches and fire pits at like the front of it with like this tattered banner that's sort of just whipping it back and forth in the wind that kind of marks a safe place to cross
Dungeon Master 00:28:29 And this is like as you hit Nightfall. So you've got the forest at your back, the crossing in front of you. You guys can push through. You guys can stay where you are. Totally up to you. But that is... No, it's just you walk up and it looks like at one point it was colored and then...
Leopold Magnus 00:28:43 Is there anything written on the banners? Or is there any distinguishing marks, just flags?
Kaladen Shash 00:28:46 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:28:54 The color faded with time and then it was a white flag and the white flag soaked through once it lost like its new enchantment and protections over time that it like from the bottom up is soaked up like the black and gray of the ash. So it's just like this really gross rag in the wind at this point.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:13 Yes.
Cyrus Schwert 00:29:18 Okay. I feel like we don't see any tracks in front of us, like someone has walked this way recently. Or do we? I suppose. Okay. I don't think it's going to matter. Starting off hot.
Dungeon Master 00:29:25 Give me a perception check. You can.
Kaladen Shash 00:29:31 Can I assist with that? That's not going to matter one bit.
Dungeon Master 00:29:46 Kaladin you have to catch Cyrus from like stepping off an area that he didn't realize wasn't not his fault this is not clean stupidity it's like snow that had covered a gap just careful enough that he steps into it and he like kind of just tumbles forward and you reach out and you grab and you pull him back by his choker to save his life and you keep walking I didn't say that part
Cyrus Schwert 00:29:57 I'm glad I'm wearing tight pants.
Kaladen Shash 00:30:11 He liked that a little too much.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:11 Mm hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:30:16 Everybody else sees it but Cyrus. And within that one, you'll continue to not see it. But it's pretty obvious when you get there, you just don't see it ahead of time. As you step up to like the large root, even in the darkness, you've lost most of your sunlight, but you've got that sort of just general brightness that you have in the wintertime in the snow. You see there are like faded steps on the root system.
Zariel Torgan 00:30:22 Ah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:30:41 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:30:47 kind of lazy and irregular and gate and they like almost all of them seem to veer off of the route to the side over the crevice so like all of them kind of go forward get sluggish and then different sides at different lengths disappear over the side cyrus you don't see anything and then you guys um
Zariel Torgan 00:31:10 Can I ask a quick question? What are the odds that you'll be charitable enough to have allowed me to go back and get those dogs that I left at the edge of the city?
Cyrus Schwert 00:31:10 Yeah, I got that.
Leopold Magnus 00:31:13 Are we at the camp?
Dungeon Master 00:31:16 Yeah, so you guys can set up camp. Let me know if you're doing anything for your night. And then we will go to the next morning once you had your long rest. Yes.
Cyrus Schwert 00:31:40 There's no chance.
Leopold Magnus 00:31:43 They're on an auto feeder. Don't worry. We set them up. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:31:46 Yes.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:49 They're in really good conditions.
Dungeon Master 00:31:53 you know for certain in your heart of heart that they as werewolf bred wolf dogs have probably chewed through the stone cage at this point in search of food as it's been like three or four days of just getting like little portions from the glutton's fork dispensed until it runs out of charges I make it
Leopold Magnus 00:32:15 That's got to be more food than just like, you know, you know, that's a decent amount, right? Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:17 You make it sound like a bad situation. No. Yeah. I don't know how good they got it. Damn it.
Dungeon Master 00:32:24 I could kill them on screen if you want. You'll meet them again, but I'm not going to make you carry them around in all these situations. They'll come back into your lives at some point. They're still your nat 20 werewolf pups, but it just would not work for the next section.
Cyrus Schwert 00:32:26 There's starving dogs in Africa that would love that food.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:52 All right. That makes me feel a little better because I 100% forgot when we left last time. I was so enamored with my fuckboy hat.
Leopold Magnus 00:33:01 that's good I guess is there any obvious signs of life around this camp or this is an eternal flame that's just been burning for eons like nothing alive
Dungeon Master 00:33:09 Just two small campfires that just have a simple cantrip enchantment in like the rocks of just like create bonfire that just like sputter and keep the area melted immediately around it, but it doesn't prevent it from getting covered mostly in ash. So it's just like this little tiny starting fire thing.
Cyrus Schwert 00:33:27 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:33:38 No other signs of anything. Like I said, it's the basic enchantments, the tattered rags, and the eerily mysterious footprints that fall to death on the root system. And a lot of crows in the general area. Not like suspiciously large amount, but when you pay attention, you're like, yeah, I only really see a certain kind of bird here.
Cyrus Schwert 00:34:07 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:34:10 We'll tell it in this place is giving me the creeps. Do you? Do you feel weird out by this area? Oh, my bones. But anyone want to play some cards by the campfire?
Kaladen Shash 00:34:18 But don't feel anything right now. Walk long distance. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:34:24 Nothing specific. We'll make you roll for something that's not there. Okay, we're trying to...
Zariel Torgan 00:34:29 Hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 00:34:40 Yes. Yes, I do. I've had a long day of walking. My Nikes were not made for walking in snow. The fucking suede is all stained now. It's all fucked. And unless Cletus puts down his fucking tree, I'm going to be sleeping on cum again. So I've got a lot of gripes with today.
Kaladen Shash 00:34:53 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:34:55 giving yourself Nike. Cletus absolutely puts out his tree. The enchanted willow dome pops up. You guys have your
Zariel Torgan 00:35:03 say that like you don't want that
Leopold Magnus 00:35:03 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:35:07 Look at my hair.
Dungeon Master 00:35:18 campfire card game in the night um are you guys taking rest at all uh to monitor the outside you know that nothing can enter it so you're safe mechanically but um new area don't know if you guys want to do something specific otherwise moving on
Zariel Torgan 00:35:35 I only need four hours of sleep, so I wouldn't mind staying up like the middle of the night, like a couple hours in boot up and just, just keep an eye out. Just watch.
Dungeon Master 00:35:50 Cool. And then also Leopold has a sentry mode. So he's like subconsciously watching everything at all times. And he has the ability to come out unsurprised in certain actions. But he can't do anything if he wants to be in a long rest. But he can monitor too. Okay. It is...
Leopold Magnus 00:35:52 I was gonna. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:36:03 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:08 Well I wanted to try to eat some spiders if I could.
Kaladen Shash 00:36:14 It's been a while since I had some good ones.
Dungeon Master 00:36:17 the quiet of the night, your fellow party mates sleeping, some soundlessly, some not. There's the crackle of the fire. There's like a gentle breeze that kind of always billows through the willow to make them sway a little bit. So you've got a little bit of the sound of the rustling leaves.
Dungeon Master 00:36:37 the little illuminations of the fireflies. They're like ethereal and magical, not actually there. And Zariel is hunched over looking for spiders to eat. Give me an animal handling check to see if you can find some spiders. This is a vlog.
Cyrus Schwert 00:36:55 You should rub your hands on the spider silk pillow or something and see if it attracts them. I could take it out of my Ziploc. Well, I didn't want to get the rest of my bag all goopy. It's going to make a mess. Well, not today, but yeah, in general.
Leopold Magnus 00:37:03 Do you keep it ziplocked? Do you take it out to sleep on? Because you can just leave it in the zip. That's great.
Zariel Torgan 00:37:04 Oh, no.
Dungeon Master 00:37:08 like a my pillow just like the cube one uh seven it
Kaladen Shash 00:37:08 So gross.
Dungeon Master 00:37:26 Takes you a while. You don't really see any in the magical dome, but you look outside of the dome and on a tree, you see like a spider web set up between the branch and the trunk perfectly and almost cartoonishly in like design. But it is outside of the dome. You dink it.
Cyrus Schwert 00:37:26 I'm a very light sleeper.
Zariel Torgan 00:37:47 I will go out and I will.
Dungeon Master 00:37:54 Glad you left the dome. You hear like cracking of trees in the distance, like something is moving towards you slowly, lumbering almost, but there's not a lot of sound. Pretty far off at this point, and you don't... Give me a perception check. You don't see anything to start with. Nothing quick. It doesn't feel like something is sprinting at you. It's not an immediate threat, but it definitely catches your ear. 19. Um...
Zariel Torgan 00:38:19 19.
Dungeon Master 00:38:23 sort of hearing this and you've got the spider and it's like as you pull it to your mouth to start chewing on it kind of like peering and um there's like a like a kind of sickly green pale light
Dungeon Master 00:38:36 pretty far away and kind of high up at the source of the sound. And it's an odd thing. You get a pretty good outline eventually with the general white background. It makes it easier to see. There is a large shape.
Dungeon Master 00:38:55 It seems like it's somewhat elevated in the sky. You can't really see anything below it, but you hear lumbering footsteps. So you know there's like legs in theory, like something moving this through the trees. But you mostly see there's like this huge block of shape and a green light. And that's kind of all you get at first. I want to give you a chance to do something and not just wait.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:20 And. Would I get the vibe that this thing is unfriendly or I mean, it's so far away, I can't get anything like that from from this. Well, usually friendly creatures have a sickly green light, so probably probably good by selling Girl Scout cookies.
Cyrus Schwert 00:39:27 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:39:34 Nothing at first, nothing at this stage. I forgot that it was Pletus that had this. So as a general reminder, there was a point in time
Dungeon Master 00:39:58 When Cletus died and he told everybody that he felt like he was teleported to a large expanse of white snow and ash and trees, and he saw a cabin in the woods that felt like it was drawing him to it. And it had legs. Was it you? I couldn't remember. Somebody died.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:14 Oh, shit. And it had legs. Yeah. Yeah, I forgot about that. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:40:17 Wait, wasn't that when I died? Right, because you guys went to loot. And I was in the midst of the death stage, and you guys went to loot, and then I fucking died. And then that happened, I think. Yeah. It looked like...
Cyrus Schwert 00:40:33 Sounds about right.
Dungeon Master 00:40:36 Okay, it was Leopold then. So Leopold's there and could tell you if you asked him, but yes. You wouldn't be able to tell. Yeah, it looks like the ancient witch of the woods that you heard about from the little woodland creatures in Cottonwood that told you that she has a cabin that wanders the world on large chicken legs.
Kaladen Shash 00:40:37 priorities, priorities. What are you going to do?
Leopold Magnus 00:40:41 It looked a lot like the Hags cabin. Yeah, I remember that.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:02 Now, would you say that it would be metagaming for me to remember any of that? Was it shared with the group? Hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 00:41:03 The stuff in Cottonwood, we definitely heard that.
Dungeon Master 00:41:11 I don't know. I'll give Rex a chance to see if he told it or not. You did let him die. You also heard a similar story from the old portal Cornelius. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:11 I thought that yeah I mean I think that after that happened I kind of like shot up you had resuscitated me and I just went oh dear the hag and I think that's pretty much all you got
Kaladen Shash 00:41:13 And yeah. Mm hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 00:41:33 We heard the information in cottonwood though, right? Yeah. We were all there for that. Are the lumbering footprints on the root chicken shaped?
Zariel Torgan 00:41:38 Yeah. Well... I'm gonna...
Dungeon Master 00:41:42 But he didn't tell you the whole thing. He just told you he was saved by, like, an ancient hag. No. They're not. They're very distinctly humanoid. And you know that the chicken legs are...
Leopold Magnus 00:41:49 I just knocked. I think I didn't even fully open the door.
Cyrus Schwert 00:42:02 Okay. Got it.
Dungeon Master 00:42:10 Like, enormous. They are as thick as trees around, and the feeder is bigger than a person. The crackling of trees indicates the size of it.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:22 I'm going to use one of my wild shapes. I'm going to turn into an air elemental. I'm just going to fly. I'm just going to get a little closer. I want to see, because I can go pretty fast as an elemental. So I just want to get up and close and see if I can see something.
Dungeon Master 00:42:40 yeah um i won't make you burn your wild shape out of combat and because of what's going to happen with it as you're in your air elemental form and you're moving towards it you get really high at first and from the view top down and the backdrop that you know have the the visualization of it becomes much more clear there is this ancient shack
Dungeon Master 00:43:04 It looks almost pieced together of different wooden structures and like stitched into place. There is a green lantern that just hangs from the porch that swings back and forth and it gives off this pale green light. And these dinosaur sized like like purely dry skin chicken legs.
Dungeon Master 00:43:27 like lumber through the trees, but they're not causing any damage. It's like the trees that they hit bend and back out of their way. Once it's out of the way, like it is moving through the forest without destroying anything. And you're looking at it and it's coming towards you at an even pace, just sort of lumbering back and forth. And it hits a point where you start to feel this pressure of this, this,
Leopold Magnus 00:43:33 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:43:53 truly primordial evil this like old world magic dipped in black ichor washes over your soul and a crow uh like explodes in front of your face cawing and spreading its wings and you lose your enchantment and drop your wild shape and plummet to the ground not taking any damage but falling back as you are like
Kaladen Shash 00:43:59 Good morning.
Dungeon Master 00:44:17 forced out of your magical form in its presence and then the cabin keeps lumbering past you not paying you any attention before it gets invisible range of the hut and you see the legs of the hut kind of squat and fold in on itself and the whole hut settles into the ground unevenly kind of crooked and sitting back a little bit
Dungeon Master 00:44:44 And it's just in front of the dome, like we'll say 50 paces or so. But you are farther than that back now. So we'll say you're like 60 or 70 paces back. It is sort of in front of you. And then the dome is a little bit farther.
Leopold Magnus 00:45:03 I did look up the quote from when I saw the hag, and I think it's fairly pertinent. And I said, oh, Zariel, you're trying to find the hag. You just have to edge me a bit. Beat me up real good, you know? I found the hag while I was off dying, so all you have to do is really put me down. That's what I said after I saw the hag.
Dungeon Master 00:45:25 that's funny you do say that all the time though he's not a child he just has childlike reactions to things
Zariel Torgan 00:45:27 I do remember that now. Yeah. I remember your character says stuff like that, and I'm like, aren't you a child? And it's very disturbing.
Leopold Magnus 00:45:39 Bye-bye.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:49 I'll take a wide berth, and all the while I just want to be looking and listening, see if I see anything. I want to get back into the group and obviously let everybody know that shit's out there, but it seems to be waiting for us to rest.
Cyrus Schwert 00:45:53 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:46:05 Yeah, you kind of skirt around it a little bit and you hit a point where you can like go back into under the leaves of the dome. Doesn't react, seems just inert at the moment. Just that pale green glow is like basking the snow in front of you, bouncing off the trees. Got a pretty good image to it, but no danger from it. Just that kind of unsettling presence.
Dungeon Master 00:46:33 When you had forced to weigh in under magical means and you tried to get too close, you were like repelled by something enchanting the cabin or the space. You don't feel that at like a non-confrontational moment. So just as creepy. So you can go back into the dome and wait if you would like. You can wake everybody up. The party has not gotten a long rest. It is middle of the night at this point.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:34 Hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 00:46:48 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:47:00 We'll say like in three hours into the rest so far. Okay. You all.
Zariel Torgan 00:47:05 I'll just wait. Leo's in sentry mode, so I'll just kind of like, hey, keep an eye on that. And then I'll wait. I want everybody to be prepared. I want to wake everybody up half ready to rock.
Dungeon Master 00:47:29 can take your long rest and get the benefits of your level up in your new hit points. But very targeted and very specifically, we'll go in order just on my Discord screen, top to bottom, left to right. I've got Cyrus first in my screen. What does Cyrus hold most dear, tangible or intangible?
Cyrus Schwert 00:48:03 Give me a moment. Almonds, obviously. My compila, no.
Dungeon Master 00:48:10 Okay. I don't know who Cletus is, so he'll have to be his successful almond business. It's having Chip. What is Kaladin's most valued thing, tangible or intangible?
Leopold Magnus 00:48:18 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:48:18 um and it's what i value not like not like value and i would say
Dungeon Master 00:48:42 Yeah, you could say Kaladin takes pride in his arcane ability or his martial prowess or his pride or his good looks or whatever. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:48:47 I was going to say, I think it's how he's been able to continue to harness the curse. I think he's been enjoying and really values his ability to continue to push how he can harness or gain new abilities with the curse. So kind of the arcane prowess. Yeah, just up to this point.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:53 It is.
Dungeon Master 00:49:16 What is, okay, what is Cyrus's? Nice.
Cyrus Schwert 00:49:17 have an answer now i think at this point in cyrus's life he's he most values the new crew that he's with and being part of a group that feels to accept him and like values his uniqueness yeah
Dungeon Master 00:49:39 Okay. Two of the group. What is Leopold value tangible or intangible most?
Leopold Magnus 00:49:49 yeah i i along the same lines of cyrus i was going to say friendship uh in a sense that leopold as far as he can remember just existed within the last like few months but it's kind of been getting bombarded with these fragments that don't really feel like he ever belonged or that he was like part of something he just was kind of a tool and so i think leopold is really valuing kind of that connection with his adventuring mates because
Kaladen Shash 00:50:06 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:50:19 To his previous knowledge, he never really had that opportunity.
Dungeon Master 00:50:24 Okay. And what is, um, czar real value most?
Zariel Torgan 00:50:33 Probably a combination of acceptance, but probably to a greater extent, his utility. He was always there just to be a helper, but being formidable, being able to protect himself, being able to protect his friends makes him feel powerful, makes him feel like he belongs, like he earns his spot in the group.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:04 I still need to bring you the table.
Dungeon Master 00:51:06 Okay. Cletus values is obviously an almond empire, but his close relationships, his connection to nature, his uniqueness as a being, we'll say. And collectively, without going unnecessarily into it, your characters have dreams about that thing.
Kaladen Shash 00:51:07 through.
Dungeon Master 00:51:32 unprompted in the way that it manifests to those characters most you all have dreams even the robots of the group about you know a physical or visual or mental manifestation of the thing that you valued whether it was memories of Kaladin learning how to be better or when your first curse manifestation you know when you really pushed yourself to do something extra in combat and
Dungeon Master 00:52:01 Cyrus is developing powers, making him one of the most formidable martial fighters in the group. But the fact that you have this group to go on adventures on, something you didn't have so recently. Leopold has these memories and then mixes of the memories of the group and then memories of the past that doesn't make sense to him and the memories of the group reinforcing it.
Dungeon Master 00:52:23 And Zardo's got his utility and what he can bring and his reliability and the party and everything. And it's harmless. It's nothing bad attached to it, but it feels in the environment that you're in, like almost like an omen. You all wake up with a sense of dread about what you know is next to come. And you know, no matter what that you guys are walking up to the door of that cabin and knocking,
Leopold Magnus 00:52:29 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:52:53 Just a matter of when. So as you all... Is that Razzle or is that Arlo? Huge. He just wants to play D&D. Roll for initiative. I kill Arlo.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:58 Ha ha ha ha ha.
Leopold Magnus 00:53:00 That's Arlo. He didn't want to hang out, so I had to pick him up. Yeah. He's a good boy. He's a formidable paladin. Better watch out.
Kaladen Shash 00:53:06 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:53:11 And.
Dungeon Master 00:53:22 Anyway, you guys have your morning to you.
Dungeon Master 00:53:31 At the eighth hour, the dome will collapse automatically. So you have until then, and you're back in the elements. You can prep however you want, make a game plan. The preface that you all have to understand going into this is that you will have a chance to talk with a creature known as the Baba Yaga, a, like,
Kaladen Shash 00:53:44 Dr.
Dungeon Master 00:53:53 mythical legendary hack like a creature that like exists in every single fairy tale to some extent it is woven into the fabric of reality but it's still somehow non-tangible and it's just a myth it's a legend um that creature is in front of you so
Dungeon Master 00:54:15 Going in with a plan on somebody or something that has made a legacy off of trickery and truth set a cost. It would be reckless to go in without a concept of what you were willing to bargain necessarily, you know.
Leopold Magnus 00:54:35 I was going to say, didn't, didn't you give me one specific piece of advice? Cause we talked to the shaman, the turtle was his name. Cornelius. I think, uh, didn't I ask him one piece of advice if we ever talked to the hag say I was something like, don't lie to her along those lines, I think.
Dungeon Master 00:54:45 I can check my Cottonwood notes, but I don't remember off the top of my head. It's, yeah, kind of like, what's the point in lying to a creature that knows the truth? You know?
Zariel Torgan 00:54:45 I think it was.
Cyrus Schwert 00:54:46 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:55:09 Right, yeah. So we have to be clever in the way we use our words. If we're telling the truth, but maybe not the full truth, that might be a good approach. Maybe better than just flat out lying. She needed those 23 herbs and spices, man.
Zariel Torgan 00:55:26 Well, I think it also, didn't he also say to bring her a Dr. Pepper? Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:55:33 It was something like that.
Cyrus Schwert 00:55:35 The Snickers. You're not you when you're hungry. I fucking drank it, dude. I drank it last night.
Dungeon Master 00:55:38 I don't remember. I don't remember at all. I want to say no, but the reality is I say dumb shit like that all the time when it's like mid-session and I've smoked too much. So it is entirely possible that I said bring her a cold one, you know.
Leopold Magnus 00:55:44 racks a cold one open.
Zariel Torgan 00:55:58 for breakfast I would like to well I'll talk to the group I guess maybe we would have had this discussion the night before what do you guys think about alright what do you guys think about a
Dungeon Master 00:56:14 Yes, you guys have a chance to get things out of the way. And I'll let you guys do that right now. I'm going to go check in with Anna real quick. So make your plan. Prep your stuff. Also remember, Cletus has to hand out his magical almond. So somebody
Cyrus Schwert 00:56:21 That's mostly HP.
Zariel Torgan 00:56:32 What do you guys think about a hero's feast? Do you think that's warranted, or do you think that'd be kind of a waste? I thought so too, but I have a feeling I think so too, but it's got other elements that are helpful. If you look,
Leopold Magnus 00:56:42 What is that? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, definitely.
Kaladen Shash 00:56:43 I don't... Do you think this is going to be a fight with the hag? I thought we were just going to talk to this lady. So, like, just being able to resist or, like, buffs for, like, saving check roll, whatever. Is that what you're saying? I'm fine. Let's buff it out. I mean, these heroes...
Cyrus Schwert 00:56:53 I think it's more troll under the bridge riddle situation. Might as well. Ooh. Yeah, that makes sense.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:07 Yeah, so it says you're immune to poison. You're immune to being frightened. Advantage on all wisdom saving throws.
Kaladen Shash 00:57:16 Yeah. I like to frighten. That's a weak one for me. I feel like she's going to, there could be some types of magic or checks that need to be passed, you know, that may enhance our ability to engage how we want to with her. So I think that could be really helpful.
Cyrus Schwert 00:57:24 I mean, yeah, then we should probably send that. That would make sense. For sure.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:41 Yeah, that was my thought. Alright. The only element of that that would be interesting is that I wouldn't be able to do transport via plants today. Alright, so outside on the ground a large banquet table appears.
Kaladen Shash 00:57:50 I don't think that's going to be an issue. We can camp overnight until next dawn just to get a long rest and teleport the next day once we feel like we're settled or ready.
Leopold Magnus 00:57:55 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:08 It's got about 12 to 15 feet long. And there's a little two-foot section for every member of the party. And it has exactly what they would like the most. And it takes an hour to consume. And so everybody can eat. And then you get another 2d10 maximum hit points increase for the length of 24 hours. So for 24 hours, your maximum hit point increases
Cyrus Schwert 00:58:23 consume. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:38 by 2D10. Interesting.
Leopold Magnus 00:58:40 Nice. I also read up a little bit on the hag here. And she's been known to be cruel and twisted, offering one-handed deals and bargains, but also has an empathy for preserving nature. So Cornelius described her as the most powerful woman he ever met. And the story suggests that she might present you what you want to see. Cornelius saw her as an elderly tortle.
Cyrus Schwert 00:59:07 Hmm.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:20 Do we have anything we want from this thing?
Leopold Magnus 00:59:24 I feel like she's going to offer us something and we have to make a decision as to whether or not we want to take it. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:59:31 Right, but is there a need for one of us to speak to her for some plot line or personal story promotion? Who's... Or does she assist us in like... Yes, I'm saying. So we just heard of her early, early in the campaign. And then your near death brought you to another experience. And now here we see it. Is that our sort of interactions? Right.
Cyrus Schwert 00:59:43 Not that I'm aware of.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:56 Mm hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:57 She's been coming through. Yeah, we, I think, first heard about her through Wesley. Wesley briefly mentioned. Yeah. So I'm not certain. Yeah, I think that she might want something or might offer us something. So we should be maybe ready to appeal to her fondness of nature. Maybe we could come at it from that angle. I don't know.
Kaladen Shash 01:00:02 Yeah, like really early.
Cyrus Schwert 01:00:30 Yeah, what are we looking to get out of this? Like, I don't know what our goal of talking to this person is. I mean, what do we need help with right now?
Zariel Torgan 01:00:33 I don't think... I think it's going to be like... Yeah. I don't... Well, I think
Kaladen Shash 01:00:43 I forget. Does she give us information on how we might be able to manage something? I just don't remember if there's a plot line that we haven't remembered. I mean, maybe she...
Leopold Magnus 01:00:57 I don't think there was anything specific. Yeah. The one thing that is mentioned is that she finds you when you are the most desperate. There is a quote in here. Finding the hag isn't something you do through conventional means, rather something that happens to you often when you're in a state of desperation, lost, near death, or within a domain like the forest of death. I think it just kind of happened. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:22 So we're in the force of it. So maybe, well, maybe this, maybe she can help us to understand why this place is completely dead or how it got to be here. And if, and if taking the water that we have, or if she knows anything about some sort of ceremony that can be performed, or maybe we even ask her like, Hey, what are these words mean? Right. We've got the, we got what the sort of cryptic riddle was.
Leopold Magnus 01:01:33 yeah yeah the what two for a wedding whatever thing that we've been finding
Cyrus Schwert 01:01:50 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:58 Oh, no, no, no. I'm talking about like with the... Like Jonathan Redis. Did he send it in the chat? I didn't even check. I didn't. It's worth... Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:06 Oh, that's right. Yeah, yeah. Let me read that.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:10 Well, and we got to remember that anything we get from her, there's going to be a cost. So we have to decide whether or not it's worth whatever she's going to ask for. I got these two wolf puppies.
Cyrus Schwert 01:02:21 Let's give her a tip.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:27 I think tonight's the night he could be convinced to let him go. Super, super, super powerful.
Dungeon Master 01:02:37 How dare you.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:44 I like the idea that we all make a pact that we're not going to get anything. And then one of us comes out with like machine gun and their chest. Yeah. Just like what happened? Yeah. I give all your guys's souls are forfeit, but I got this sweet gun.
Cyrus Schwert 01:02:55 I gave up all your guys' stuff. Look what I got. Second Amendment, baby. Yeah, I didn't see the name. Game on.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:58 Don't worry. Don't worry. It's worth it. Talked about the ritual. Yeah, the fountain of truth. Discord chat? Virtual thing like that?
Leopold Magnus 01:03:04 Nice. Where did you put that quote, Jonathan? You said you put it in the chat. The initial one that I think was said about the fountain. Yeah, the ritual. On the map, how do I get there?
Dungeon Master 01:03:09 Which one? It's in the virtual tabletop. No, on the map. If you scroll up enough, I just post it as a message.
Dungeon Master 01:03:43 you know, where it says your intelligence checks and everything, and it says when you connect to the server, you can just type stuff in there too. So I just typed it out. Do you see it? Hold on. Yeah, it might have just sent to me. I can just...
Leopold Magnus 01:03:55 I might be missing it. Yeah, I'm on VTT.
Kaladen Shash 01:03:56 Are you on the VTT seeing that? Yeah, there's now it's in the game log thing.
Cyrus Schwert 01:03:56 I do. Yeah. Well, it's strange because I can see.
Dungeon Master 01:04:12 Everyone.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:18 Here we go.
Kaladen Shash 01:04:36 Yeah, reading that, I think our best bet is maybe just still asking about how this forest has gotten to be how it is and what she might know about rituals at the tree. I mean, the
Leopold Magnus 01:04:54 Yeah, I think that makes
Cyrus Schwert 01:04:54 Or we can ask what kind of thing we have to give up or sacrifice. So we have a base for that, for the ritual. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:05:08 I mean, the ritual itself makes it pretty clear, like you're sort of giving up who you were, like death and then rebirth. Jonathan, can I, after doing my meditation, can I work a few hours on an enchantment?
Dungeon Master 01:05:31 You starting a new one? Yeah. Yeah? Um, probably. You tell me.
Kaladen Shash 01:05:44 Yeah. I just want to do a boots of Elven kind. Isn't that an, isn't that a common item? I need to figure it out. Let's see. It's uncommon, Jonathan.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:00 Yeah, I was going to say, can I work a bit on the, have I upgraded Bone Crusher's armor yet? I'm pretty close, I thought.
Dungeon Master 01:06:08 I think it was just the cough that you had been waiting on before. Yeah, I mean, we'll just consult the enchanting guide. Um... Base item, enchantment time...
Kaladen Shash 01:06:14 Jonathan, they're uncommon. Is that something I could still work on? Cool, cool.
Dungeon Master 01:06:35 It's based off a spell level in this. So Boots of Elvenkind would be like Cast Without a Trace, and that's a second level spell. Jesse, do you know? Do you have it? It is... Yeah, I'm checking in right now.
Kaladen Shash 01:06:48 Okay. I don't know. I don't know what cast blood traces. I never cast it. I think Cletus is the other one that has one.
Dungeon Master 01:07:06 it is a second level spell. So that would be 32 hours, DC 14, four checks. So it's kind of been in the realm that you were already in. Yeah, you start laying the basic enchantment.
Cyrus Schwert 01:07:08 awesome
Kaladen Shash 01:07:21 Okay, cool. Yeah, I want to go ahead and just plug, I guess, maybe like four hours or six hours if I can. It depends on how quick we get out of there in the morning. I'll give you kind of
Dungeon Master 01:07:36 and little runes that you have to like, first you have to get the leaves. You have Leopold kind of whip those up. You fold them into the right shape and you like stitch in, in like a rune pattern along it so that you can lay enchantments into the runes later, get the foundation going. Um, we'll say for the first six hours, um, you don't have to make a check. And then like, once you hit eight hours, you'll make your first check.
Cyrus Schwert 01:07:41 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:08:02 Cool. Oh, no, I didn't do temporary.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:04 Did everybody add their 2d10 Heroes Feast points? I rolled for me, but it doesn't say, but I would roll individually because I rolled a five.
Dungeon Master 01:08:10 You guys are heroes feasting. Next time, it'll be one roll for everybody, but I'll let it slide.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:12 So 2D10, did you already roll that or do we need to roll it? Nice 10, so I just get a 10.
Cyrus Schwert 01:08:17 Yeah, is it individual for each of us?
Kaladen Shash 01:08:35 That's what I thought. I'm going to take it. I didn't get much. I got a seven. These are all soft. These are all soft. Cable. I think we got money in the bank for that.
Dungeon Master 01:08:38 uh did you guys have a chalice right is that what it takes a chalice worth a thousand gold
Zariel Torgan 01:08:47 Yeah, I might have just had money worth that. Is that acceptable? Could I just mark off a thousand worth of stuff?
Cyrus Schwert 01:08:48 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:09:09 yes but i'll also say next time you'll need to be like i buy you know this many thousands of gold worth of chalices for this spell anytime a spell gives like a very specific item worth value it's it's got to be used
Kaladen Shash 01:09:17 A chalice Roger that Yeah
Zariel Torgan 01:09:27 Gotcha. That's fair. Okay, next time we're in civilization, I'll pick up some stuff. I got a few things I need to buy. I know I already have some diamond stuff for getting people back, but next time I'll get some chalice stuff.
Dungeon Master 01:09:52 Perfect. Okay. Guy's got your long rest. You've got your temporary hit points. You've got... Oh, geez. That gives you advantage on everything, doesn't it? Like most wisdom-based checks and can't be afraid and there's something else in there. Can't be poisoned. Pretty good spell.
Cyrus Schwert 01:09:54 Thanks.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:06 Just wisdom. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:17 So John, then you said it was just money that I needed for the final upgrades on Bone Crusher?
Dungeon Master 01:10:22 yeah you had done all your checks but that was before you guys had hit sort of that cash stock so you have you were just sort of like waiting to put the monetary like mechanically it doesn't make sense right like you'd be investing the money through the whole process to do it but in a game it's just fine to be like you put in the work and then you put the money up when you have it so bone crushers upgrades you're waiting on that
Dungeon Master 01:10:48 financial investment. Otherwise, as soon as you do that, you'll be able to finish it. Yeah. I think Zariel's keeping all of it. Not selfishly, but he keeps track of it.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:49 Okay. Didn't we come into some money? Didn't we find a little bunch of cash?
Cyrus Schwert 01:10:55 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:01 Yeah, I've got, just so everybody knows, as of right now, we've got, let's see, 2,300 worth of just like coins, so platinum and gold. And then we have another 650 worth of diamonds, rubies, and gems.
Kaladen Shash 01:11:03 Yeah, he's there, just the bank. We're going to see how we used a little bit to get. That farmer filling.
Dungeon Master 01:11:29 It costs 2,000 for a first level enchantment. First and second share the same enchantment. Oh, and we said it was cantrip. So that would be, there's a cost to it, 500.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:40 I think I was just trying to upgrade his armor class. OK, so. 500 gold. What would the AC be up by just one or?
Kaladen Shash 01:11:44 That's what we use from that.
Dungeon Master 01:12:04 He was basically gaining the benefits of, like, the black dragon hide, right? Similar to you? Yeah, so he gets, like, a poison resistance, and he is plate armor, so there's no, like, armor that's better. So he's just got the magical bonus of armor, um...
Leopold Magnus 01:12:11 Yeah, yeah, I was tying in that drain, yeah. Alright, so AC up by one and resistance to poison damage.
Dungeon Master 01:12:27 I'll say, like, you can give him a shield, so bump it by, like, one, and he's got resistance to poison damage. Yeah. Nice.
Leopold Magnus 01:12:40 Cool, okay. Are you guys cool with me spending 500 gold? Cool, yeah, so I think that would bring his AC to 16.
Kaladen Shash 01:12:46 Turn that.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:47 Yeah, yeah, I'll mark it off. Thanks. There we go. Alright, so we've got less than 2000. On the coins and still about 650 on the gems.
Dungeon Master 01:13:13 Nice. Yeah. You could spend your morning doing something else you'd like. Ooh, nice. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:13:22 I guess if that was the case, what have I had time to work on something where just just needed the money and it was works already done. Yeah, I'll work on some of the blueprints I drafted for chips, shotgun. Or or weapon. Yeah, I think I kind of sketched a few things.
Dungeon Master 01:13:43 And you all need about the same rest so you can get like six hours similar to Caledon. You guys are just working away in the little shop. Get that done. Put in that time. No issue there. Anything else from the group? That's most of you. Okay. As you guys
Cyrus Schwert 01:14:06 Not for me.
Dungeon Master 01:14:14 wrap up your morning in front of this cabin you just kind of stare at it occasionally there's a partially broken and crooked wooden door that kind of hangs poorly at the entrance frame but it still somehow blocks your view of the inside door sits shut there's moss growing up on the edges of everything
Dungeon Master 01:14:38 The lantern, the cabin has been still enough for long enough. The lantern no longer swings. So there's just a constant bathing of light that you can kind of catch even in the daylight. You see smoke rising from the chimney stack up top. When you aren't focusing on it entirely, you can almost swear that the house is like breathing, like everything has energy and almost movement to it. But you guys have this in front of you.
Dungeon Master 01:15:08 You've got the roots behind you. What would you like to do?
Cyrus Schwert 01:15:22 Who wants to knock? But you want me to knock? Okay. Wasn't planning on it. I feel like I need to ask consent first. This thing's like alive.
Kaladen Shash 01:15:24 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:26 No, you first, Cyrus. I insist. Well, you're not going to barge right in, are you?
Zariel Torgan 01:15:31 Yeah, you should go first.
Cyrus Schwert 01:15:54 Um, I guess I walk up and then I scuttle away back to the group unless we're all together.
Kaladen Shash 01:15:56 Like, we don't detect any sort of, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:16:01 walk up uh cyrus is the leader of the group okay as soon as you as soon as you go to knock it's like as your knuckles touch the wood the door gives and freaks up and just like gentle dark lit interior um but you back off the porch onto the snow and ash uh sort of like watch it for a second and nothing happens you get a a faint whiff of
Dungeon Master 01:16:31 really warm herbs and spices. You get like cinnamon and clove and peppers and you just get like this rich scent wash over you from somewhere in the inside.
Kaladen Shash 01:16:50 Do we, like, whenever Zariel flew past it, he got, like, some really intense vibes? Are we getting, like, any sort of sensation being this close to the house with the door open?
Dungeon Master 01:17:03 No, it was more of Zariel came in fast to get as close to get a better look in a magical form. Like this foreign magical essence attempted to invade the space while it was moving and probably less defensive. And he was shunted away as a defense. And Cyrus, when you even run briefly, you see scrawled, like scribbled even,
Dungeon Master 01:17:29 all over the wood, etched deep into everything are just these incomprehensible runes of a long dead language that it doesn't look like Draconic. It doesn't look like any sort of common magical runes which are based in Draconic. It doesn't seem like arcane or nature. It is just this incomprehensible stuff scrawled all over the cabin. And it's like, you're like, oh yeah, this place is fortified within Janus.
Dungeon Master 01:18:00 But if you don't have hostile intentions, you don't feel like anything more than just off-put. No response.
Cyrus Schwert 01:18:01 Hello. Excuse me. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:18:13 Yes, let us. Hello? Oh, let us get closer. Go ahead. I'm right behind you. Go ahead. Walk forward.
Cyrus Schwert 01:18:33 I like stick my hand across the threshold of the door, just waiting for something to hit me.
Dungeon Master 01:18:39 creak the door open more and more um that suspense never drops because nothing ever happens the door finishes swinging open and it's almost like entering the space puts you in a different space it is much larger on the inside um not like mansion to cabin size but it is a larger space on the inside than the outside uh dark dimly lit um
Dungeon Master 01:19:10 There is a thick carpets and furs and faded tapestries drape over the walls and are scattered on the floor underneath and behind. So the floor and the walls, you see similar sort of incomprehensible scrawlings.
Cyrus Schwert 01:19:22 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:19:32 of like runes written out in blood just faded into the wall in the wood um just covered up depicting gruesome scenes and mysterious depictions things you don't totally understand in the center of the room there is a crooked iron cauldron sitting on a central hearth
Cyrus Schwert 01:19:53 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:19:55 glowing at the base with an unnaturally hot heat you see sparks kind of belt out from the bottom of it and there is um that scent much stronger in here you get whiffs of flowers cinnamon burning hair blood and iron
Dungeon Master 01:20:16 herbs, spices, just constant bombardment of different but very strong and discernible scents. You see there are like little things hanging from the rafters and the beams for like grabbing, like little herb bundles and like mint patches. And you see what looks like a dehydrated, preserved, like mummified imp body strung up to like a mummified plant
Dungeon Master 01:20:44 fairy form just like hanging like as if it's been used for ingredients and stuff there's a low ceiling the constant firelight of the hearth makes everything sort of bounce back and forth you have old shelves that sag under the weight of glass jars that have
Dungeon Master 01:21:03 feet in them and pickled heads and swirling clouds of potions that you don't know what they do but like black ichor and vibrant purples and it is a lived in warm space of like eldritch horror there is a wheel
Kaladen Shash 01:21:05 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:21:23 put in like the base of the, sorry, the corner of one of the rooms that spins a golden thread out of nowhere. It manifests out of the air and it is like being braided and rolled up into twine. There are offshoots in rooms covered by just like draping and like cloth separation. So there's not like doors on everything.
Cyrus Schwert 01:21:42 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:21:45 They kind of lead off to different places in here. But as you guys take all of this in as you're walking in and the first step, the floorboard creaks and it almost sounds like it's sobbing underneath your weight.
Dungeon Master 01:21:59 Very unsettling. And there is this large figure sort of silently moving around in a different room, hunched over, large sort of robe and cloak thrown over their back. You see sprouts of like strange thinning gray hair kind of popping up on the top of their head as they're like facing away from you, digging in some stuff.
Dungeon Master 01:22:24 What is the order? I know Cyrus is leading, obviously, but what is everybody else looking like as they come in behind? Cyrus, Kaladin, Zario, Leopold, Cletus.
Cyrus Schwert 01:22:34 Cyrus throws up in his mouth a little bit when he sees the feet in the jars, by the way. Just to put that out there. Right when he sees them, it's... Oh, my God. This place is fucking nasty.
Kaladen Shash 01:22:34 Yeah, I'm just right behind him.
Leopold Magnus 01:22:36 Yep. I'm going last
Zariel Torgan 01:22:39 I'll go behind Kaladin.
Dungeon Master 01:22:54 you guys sort of walk in the waft of the smoke and the damp wood of the mosque kind of hits you next and still it's not you got the evil presence before Zariel but you don't feel that now this is like
Dungeon Master 01:23:14 uh a grandma's house vibe it is collections of things that are needed for other things that maybe don't make sense to you but they make sense to somebody and there's so many rugs and throw blankets and furs and stuff that you could basically lay down anywhere and be comfortable um and then
Dungeon Master 01:23:37 Along with that, though, there is this sense where you know instantly that this is the realm of the Baba Yaga. This is her space. This place is flowing with more magic in Ra Arcana of a world you have never experienced and you have ever felt before. This is like...
Dungeon Master 01:23:59 This is the kind of room where wishes come true kind of magic, right? You get that instant. You know that instantly when you were in here. And this form turns to you and even curled with a severe hunch, they are over eight feet tall.
Dungeon Master 01:24:20 this very tall lumbering figure, long, elongated, thin spindly arms, fingers that are so long they kind of curl down a little bit, pale skin that is stained black around the mouth as like the ichor and saliva that comes out is not clear. There is scars, long faded, but you can catch them in the light of
Dungeon Master 01:24:46 ancient like again runes and scrawlings all over their skin anywhere there's exposed flesh you've got little etchings of scars long faded um dirt under the fingernails black brown red um the stringy hair gives a little bit more of an innocent view of like a severe bedhead it's not presentable it's very forgotten about um
Cyrus Schwert 01:24:50 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:25:14 One eye is slightly bigger than the other, and it kind of droops a little bit, but they both hang low, set into a face of deep, deep wrinkles. Wrinkles that almost look like brain folds. They're just like skin kind of goes in on itself. Oh, I dressed that up. And then you see it...
Cyrus Schwert 01:25:36 Or.
Dungeon Master 01:25:41 Even in like the shifting light, it doesn't make sense at first, but when they talk, it will make sense. As a grandma, there is like the chin hair and the mustache hair, but looking at them, you can kind of swear that when the light shifts, the form goes from inherently feminine features to inherently masculine features shared in an old form. But this figure is like constantly shifting.
Cyrus Schwert 01:26:06 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:26:11 in and out of existence like as you know it they are not male nor female it is not human or inhuman it's not mortal or immortal this is like this is just like honestly the most powerful but most unalarming figure you've ever seen hands down
Dungeon Master 01:26:30 They just exude that being in the presence. And unless you guys say something right away, I'll continue with my little monologue. Do you guys want to do anything? He hasn't said anything. You did say hello before.
Kaladen Shash 01:26:46 No, I shouldn't say anything yet, right? We're just seeing her now.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:49 Yeah, just soaking it all in. What? What?
Cyrus Schwert 01:26:50 We yelled from outside. What the fuck did you just say?
Leopold Magnus 01:26:54 I'll just whisper to Zariel, and I'll say, oh, dear, I'm getting that feeling that I had earlier when you were going to beat me off. Well, you know.
Dungeon Master 01:27:09 You hear, without moving her lips, a voice that is in, like, two different octaves, both masculine and feminine, in, like, a cackling laugh. Like, that was the most unhinged thing they've ever heard also. Pure enjoyment. And she, like, then her mouth catches up. She opens her mouth and noise does come out, but it almost precedes it any time she talks.
Kaladen Shash 01:27:28 No.
Dungeon Master 01:27:36 She wipes a tear from her face and like a really scratchy voice just coming out of her mouth. She goes, it is. Happened that we meet on this day, don't you think? And she like is turned and she's got like a mortar and pestle and she's mixing some stuff. She goes, what are the chances I find you on a stroll? And you just have a knowing look into her eye as she does like gesture you forward.
Dungeon Master 01:28:07 Come, sit, let's talk. What secrets there are to uncover? Looking right at you, Cyrus. Licks her lip in kind of a creepy, like, insane way, not in a seductive way. Like, her lips got so dry so fast that she had to aggressively lick them. She, like, was waiting. Yeah, absolutely.
Kaladen Shash 01:28:13 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:28:16 Oh. Can I do an insight check? And if I fail, I think it's sexual. Sounds good. We're looking for middle of the pack. I mean...
Zariel Torgan 01:28:31 Oh no.
Dungeon Master 01:28:33 If you fail too hard or succeed too hard, it'll be sexual. I mean, that's a failure in my book. She looks down, she goes...
Cyrus Schwert 01:28:50 Okay, okay. It struts up. What you got in that pestle? I mean mortar. Really? You get pine nuts all the way out here, huh? That's awesome. I lean against something super gross. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:28:57 Uh huh.
Dungeon Master 01:29:02 It's pesto, believe it or not. It sticks to you. You can tell that whatever you put your hand on is going to lift up with you when you lift your elbow. And she goes, come, see. Please discuss. Cyrus. I was lying earlier, believe it or not. It's not pesto.
Cyrus Schwert 01:29:20 I was gonna ask.
Dungeon Master 01:29:32 happened chance that you came here i've been expecting you and she sits down the mortar and she sits and her legs like the knees are kind of like at her shoulder line like she's sitting way under her haunches robe draped over everything you're not seeing anything gross but like she's uncomfortably large in this space and she um puts down the mortar and pestle she's sitting across from you on the fire there is some like
Dungeon Master 01:29:57 throw rug seats on one end and she sits on the other and she sat down and she she pulls out a long pipe and lights it at the end and she starts taking deep pulls on it and she goes you know who i am yes this is no mystery to you
Kaladen Shash 01:30:04 you
Cyrus Schwert 01:30:20 You're the Baba Yaga. I'm pretty sure.
Dungeon Master 01:30:23 And in a deep voice, you hear, yes. Back to the granny voice. I am. I am. The one and only, if you will. Takes a long pull. I can tell you what you don't know you want to know, child. Or I can tell you what you want to know. It's up to you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:30:53 I don't know. I'll take something I don't know I want.
Dungeon Master 01:31:00 Interesting. She looks to the rest of you consenting. She goes, But the child wants what he doesn't know he wants. Interesting indeed. Can I propose to you a question in itself? Cyrus, my dear. Do you think it's chance that you, so powerful and unique, found this group of friends so powerful and unique?
Dungeon Master 01:31:29 Each of you capable of surpassing the people around you so fast. So unique. Answer me that and I'll answer your question. Takes an excited hole on her pipe. Yeah, I...
Cyrus Schwert 01:31:44 Um, you ever heard of the butterfly effect? It's like that. Sure. Sure.
Kaladen Shash 01:31:46 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:31:53 I rip off Kaladin's legs over here and the child in Redivir is born without a heart. That one, yes. We are familiar with the same concepts.
Cyrus Schwert 01:32:08 I mean, the group here, the O'Dears, stole some pups, and then we had to flee where we were living, and then on the way out, some guy named Ratshit told us to find these guys. So, I mean, I don't think it's happened chance either, Mr. Bobby Young.
Kaladen Shash 01:32:25 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:32:27 I'm not so convinced myself. I really think it's fate. But on to your question. It is not chance, Cyrus, my boy. You ever wonder if you're powerful enough to rule a realm? Do you think you have potential to embark on a journey?
Cyrus Schwert 01:32:58 To rule a realm? I mean, not really. Not by myself, at least.
Dungeon Master 01:33:00 Not by yourself. Great answer. You see, she reaches up and out of nowhere, she pulls a gold thread, like just out of unreality. She pulls it and almost like she's reading it. She looks over and she goes, in my younger days,
Kaladen Shash 01:33:00 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:33:30 It's a spirit of the forest even before I grew a house. There's a story of a young boy and his friends. A beast of the lands. Fae lords of their own. What was his name? I forget it. He was so talented and musical and
Dungeon Master 01:33:57 Oh, man, he could do some damage with a sword. I'll tell you that for sure. Oh, is it you? Do you think that you are this boy? It can't be. I can make you the boy. Cyrus, and she leans over this cauldron. She goes, I have a proposition.
Cyrus Schwert 01:34:06 Me. Is it me? I could be the boy. I could be the boy if you want me to be. Okay. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:34:30 She goes, points, Leopold didn't bring enough of the wellspring for all of you. She, with her other hand, pulls out of nowhere a vial containing a very familiar-looking fluid. She goes, Kaladin is not the only special child in this party. You should...
Dungeon Master 01:34:57 Not exclude yourself from this, I think. I'm willing to part with this for a price. And she sort of squeezes it up. You see the glass starts to break on all the sides. And she goes, what does something like this cost, I wonder? An arm, a leg, your soul.
Kaladen Shash 01:35:22 That price escalated very quick. Or just yourself, you know, like casual stuff. I have wooden arm. It's working out very well.
Cyrus Schwert 01:35:23 That feels deep to me. I mean, we, we, we just like went and got it. You're proposing. I lose an arm. That's true.
Dungeon Master 01:35:28 What does it sell? I sold mine to a devil. It's worthless. She goes, California.
Dungeon Master 01:35:53 I never thought you'd mention it. I have some information for you as well. And I'll be very upfront. In order to get your information, I will be taking your arm. Good question. Maybe. I will see you like your other one.
Cyrus Schwert 01:36:05 So would one of the real ones.
Kaladen Shash 01:36:05 okay my soul my soul with arm don't know if i like that i don't don't understand what you need arm for i leave no information yet
Dungeon Master 01:36:21 She leans back off of her haunches a bit, relaxed, and she goes, I can tell there is a lot to choose from, so let's narrow this down. I'll let you know for one price something about each of you that you don't know. Cyrus, you're technically on the house at this point. I can tell you something about the Cursed King.
Cyrus Schwert 01:36:46 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 01:36:53 I could tell you something about your precious home, Nunu Arbor. And how maybe they're not so separate of problems, the king and your town. Or... Who knows? I'll make your wildest dreams come true. But, one price for each of the things. I want to take something from each of you. I'm feeling generous.
Kaladen Shash 01:37:28 What will this price be? Oh, God, all the feet. I got yours.
Dungeon Master 01:37:33 She goes, who wants to give up something? I'll tell you what I want. I've been watching each of you before you were conceived or even a conception, really. I know what you have and what I want. I'm always looking to add to my collection. But there's not much fun in just demanding, right? I want something from you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:38:00 I take out my cum pillow Ziploc and I offer it up. You can fix your hair with this. You can sleep on it. Who knows? You know why. You have fun, huh? Can I have it back?
Dungeon Master 01:38:03 she goes what is this a sugar cube or something she picks it up and she's like why is it kind of sticky i haven't seen this before and she like is like playing with it a little bit and she goes i know why i tell you what this is pretty good um no i can make this on my own job
Kaladen Shash 01:38:04 Ha ha ha ha.
Dungeon Master 01:38:29 And that sound comes out a little bit deeper voice is when that one comes out. Oh, yes. Takes it from behind the back. I wasn't going to take it. I was just forgetting about it. Forgetting my old age. That's hearsay.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:35 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:38:39 Can I have the pillow back? I mean, if you're not going to take it, if you can make one, like I'll just take that one. You were putting it in your pocket. Okay. So more like arm and less like cum pillow. Understood.
Dungeon Master 01:39:00 I think, uh, information of weight. Yes. Can I get you guys some tea in the meantime? Don't worry if you don't want I, and she sort of her fingers snap. And when they cross, they're so long, they pass each other so fast. Um, and she goes, I've, uh,
Kaladen Shash 01:39:09 Very good.
Dungeon Master 01:39:26 I've bought this some time. You don't have to worry about what's going on up there. We're in this moment, we'll say. And she hits back. She starts mixing some teas, some different herbs and stuff, humming to herself, waiting for you guys to sort of regroup if you want. Otherwise, she'll probably back down in a second or two.
Cyrus Schwert 01:39:36 This magic moment. That's what I was thinking.
Leopold Magnus 01:39:40 Oh, Cyrus, I think she might be into you.
Kaladen Shash 01:39:55 I don't think anybody's got a body part they're ready to split with. That's what I'm understanding.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:02 So do we get the impression that one of us is going to give up something in order for everybody to get what they want? Is that the premise? He's not here.
Dungeon Master 01:40:12 Yeah. But... You know that's what he was asked to. You don't know. Maybe if you counter or you swindle, you guys were advised against it, but it's not...
Cyrus Schwert 01:40:17 I feel like Cletus doesn't need both arms.
Leopold Magnus 01:40:19 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:40:32 certain shows online have proved that you can light up a hag and get away with it. Um, like if you guys surprised me, I wouldn't deny it, but you do know that if one of you guys at random was just like, yep, I'll, I'll give you something. She's going to take something from that person. That's probably a wanted piece of them in some way. Um,
Dungeon Master 01:40:56 You don't know how it'll be necessarily. But and then, yeah, everybody would benefit or everybody would learn the knowledge. If you picked about, you know, new new Arbor or the Chris King, if you ask a different question that I didn't hear when I stepped away, you know, you guys can ask specifically about certain stuff. Just a probe.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:22 I'll give up something to get what I want. Well, seeing that nobody else is too keen on moving up, I'll step up a little bit. I might have something. Perhaps.
Dungeon Master 01:41:28 Do you step up? She looks at you knowingly and she goes, ah, it's sorry. Is it Ariel or was it Zero? I can never remember these days.
Dungeon Master 01:41:58 How can I help you, child?
Zariel Torgan 01:42:02 Yeah. I just figured I'd see if I could give something for the group. I'd like to help out.
Dungeon Master 01:42:18 She holds up a hand first. She goes, an offer. Let's set the rules. And a table is in front of you instead of the cauldron. And a book opens. And as it's opening, you can tell it's bound in like an old, ancient skin. The pages flop over one by one, each of them bone white. And on an empty page on both sides, she goes, the ground rules.
Dungeon Master 01:42:49 Verbal agreement. I tell you what I want, you tell me what you want. Some bartering, maybe. But then a handshake deal. What do you say? All right. What would you like to know, Zahariel Thorgan?
Zariel Torgan 01:43:05 Sounds just fine to me. Am I answering for the group here or am I answering just for me?
Dungeon Master 01:43:23 I don't know. Are you answering for the group or for you?
Leopold Magnus 01:43:23 Dude, you're the one making the deal.
Kaladen Shash 01:43:25 I was going to say, I think you get to ask your own question or what you didn't know you needed to know. Right. Everybody gets it.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:31 I thought that it was one person gives up something and then everybody gets to know what they want to know. I just wanted to give something up to make it easier on everybody. So I don't want to ask all the questions. If everybody else has stuff they want to ask...
Cyrus Schwert 01:43:38 Are we more interested in information about ourselves or about like the world situation? Is the options that she gave
Kaladen Shash 01:44:01 Well, she gave us two options, ask a, essentially, right, she gave kind of a question, ask a question, or she would let us know something that, or no, what do we want, or what do we not, didn't know we needed.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:15 Yeah. Something we wanted to know or something we didn't know we needed.
Cyrus Schwert 01:44:15 Mm hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:44:17 That's just what she sort of proposed. But you get the sense that if there's something else that you guys think of, or maybe that I didn't think of in prep, you feel free to come with, one, multiple questions. You don't know that everything is going to come with a cost. Or, like I said, if you guys planned something when I walked away, I didn't hear it this time. I didn't have my earpiece in. But if there's something else you guys want to talk about.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:49 I don't think I'm going to ask questions for the group, but I will. I'll still talk to her. Yeah, we could, I guess. Is there something you guys want me to ask?
Cyrus Schwert 01:44:59 Well, we could decide as a group, and you could just... Unless he just wants to kind of...
Leopold Magnus 01:45:13 I don't have a burning question, but I did have a few small ones. We're done with that big one.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:19 Did I get the impression, Jonathan, that if I was to give up something, that everybody else would get a chance to ask a question? Or do I get the impression this is just a one-on-one thing? Alright, well... Well...
Dungeon Master 01:45:30 It could go both ways. You could get something for everybody if it's large enough sacrifice.
Cyrus Schwert 01:45:31 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:42 I don't really need too much info. I'm not the thinking one of the group. However, I would like a couple of my friends to be able to ask a couple of questions from you. What would you want for something like that? Medium sized.
Dungeon Master 01:46:03 Couple of small questions. Medium question. What do I want from you? How about this? I'll tell you what you want to know. And then I'll take from you
Kaladen Shash 01:46:08 Medium. Medium. Medium question.
Dungeon Master 01:46:33 Some memories. Memories that I choose. Nothing of consequence, really. I would never. She goes, let me explain. And she gestures around. She goes, all of these have purposes.
Zariel Torgan 01:46:43 I've seen this before. You're going to take my memory of how to breathe or something stupid and I'm going to...
Cyrus Schwert 01:46:45 Thank you. Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:46:50 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:46:50 It's not in my shoe.
Dungeon Master 01:47:03 reason for being here what i don't have what has never existed is artificial life breathing with the soul of a man i want your ability to connect with life how is it
Dungeon Master 01:47:28 That an automaton. She like lifts up your arm and drops it. She goes. As the form. Of a bear. Or an elemental. Of the planes. Shouldn't exist. This interests me. I want to know how you did it. So I will scour your memory. I will find the reason. That you can. I won't remove your ability to do it. But I will.
Dungeon Master 01:47:57 remove your knowledge of how in your position or not. Unless you have a counter. She rasped her fingers on the table expectantly. Her eyes narrow a little bit, puffs a little bit harder in her pipe.
Cyrus Schwert 01:47:59 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:15 Ariel's gonna also wrap his fingers, trying to, like, mimic... Yeah! Uh... That's a good... Ariel?
Dungeon Master 01:48:27 crude businessman right there and she like out of nowhere kind of adjusts a little like accounting cap that she just like has on her head her hair spilling out over top of it and she goes let's match energies no
Cyrus Schwert 01:48:37 Sure.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:46 I see your offer. It would seem as if you want to know how this mech-o-man can do stuff. Why don't you swap me into a different dude and then you can just have the metal body and you can do what you want with it and then I'll
Dungeon Master 01:49:15 her eyes both of them larger and smaller widen greatly she goes the form itself smiles and you see her black teeth like saliva of black just kind of like in between and stringing off but she smiles big and she goes oh that's worth quite a bit of information agree no she looks up to the rest of you
Zariel Torgan 01:49:24 I want my soul though. That's where all my charm is.
Dungeon Master 01:49:45 Fair deal on both ends. Ah, where's the fun in that? I already have ideas of what to do with you. Here's the deal. I tell you a lot about yourselves. I throw in some information about our old first king. I transition Zariel in his soul, entirety, memories, abilities.
Kaladen Shash 01:49:46 what kind of body will Zariel get if he gives up his machine? What is he transferred to?
Leopold Magnus 01:49:50 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:50:14 limited to his form, of course, to a new body. Randomly. Do not disclose how I do this. Deal or no deal. Reach.
Leopold Magnus 01:50:22 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:50:27 Well, I think we should get one more cool thing from you if you're going to get my body. I mean, look at me. I'm going to do a spin. Look at this.
Kaladen Shash 01:50:37 The whole thing. I mean, the form is pretty cool. Look at this thing. Ha ha ha.
Cyrus Schwert 01:50:45 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:50:48 I have existed in planes that you can't comprehend. The form is not what is unique. It is what you've done with the form that is unique. I want your essence on this form. The body of metal I can make in the next room over fine. That's not of interest. It is your body of metal. What do you want extra?
Zariel Torgan 01:51:21 Yeah, I knew all that. What do you guys think? What do you guys want? Well, uh...
Dungeon Master 01:51:24 What do you want that from?
Leopold Magnus 01:51:26 Oh, oh, sorry. Are you sure about all this? You're giving up quite a bit.
Kaladen Shash 01:51:27 What do you want, man? We're already getting some questions answered. You should ask for some sort of sweet-ass buff or permanent enhancement. You're giving something up. You don't know what body you're getting.
Cyrus Schwert 01:51:30 The deal is fine.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:50 Maybe we could get something that would help the group. Like a cup that has soda in it. Or maybe some sort of dairy-based drink. Or something more practical or cool. Maybe we could get a little friend.
Kaladen Shash 01:52:01 Oh, no. Just a beverage cup.
Cyrus Schwert 01:52:04 What about a
Zariel Torgan 01:52:17 that hangs out with us and keeps me safe. Why don't you surprise me, Mr. Baba Yaga?
Dungeon Master 01:52:20 All right.
Leopold Magnus 01:52:25 Could this berry buff be like a go juice? Take a sip and you get like a small buff.
Cyrus Schwert 01:52:33 an almond milk chalice that's worth around a thousand gold or so, let's say. It's Mr. It's both.
Kaladen Shash 01:52:45 Baby, hang a big...
Zariel Torgan 01:52:49 Mr. You. Give me an idea. Well, I did lay out some basic parameters of what I wanted. I mean, how do I know you can provide? Well, you haven't promised anything yet.
Dungeon Master 01:52:54 Your Baba Yaga will be plenty generous. You want me to propose something extra on a deal I thought was fair, correct? Hmm. Not really useful. Oh, I wouldn't promise what I can't uphold. I...
Cyrus Schwert 01:53:05 It sounds silly when you say it.
Dungeon Master 01:53:19 I've skinned and made rugs of beings who made deals they couldn't uphold. Wouldn't do that to you. Do you want the skin rug? I can show you my collection. I think I have a deal. I will give you one of my prized skin cloaks. Each of them has its own unique ability.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:26 I have one of them. Yeah, I mean, you could throw it in. All right. Yeah. Let me see him. What?
Kaladen Shash 01:53:46 Let's go. This is good. This is a good deal. It's all, it's a flower. You know, this is not talking out loud. I'm just so nervous.
Dungeon Master 01:53:48 I'll let you pick from my collection. No. Deal or no deal?
Zariel Torgan 01:53:56 Don't say that. We're still negotiating. Alright. She has all the leverage. Alright. Well, I'll tell you what. I hope I'm not a gnome. But, you know what? Even if I am a gnome, I'll be happy. So...
Cyrus Schwert 01:53:57 Zeriel, she's got some of the power here, for sure. I've never done this before, I'm sorry. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:54:24 I'll do you an extra favor. And you see, as she like goes and clasp your hand for the deal, she gets in close. She goes, I'll let you have some say in what you come back as. And with her other hand, she reaches back and she embeds it through your chest, lifting your form off the ground, hand out of the back, holding your artificial core and heart and your body like seizes and goes limp. And she throws it down to the ground.
Dungeon Master 01:54:55 breaks the core and sprinkles it into the cauldron that's back in front of her and she goes we'll come back to that we'll fill him in on the back end no uh but each of you um what's what i was working with a customer um we'll get to each other right um
Kaladen Shash 01:55:03 Holy shit lady. What the fuck was that? So we have the opportunity. You said you were going to let everybody know something about themselves. Is that what we bargained?
Zariel Torgan 01:55:06 Come back to it.
Cyrus Schwert 01:55:06 That was fucking crazy.
Dungeon Master 01:55:20 In front, she goes, who's first? Who wants to know something? I'll fill Zuri in a little later. Yeah. You're included. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:55:34 I will go ahead and talk to you. Yeah, everybody. No, you are.
Cyrus Schwert 01:55:41 Am I still included in that? Or did I not like already?
Dungeon Master 01:55:50 And she goes, we'll start talking about him because he's not here to discuss this. Zariel was created by a man who happens to be of importance to this tale.
Dungeon Master 01:56:06 So I'll back it up just a little bit for each and every one of you. And she goes, Zario, actually, I changed my mind. You are included. And she like snaps her fingers. And you see like Zario's ghost is just sitting there next to you. Kind of goes off to a classic ghost tale where it's like a little phantom to a point and not just like his legs. And she goes, I need you to hear to listen to this. She goes, so many years ago, I was just walking and tending my garden.
Kaladen Shash 01:56:18 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:56:35 A mage approached me. He offered deal for more power. I want this. You do this for me. He reeked of arrogance. A man you know as the Cursed King. Kaladin, a man you know to be a relative. Zariel, that is the man that created you. His name was Tentherian.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:01 step.
Dungeon Master 01:57:04 A mage mad with power. First council whatever title he held. Ridiculous. He just wanted more. He wanted my more. I turned him down. He was spiteful. He came back with a hard deal. For as smart and learned as he was, there was a big gap in that deal. He might take credit for it, but reality is...
Dungeon Master 01:57:34 The curse of Aesopthra was mine. He's mine. I enjoy it daily. It's so great to see power flow through nature once again. Tentherion went mad trying to figure out how to counter a bad deal that destroyed the land. Wasn't going to allow it. He had to be the most impacted.
Dungeon Master 01:58:02 There was some foresight in what he did, though. He knew my ways. He knew I tricked him. He is a failsafe. He built a robot capable of harnessing energy. And he built a robot capable of harnessing it for the pure purpose of harnessing fey magic. Zariel is an artificial fey.
Dungeon Master 01:58:28 He can take form of presence and grandeur in the realm just with his aura, not his body. The fact that Tentherian successfully blended a human soul into a robot beyond knowledge of this realm, something he must have really, really wanted, really wished for. Galadin, you are obviously a Feyblood.
Dungeon Master 01:58:57 We'll get to that in a moment. Think of Zariel as who he made him to be was you, right? Zariel is what you are. He is, if you were never born, he could still move forward with this prophecy with a substitute. At the wellspring, his form magically sucked up the water? I don't think so. That was intentional. It was pre-thought, premeditated.
Dungeon Master 01:59:26 The plans of a man who had hundreds of years to hate where he lived. Tinthirion went mad. He waged war. He died. He tried to die. He came back. How does that fit for you? Kaladin, you are a puzzle piece. You are not the only puzzle.
Dungeon Master 01:59:50 person who can do what you do you are just unfortunately the last living person who can do what you do you are the last the bloodline of the fey courts the rightful heir Zario could also do it funny enough she points at Cletus and Cyrus she goes twin souls also can do it and funnily enough
Dungeon Master 02:00:16 Last but not least, she looks at Leopold. She goes, you were never meant to do it, but your former father, a man hell-bent on abuse, has allowed you to do it. Each of you capable of ruling the Feywild. Fascinating, right? You are all
Dungeon Master 02:00:42 happen to be people capable of doing the same job you happen to find each other and you happen to make your way to the tree of death how does that work she goes i've rambled please fill in please talk um this is a conversation not the dictation sits back starts sipping on her tea
Leopold Magnus 02:00:55 Oh, dear. No, I have no idea what you're talking about, lady.
Cyrus Schwert 02:01:09 Wow. Wow, she ripped me one. Holy shit.
Dungeon Master 02:01:11 She goes, Leopold, you were abused. You were a child forced into a teenager, an adult forced to kill, and now you inhabit the body of a killing machine. You are the definition of charity for kids in need. You are the most sad soul I've ever seen. Deep.
Kaladen Shash 02:01:27 Prior to this.
Leopold Magnus 02:01:30 Oh, I haven't even made my wish yet. Oh, well. Was that a freebie? I haven't even asked my question yet.
Dungeon Master 02:01:39 And then I say something that wasn't through. She looks like a little offended. She goes, I speak through there. This is all part of it, right? Zara is dead. I got what I wanted. I made it funny.
Cyrus Schwert 02:01:44 Sure.
Kaladen Shash 02:01:56 Prior to this, had we suspected that the Mad King was also my uncle? Was that one and the same? I had not. Is that new knowledge to us? Right. What was that, Jesse? Oh, we knew my uncle was related to me.
Dungeon Master 02:02:07 Up to you if you put that together. I've never said it.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:11 I thought we discussed that. I thought we discussed that. I thought that we discussed that he was at least related to you. Yeah, that makes sense.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:24 I don't know if we had said the Mad King, the uncle, the same. Uncle, yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:02:33 I haven't said that in campaign lore that your uncle, the guy who claimed to be your uncle in your dreams was the cursed king. But I think his generally creepy and evil demeanor kind of pointed to it. And Jesse is always very good at just like addressing the blunt facts that I throw out that nobody really says. He'll say something like, so we know this guy is evil, right? Like it was one of those conversations.
Kaladen Shash 02:03:02 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:08 Am I still floating immediate Casper? Or am I back in the cauldron? OK. All right. Boo. I'm a ghost.
Dungeon Master 02:03:12 Mm-hmm. You are Azariel Cather in this moment. Nope. You are there for the conversation.
Leopold Magnus 02:03:15 All right.
Cyrus Schwert 02:03:28 I have a question. What makes us five the ones that are capable of this? What is it about us? It's too late for me. I'm awake now.
Dungeon Master 02:03:46 That's a good question. Very good question. Cyrus is paying attention. All of you are sleeping. Cyrus is awake. Year 3000 and such. How are you all the person? Kaladin, she flicks his long ears, directly descended the Fae. He's obviously High Elf. His dads are High Elf. Eventually there was an Archfey in there. An Archfey from a court.
Dungeon Master 02:04:17 You, Cyrus, not directly fey, but did you believe that you went from going to classes to working on an almond farm? No. Letus, bonded to you in soul, you are twin spirits, born on the same moon, not the same day, but the same setting. Spirits came from the other realm, on the same boat, so to speak.
Dungeon Master 02:04:48 The fact that you found each other, your powers awakened. There is a realm in the Fae that used to exist where the two rulers were brothers, twins, born on the same moon, obviously on the same day. Happen chance that you found each other? No. Back to the main point. Tentherian plotting man.
Dungeon Master 02:05:15 working behind the scenes, pulling strings that I forgot existed. And events have been triggered where you stumbled into Cletus, who stumbled into Donny Ratshit Farsight, who sent directly to Kaladin. What does a man who has more intelligence than any other being think of? How do I maximize my ability to succeed? When he died,
Dungeon Master 02:05:43 or was shunted to the Astral Sea, the failsafe enacted. Kaladin, your parents gave you life. Cyrus, your family moved from the East Dome to the South Dome before the wars ever started, your bloodline started. He had plotted out individuals of significance once the curse was born, individuals that could reverse it.
Dungeon Master 02:06:12 under his control. I should also break the news to you that he needed a vessel. You were each intended to be a vessel to some extent. He takes over the one who can rule the Fae, he rules the Fae. You guys haven't been home in a while, so he had to find somebody else. Wonder why he hasn't been bothering you lately, Kaladin? No, you're not.
Dungeon Master 02:06:42 leans back again. So to answer your question, you were always going to be a person who could, but you are the person who can because somebody wanted you to be. Next, who wants to know?
Cyrus Schwert 02:06:59 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:07:07 She's sort of scanning around, around Kaladin, around Leopold. She circles back to Zariel's ghost nipples. She goes back up. She's just kind of pointing. One's the null.
Kaladen Shash 02:07:16 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:07:22 Oh, um, well, to be honest, I was generally wondering, um, I don't very much know who I am. And, uh, I know that somebody, somebody important to me kept me, kept me, uh, in prison anyways. Do you know anything about who I am?
Dungeon Master 02:07:45 Leopold, you are a product of an accident. Sorry to say. I know. Let me brighten it up. You are not an accident. You were just not intended to be the way you are. Your old master, do you remember him much? Or should I give you a little freshening on who you are?
Leopold Magnus 02:08:12 Oh, to be honest, maybe just some images, but I don't remember much.
Dungeon Master 02:08:18 So he goes, nah, let me look around. And she is like diving for stuff. She pulls out like a feather, like ostrich feather duster, like classic made one, and like brushes your head really aggressively. And she goes, think on that now. I think you'll have better memory of certain things in your life. Just a little dusty in there, you know. And you have.
Dungeon Master 02:08:40 like tenfold memories of what you have, which still isn't a ton because you had almost nothing to start with, but you have these flashbacks and images and stills in your mind where your neurons are now connecting of you and your brother being adopted after your parents died in the Cursed War. You don't know how they died, but they died from the Cursed War. You were adopted by a lord with the last name Windrider.
Dungeon Master 02:09:09 This figure almost instantly dropped the facade and you realized as you grew older, because you were just a child, that you were being basically honed to perfect yourself. You were trained in the arcane. Your brother was trained in the fighting stance, you know, physical and mind. How far could they be pushed to the edge? This figure later kind of just disregarded you both.
Kaladen Shash 02:09:12 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:09:39 Um, your brother died in the war. He was very bloodthirsty. You know, he joined, you don't know much else. And eventually he was taken out, but he was a very fearsome warrior. Um, and you were also in the war, but you were more of a caster support role, the best on the side that you were on. You don't intentionally, it's not being relayed to you what side that was, but eventually you died as well. You were an adult. You were not a child.
Dungeon Master 02:10:07 You had lived a life very hard and gruesome, training in the basement on things just to reinforce your magic. But before that, this individual had become obsessed with the concept of immortality. They had played around with the idea of, could you imbue a soul into artificial form to live forever?
Kaladen Shash 02:10:10 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:10:35 and they had designed this suit of armor that was like the perfect defender, and they were going to put themselves in it. You died before it happened, and you have now a new memory that you didn't have before of when you first woke up on the table. Well, you woke up in a tunnel, but you now have a memory before that of
Dungeon Master 02:10:58 You see a figure that you now recognize is the current Lord of Advancement in Nunu Arbor, Lord Calmera Windrider. Like, in a dark necromantic ritual, he is pulling your soul...
Dungeon Master 02:11:20 um out of a coffin um and it's like it looks gruesome it's like he's pulling the soul out of the skeleton and he places it into this suit of armor um obviously he doesn't need to do it to himself something happened um and it is in his mind everything is going perfect and then you say something for the first time and it's leopold's very endearing classic
Dungeon Master 02:11:49 You know, chirp of, oh, dear, like, where am I? And he realizes instantly that he did not put your brother's soul into the suit of armor, that you, a magic caster, have been given this invincible, unstopping killing suit.
Dungeon Master 02:12:07 as your embodiment and once he realizes that he wipes your mind and you don't remember anything else and the next thing you remember is waking up disregarded in a tunnel system below the city with zariel sort of working on your inner parts
Dungeon Master 02:12:24 breaking a sweat, just this really unassuming man, um, hard worked, probably doesn't go out a whole lot covered in grease from working on like the emerging technology that the city is trying to transition to, uh, had thought to give this abandoned suit of armor with technology and a chance at life. Um, you were accidentally put into your brother's suit of armor. Um,
Dungeon Master 02:12:53 And you now are... You are supposed to be Victor Bonecrusher. You were brother, but you are obviously Leopold instead. And you have all of this flashing through your mind as she is sort of like chatting with Zariel's ghost. It's just about how the spirit realm feels, sipping on her tea. And eventually, when you've sort of stopped recalling all this information, she goes...
Dungeon Master 02:13:21 Leopold you're back with us right you are here in this moment she goes I hope you understand who you are or rather who you were because and she like goes to touch your suit of armor and she like
Leopold Magnus 02:13:26 Oh, dear. Oh, dear. You just saw like my visor just kind of like strobing as I just stared aimlessly straight ahead, coming back into reality.
Dungeon Master 02:13:51 forces the sense of i'm doing this to be dangerous on it and um as she reaches for your suit like automatically throws out a blade it cuts off her finger and she goes and her finger grows back as she goes and finishes touching your arm and she goes i think you need to focus on yourself and what you could be because that is much more interesting
Leopold Magnus 02:14:19 Oh, well, um, I gotta say that feather really tickled something loose and I'm really, really taking a lot in, uh, Oh,
Dungeon Master 02:14:27 Yeah, I thought, thank you. I got this from a shaman in Redivere in the First Age. It's a pretty cool item, I think. Helps me remember when I forgot where I put my pens. I just give it a little dust and it works. They're in your abdomen. You swallowed them. I see them. She looks down. She's like, they're right there.
Leopold Magnus 02:14:45 Oh, yes, I will tell you what, I remember where I left my pens, that's for sure. Oh, yeah, yeah, I pull one out and it's got a rotisserie chicken chunk, like a drum leg stuck to it. Oh, yes, there's a lot of stuff in here.
Cyrus Schwert 02:14:56 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:15:03 Just like chicken's grip on it. Galadin, I think you're next. I haven't talked to you that much.
Zariel Torgan 02:15:04 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:15:10 Oh, but yes, thank you. You've given me a lot to think about. I mustn't take any more of your time. You've been very generous.
Kaladen Shash 02:15:27 It's been very quiet. You scared me a little bit. I guess the question is that
Dungeon Master 02:15:30 crosses one leg over the other and she goes the chosen one right inherent leader of the odiers charming face of the group not too bad looking yourself um boy born to be what can i help you with
Cyrus Schwert 02:15:39 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:15:57 Why does the Fae need a new lord? Like, why does the realm need something? And what will happen once there is new lord? Will... Please.
Dungeon Master 02:16:05 She goes, that's a good question. Do you mind if I tell you a story? Both past, present, and future. She goes, some of you know this out of game too. And she basically points to Rex instead of Leopold. She goes, they know what I mean. Anyway, let me tell you a story. There was a war before the war on a continent not on this one called the Gradovieres.
Leopold Magnus 02:16:23 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:16:34 A bunch of titans wanted to overthrow the gods. Yada, yada. A boy made a wish. The world changed. But before that, the Feywild had a meeting. All the lords, the animals, the insects, the flies. They met, they talked. They discussed. The Feywild was doomed if the material plane didn't survive.
Dungeon Master 02:17:03 How can the reflection exist if the mirror is broke? They agreed that in the short run of things, they would rather give so that they could get. They pooled their mana. They gifted it to the goddess of life before she left. Wonderful woman. Had tea with her. Jaya is fantastic. They
Dungeon Master 02:17:30 have been channeling their life force for thousands of years to the panterial plane in the wellsprings that you are familiar with. It has robbed the Feywild of its nutrients. It is a desolate wasteland. It is chaotic as evil. It is evil. They only did this on one promise from the goddess, that she would change reality to reflect this. Eventually,
Dungeon Master 02:17:57 a lord would be born of the Fae who could reunite the court, don the crown, and bring back the vitality of the Fae. What the Jeya did not tell them is that when a certain mage of the West Dome learned about this many years later that he
Dungeon Master 02:18:22 instrumentally coordinated the assassination of every major bloodline in the Fae. With the exception of a few. So the Fae did not get their promised lord in the time that they wanted. The Fae has continued to suffer. Any side royalty has since faded into non-existence. But there is still the promise of this prophecy. And that is where you come in.
Dungeon Master 02:18:54 When you march your cute little tushes down the bridge into the center of the tree, you fight the monster guarding it, of course. Otherwise, how could this be an adventure? Silas knows what I'm talking about. He lives for this shit. You beat the little baddie. You get to do the prophecy. You put your little bodies in the tree. The tree eats you. You are teleported to the Feywild.
Dungeon Master 02:19:23 In the Feywild right now, there is a troupe of not so different characters meeting, discussing how they are going to usher the Lord from their tree to the other tree, to be reborn. That is the prophecy. What they are not going to expect, and what I encourage you to do to further your own potential,
Dungeon Master 02:19:48 As each of you get in that tree. Each of you do this threat rule. Who cares who's supposed to be lord. Kaladin will be king. Cyrus will be prince. Who fucking cares. You make the rules now. But you will be. Immobile for a while. While this group brings you. To the destination. Then you will be born. You will have extra power.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:02 you
Dungeon Master 02:20:17 I think fair trade. You lose your body, you be reborn as yourself, but better. It's kind of just as simple as that. Prophecies are vague. They don't interest me. I want facts. You keep going. You fight. You win. You get reward. Question.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:45 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:20:48 No, this will then restore the vitality of the Phaedron. To do this. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:20:54 Will it give you the ability to restore the vitality of the Faerum? You gathered in very specifically the most powerful of the Faer courts, both Seelie and Unseelie. She looks at Leopold. I'm talking about you. Is what is called the Eternal Court. It is...
Dungeon Master 02:21:16 The most Archfey of the Archfey. They were spirits before they were elves. After they were elves, they were immortal. You are from this line of great men. When you become reborn as Truffey, long ears, tall form, you will have what is called the Twilight Weave.
Dungeon Master 02:21:42 Nobody else would be born with this specific crown. So you doing it is very important. Other people doing it is just bonus. I would love to tell you about the Twilight Weave more than that, but I just don't think that's sort of in the bargaining price. That's Farewell to a Different Realm. I had to spend time there to learn that. It's worth a little bit extra if you sort of look at your arm
Kaladen Shash 02:22:07 I put my pinky up.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:13 Take a little bit.
Dungeon Master 02:22:13 In an instant, she reaches out, like before you can see, and she rips off your finger, and it doesn't grow back. And she's just holding it. She goes, now the twilight weave is the crown to unite the crowns. You have direct control, if you will it, of the different realms of the Fae. You could, if so facto, reverse the flow of magic. Currently, the Wellsprings feed the domes.
Dungeon Master 02:22:42 You reverse it, domes cease to exist, but you guys have survived this long. It's not like the cities will instantly fall. People will learn to defend themselves. This is just a continent. Rumors of evil were spread by religious fanatics, not willing to be forced with reality that they are being bottle-fed fey magic, not divine magic. Kind of ruffles their feathers.
Leopold Magnus 02:23:13 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:23:14 I don't think I had any other. Oh, yeah. She's in my dreams and she laughs at me for not remembering who she is.
Dungeon Master 02:23:20 Kaladin, do you ever think about her? The woman, do you think about her? Because you don't know her yet. She, in the Fae, lives in a time both future and past. She is...
Dungeon Master 02:23:44 if she had been born in the golden age of the Fae, would have been a respectable sign of the court. Fae Lara, unfortunately, lives a life of war now, defending this ancient prophecy. And she goes, let me show you, though. And she takes a big draw on her pipe, and she blows it into the cauldron, and it kind of steams up, giving you this wall to have a vision. And we are teleported to
Cyrus Schwert 02:23:52 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:24:14 what is currently happening in the Feywild. There is like a cart drawn by large hares that like kind of slowly hop into this grove and you see a large towering elephant-like form get out in sort of
Cyrus Schwert 02:24:24 You.
Dungeon Master 02:24:34 kind of in secrecy kind of usher themselves into this secret grove and as they all meet up it's not the time yet the plan isn't being enacted but you see a group of uh six uh well five individuals um meeting with a woman in beautiful but very battle-worn
Dungeon Master 02:25:00 gold elven type armor she's got long flowing black hair on just one side because one side of her head is shaven down to the scalp and you see visible scars and everything on sort of her side cut she's got a fair face that's been marked with like very key stars to give her the appearance of a battle-hardened fey woman um
Dungeon Master 02:25:24 Fae Lara, it doesn't look as you know her. She's not this mysterious, unconscious girl wearing a mask. But you see she has a mask that kind of hangs at her chest when it's not on her face. And she's got this full body suit of armor that's kind of over cloaked.
Dungeon Master 02:25:41 with like just the shawl of green, like this emerald green that's faded. She has this huge sword holstered at her side when it should be on her back. It's so big, but one of her arms kind of rests on it and holds it forward so it doesn't hit the ground. And she's in conversation with this Loxodon gentleman also in full plate as they sort of talk and meet and they kind of walk into there before she disperses the smoke and
Dungeon Master 02:26:11 This old, wrinkled, horrid face of black ichor and scars leans in as you are looking at this image. And she goes, girl in thee, she is preparing for your arrival. She's seen the signs that obviously you enacted, right? It was you who awoke your powers, not the mysterious form. Regardless, she prepares for your arrival.
Dungeon Master 02:26:41 The King of the Courts is coming. It's good that she thought to bring her friends because I really, like I said, I hope the rest of you go along. That would be a fun trip. Yes, the Guardian.
Kaladen Shash 02:26:58 Is there anything else we should know as we approach the three? You said we will face a monster?
Dungeon Master 02:27:08 Let me outline it. She takes your map and she puts it down and she starts scribbling on it. And you didn't realize that she had access to your map. It wasn't like out in front of you, but she grabs it anyway. And she goes, we've already made it through the Sharwood. So your next step is to go through the Emberwick Crossing. That's the safe path between the Sharwood and the Black Ruth Hollow. That is mostly just a passageway. The real goal.
Cyrus Schwert 02:27:19 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:27:35 is for you to end up in what is called the cindered cradle, the center of the tree. And she goes, ah, my brain, it spaces. You guys kind of wanted to know about this area. All you wanted to know why this came to be. It was one of your first questions. There were no tree of deaths or tree of lives to start with. That's just the name given to them by the Anduvian. They were just...
Cyrus Schwert 02:27:56 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:28:05 Celestial Trees A long time ago, but after the First War, a certain devil who goes by the alias of Rhiannon decided that he wanted to see if he could escape the Hells. He opened the portal in the tree. The tree was sealed by magic unknown to him.
Dungeon Master 02:28:26 Unfortunately, now the tree burns eternally with the fires of hell, and you could more or less go to hell if you wanted to through the tree. Pretty safe passage, actually. Follow the roots now. But the tree now has certain properties. Guarding the entrance to hell, and unfortunately for you, the entrance to the Feywild,
Cyrus Schwert 02:28:38 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:28:51 is the ascended guardian and she goes i would show you a picture but i don't have one and she kind of holds up um like a little pin cushion figurine that kind of resembles group like it's a little in a humanoid figure with like just raggedy branches and stuff she's like this but then it catches on fire she goes but a little more crispy that's what you're going to fight and she like throws it and it disappears off in the corner
Dungeon Master 02:29:17 She goes, I'll get that later. You see like some smoke rising from the corner. She goes, there's no fun in spoiling it either, but it's pretty strong. For some more body parts, I'd tell you more about it.
Cyrus Schwert 02:29:37 What exactly was a pinky going to suffice for this last vial of water from the wellspring? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:29:46 Oh, you want the water too? I forgot. And she smiles a wicked grin to let them know that she absolutely didn't forget. She got what she wanted in the first deal. She got Kaladin's pinky. And now, like, she kind of needs more before she'll give you more. She goes, I wonder what I could get, you know. She brushes Kaladin's full arm with her super long, spindly arm. She goes, orange. She kind of looks at your chest. She goes, what do you have, Cyrus?
Kaladen Shash 02:30:11 Which arm?
Cyrus Schwert 02:30:18 Um, I mean, I've got a body like everybody else. Um, you could, you could have a tooth. Right. I'd let you pull a tooth. Tooth.
Dungeon Master 02:30:25 You have two arms, two nipples, two belly buttons, like all of us. I understand. Yes. About teeth. I don't want a tooth. I'll let you keep your body for as long as it lives. And then as soon as it dies, I want it.
Zariel Torgan 02:30:31 Ha ha ha.
Kaladen Shash 02:30:53 Get more, get more for that.
Dungeon Master 02:30:54 No coming back. You can have your soul. Keep it. I want the body. Just when it's time. I won't force it. I'm not cruel. But when you die, I'll come knocking. I love pinky promises. She pinky promises and her pinky wraps around your pinky twice. It's just awful. And it just lights up over and over.
Cyrus Schwert 02:31:03 Okay. Thank you, promise. I love that. Okay. Thanks. I just want to go on the vacation is all.
Dungeon Master 02:31:24 So he goes, great. I'm sorry, what was the question? Oh, you want the vials. He goes, here you go. You're welcome. That's fair. It's like I thought or something. Well, then, any other questions, gentlemen? I told you the past. I told you the present.
Cyrus Schwert 02:31:35 Sounds neat. I mean, I feel good. Probably.
Kaladen Shash 02:31:36 you you
Zariel Torgan 02:31:57 Do we want to ask something on Cletus's behalf? And he can give up an udder, right? Do we just want to wait until he's here and say, what would you have asked? And just retcon it? Or...
Dungeon Master 02:31:58 I'll give you... Yes. Yeah. He hasn't gotten anything yet, so he can... This will be like his thing. What do you guys want on Trace's behalf?
Cyrus Schwert 02:32:08 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:32:08 Uh huh.
Leopold Magnus 02:32:30 It makes sense to me, but maybe it messes up the flow.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:34 Yeah, I don't know.
Dungeon Master 02:32:39 Um, I'll say she would go, Gleetus isn't really here right now. He's being played by somebody else, but I'll give you something. I'll give you a scroll. The scroll can do some things. And she writes on it, um, message information lore.
Kaladen Shash 02:32:52 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:33:09 She goes, pick one. When Cletus is back, he can ask me a question. Deal. And she goes, oh, yes, I forgot. Real quick, and she kisses the bottom of the scroll, and you see her name pops up in the lips. Baba Yaga is an option, too. She goes, that one's for free. You want some information on me, I'll give it to you.
Cyrus Schwert 02:33:18 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:19 Now give me that dragonborn body.
Kaladen Shash 02:33:33 No.
Dungeon Master 02:33:39 I like this group. You kind of just give me what I want without asking too much. Most people make a deal. She gives you a little Korean heart. She goes, thank you. And then she grabs your ghost head, Zariel, and she goes, down you go. And she kind of like, looks like she's drowning your ghost for a little bit. Like your hands are kind of on the cauldron and she pushes it in all the way. And she goes, she starts like stirring the whole thing around. She goes,
Cyrus Schwert 02:33:50 Holy hell. All the marbles.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:50 Alright.
Dungeon Master 02:34:08 who wants to see what comes out? And she kind of cackles, and Jesse, go ahead and roll me a D100. And you can roll it another time if you don't like it, or you can pick the race above or below on the table. You get
Kaladen Shash 02:34:18 let's go i want this to be something goofy 47. okay
Cyrus Schwert 02:34:22 Not one gnome.
Zariel Torgan 02:34:24 All right. D100. All right. It's overforged. I'm going to.
Dungeon Master 02:34:38 Either option, but not both. 55. Okay. I won't tell you what the one above and below is, but I'll tell you...
Dungeon Master 02:34:51 What it is, you are in this stew of souls. You're pushed into a different realm. You're like spirit is going down the funnel of all of these souls that have made deals with the Baba Yaga in the same instant that you have. She has woven herself into the fabric of reality. She is kind of everywhere she wants to be.
Zariel Torgan 02:34:54 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:35:11 You see all these people losing their lives to her as she is not so generous in a different realm or a different day. And as they're spiraling down, you see that a body starts to rise up out of it towards you. And it is a male or female, whatever you want, but half elven form.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:35 Interesting. So I'd look kind of like Kaladin. OK. But I don't know what the next option is.
Kaladen Shash 02:35:43 You look more like Cyrus. That's fun. Yep, too conventional.
Dungeon Master 02:35:43 You would look like Cyrus, but as you look like as a human, Zariel's original form. Or you can reject it and take the next option. But you don't know what the next option is. Half elf or something else. Do you want above and below options or are you doing a reroll?
Cyrus Schwert 02:35:44 More like Cyrus.
Zariel Torgan 02:36:01 I feel like half health is too mainstream. So if I do above and below, do I get to see both options? Or if I reroll, I just get whatever I roll? All right. Well, I feel like if I do the above or below, then I have a better chance of getting something fun than if I just rerolled and got one specific thing. So I'll do above and below.
Kaladen Shash 02:36:14 really raw yeah
Dungeon Master 02:36:18 I'll tell you what both are. Yeah. Okay. The half elf body doesn't go completely away. It goes down to a point and two other forms pop up next to it. You can either be a rock gnome or a half orc.
Cyrus Schwert 02:36:23 No, no, no.
Zariel Torgan 02:36:43 All right. I'm not going to look up what a rock gnome is. I'm just going to go with it. I'm going to go with my gut.
Kaladen Shash 02:36:47 Be the no, man. That was so much fun last campaign. Be in Tiny's ride. You're going to get so many buffs for magic, dude, as a freaking druid. Forced.
Cyrus Schwert 02:37:03 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:37:06 I'll give you something, because the rock gnome, I think, is not as good as the forest gnome. So if you really hate this, you can pick the other one, but...
Zariel Torgan 02:37:14 Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:37:19 Rock Gnome, your constitution score increases by one. You get Artificer's Lore. Whenever you make an intelligence history check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you can add your proficiency twice instead of any normal one. You get Tinkering Proficiency, Clockwork Joy,
Cyrus Schwert 02:37:37 you
Dungeon Master 02:37:40 clockwork toy sorry you um you get a little clockwork animal monster or person such as a frog mouse bergen dragon or soldier when placed on the ground the toy moves five feet across the ground on each of your turns in random directions it makes noise appropriate to the creature it represents you also um get a fire starter and a music box random shit
Zariel Torgan 02:38:04 What does the half work at, though? Because that didn't sound very exciting.
Cyrus Schwert 02:38:08 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:38:10 Half orc get the relentless endurance. Whenever you would normally be reduced to zero hit points, you pop up with one instead. That's like a once a day thing. You get strength score increased by two, con increased by one. You have medium build, but I believe you get powerful build.
Dungeon Master 02:38:31 You get dark vision, which rock gnomes also get, and you get proficiency in intimidation. Oh, savage attacks. When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you roll one of the weapon's damage dice an additional time. So you would roll, instead of two damage dice, three damage dice. Oh, that worked better, but...
Zariel Torgan 02:38:35 Hmm. All right, I'll take the. Yeah, I'll take the I'll take the half work. Can I pick the color?
Kaladen Shash 02:38:49 Three of them.
Dungeon Master 02:39:01 Okay, we haven't seen Zariel as a half-orc yet. I was going to say, half-orcs and human are normally the same, essentially. What does Zariel's half-orc form look like? And again, half-orcs don't exist in the world today. If you're like Kaladin with his fey ears, you're going to stick out like a sore thumb being like a pureblood half-orc.
Cyrus Schwert 02:39:04 It's greed and faith.
Zariel Torgan 02:39:11 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:39:26 Like more orc than ham hock. Oh, she's over. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:39:30 Hamhawk is a ogre, but, like, yes, Hamhawk still looks very human. She just has, like,
Cyrus Schwert 02:39:37 What are you doing in my swamp?
Dungeon Master 02:39:38 You know, you can tell her skin is thick, like she has more of a hide than skin. Her rolls kind of are, like, huge, and she's got, like, her bottom teeth protrude out a little bit. Her bite is really uneven to make her look like an ogre, essentially. Zariel would just be, like, straight up different skin tone, blunted but pointed ears. He would be, like, a full foot taller than most average people. Like, he would have huge tusks. Like, he would be affable.
Kaladen Shash 02:40:07 Right on. Nothing we've seen. Wow.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:10 Do I get to make any of these decisions, or do I get to give some ideas? All right. So I'd like to be a really dark, vibrant green with a bit of lighter green highlights and naturally occurring lighter spots on my body. I'd like to have obsidian black tusks.
Dungeon Master 02:40:14 Yeah, just give me a star you'll look like as a half-orc. Ooh. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:40:38 You just had the male pattern baldness, like horseshoe.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:40 instead of white, if that's allowed. And then I don't know if orcs have any hair, but I just want to be bald. Well, I think it's funnier for my character, because I was self-conscious about being bald as a robot. And so still need a hat. It's just like, here.
Dungeon Master 02:40:49 they can have both to fault um
Kaladen Shash 02:40:56 Yeah. Still looking for a hat. Still looking for a hat. The trick just carries forward.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:08 Yeah, it's like that's in your soul. It's not getting fixed. Other than that, I'm cool. Or fixed.
Dungeon Master 02:41:20 Okay. Yeah, no chance that you're not. She pulls this deep green body out of this pauldron that fits your form as she pulls it out, and her arm just keeps moving until the full form is out of the color, just like getting longer as she pulls you up, puts it down, and she goes, I took some artistic liberties. I saw that Zariel prefers to be bald, so this half-orc also has no hair. And, uh,
Cyrus Schwert 02:41:20 Are you fully nude right now? That makes sense.
Dungeon Master 02:41:50 my teeth are black his teeth are black I think it's a good touch he gives it a smack on the ass and you see that Zariel always had like he had like a green glow in the core of his being that was very nature infused and
Dungeon Master 02:42:05 when she hits you on the ass, your chest like explodes with that green light and Zario up until this point, all memories of your, that you had in lock of your previous life into your human, into your war forged life come to you. You don't lose anything in the process. Um,
Cyrus Schwert 02:42:11 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:42:24 You have all your abilities, classes, everything like that, but racial traits are now half orc. Things like that differ in your stat spread, but you are just half orc Zarya. I told you I made it fun, right? You didn't believe me at the time because I had just killed him, and I understand that, but it was fun, though.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:38 Nice. I gotta make that. He just came out looking like a fucking monster. Yeah, well.
Kaladen Shash 02:42:39 Okay, that is not like what I expected to see. Kind of crazy. Used to be metal. Now you. Never seen anything like it. Maybe this is better. No, thank you. Look at this. Look at this sweet arm. You don't let this go?
Cyrus Schwert 02:42:52 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:42:58 I'll kill you if you'd like. You want to die? Yes. Like I said, very beautiful. I love the arm. I'd kill you any day if you want. You just call me. We work out the details. Okay. That's what I live for.
Kaladen Shash 02:43:15 That's creepy. Okay. I'll keep in mind. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:43:17 Can I get a pants? Can I get that cloak?
Dungeon Master 02:43:25 so we are meeting adjourned right we are no longer doing business you're not going to give me your souls or body parts or information and i don't feel like talking anymore really so um would you like to get out oh skinny club yes yes yes
Kaladen Shash 02:43:44 Yes, I need the free clock.
Zariel Torgan 02:43:45 I do believe I own the cloak.
Dungeon Master 02:43:48 She lifts up her arm and it's on a rack of heck hangers. You see a spray of five different skins. But you can fully tell who the person was. It is their arm...
Dungeon Master 02:44:03 getting stitched into their body into their leg and it's like still has arm hair and like pubes and their face outline is like stitched into it and spread out and like one is like the body of a devil and she's like this one lets you uh be resistant to fire this one it's like
Zariel Torgan 02:44:16 Awesome.
Dungeon Master 02:44:22 the skin of a dragon scale with white hide she's like the resistance to cold this one it's like a shapeling uh like a shifter body she's like this one kind of will hide your form um there's like a uh one of the um slopes is like five gnome or halfling bodies stitched together she's like this one i find this kind of lucky sometimes it's um they all do various things
Zariel Torgan 02:44:51 It's lucky sometimes. Just going to throw that out there. Do I get to know what they do? Or do I get to just pick one? Is the...
Dungeon Master 02:44:57 That's my favorite. It's like a cloak of protection, like a cloak of elven kind, essentially, where it kind of makes you silent and more stealthy in the darkness. There'd be like one cloak for each damage resistance type, and then the one that's the lucky one would give you like... There's the...
Dungeon Master 02:45:25 the magical item that gives you the ability to, I forget what it's called right now. It'll come to me in a little bit. People have disadvantage on hitting you until they hit you and then it doesn't work anymore. And that activates after every sort of combat ends kind of deal. So you're just harder to hit until they make contact. Cool. I figured you'd want the five halflings stitched together.
Zariel Torgan 02:45:46 I want that one. Yeah, it's like the thing that Kaladin does. It's that spell. Yeah, it's like you've got three dudes. Oh, yeah. Is it blur or is it mirror image?
Kaladen Shash 02:45:54 Yeah. It's almost more like blur. But yeah, that's a mirror image. That's what you're saying. Well, mirror image is what I cast all the time. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:45:55 That's horrid. What's up?
Dungeon Master 02:45:59 Book of Displacement, I think is what it's called.
Dungeon Master 02:46:14 It's one that he normally casts, but it's called the Cloak of Disguise, I'm pretty sure. Basically just everything, when you start combat, when somebody goes to hit you, you have basically advantage on not being hit until they make contact. Once that's been broken down, it just needs to reset. It's a pretty sweet item. But hers just looks really horrid.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:18 Okay. Okay. All right, sweet.
Kaladen Shash 02:46:38 That's cool. And then do we all get it? Does everyone else get a cloak as well? Is it just the elements now? It's the one. That's perfect. That's all right.
Dungeon Master 02:46:47 Nope. Nope, it's just the one that asked for it. You get one thing. She gets up and she just walks away. She kind of like hobbles into a different room.
Cyrus Schwert 02:47:04 All right. Okay, Baba. We have a scroll for now.
Kaladen Shash 02:47:14 OK, that was cool. We're going to leave now. Is there an easy way to get hold of you? I mean, I don't want to interrupt what you're starting here. OK, that's not creepy.
Dungeon Master 02:47:16 See you, dear. It was great to meet you. Next time we'll be on better terms. I'm rather here. I'm there. If you die, I'll come. I'm the witch of the woods. I'll find you, kind of deal. I'll find you.
Zariel Torgan 02:47:19 It's,
Dungeon Master 02:47:44 Just send the message from me. I'll be all right. Even if I'm not around, I'm around. Okay, we go. I'm going to get paid. As soon as you guys get up, the whole house shifts forward and you kind of roll into the action. So it gets up and it like kind of walks away pretty quickly. It's just like moving away.
Cyrus Schwert 02:47:57 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:47:57 Okay, we'll walk out. We'll leave.
Dungeon Master 02:48:13 with the pace and eventually you just realize you stopped hearing the tree shift and like it's just gone you look down and there's no evidence that the footprints are ever there and so then as you guys would keep moving you go um across the bridge and we haven't had a whole lot of rolls this time but next set of challenges um
Dungeon Master 02:48:38 There are going to be another set of three perception checks, but everybody is going to make the check each time. And I'll explain why. But as you guys start crossing the large route that bridges the space between, everybody go ahead and give me a perception check.
Kaladen Shash 02:49:08 Um, the hero's feast. Is it just advantage on wisdom checks or is it, what does it give us? I didn't mean to roll that with advantage. I'll just take the nine. The first one was the first one rolled. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:49:09 Was it saving throws or was it checks?
Dungeon Master 02:49:18 I believe so. Check. All wisdom check. I think it's both. Yeah, the higher one. The first one. The 15. Okay. Yeah, I got you. That came out really crass. I realized when I said it.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:19 I think it's advantage on wisdom. Yeah, it's wisdom based. 17.
Kaladen Shash 02:49:40 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:49:46 10, 15, 17. There's only three of you, so I'll roll for Cletus. 13. It is a... Okay. Nobody beats a 20, correct? Correct.
Kaladen Shash 02:50:12 No.
Zariel Torgan 02:50:14 Mm-mm.
Dungeon Master 02:50:15 You guys are walking across and you see at first it's like just really hard to tell what it is. It almost looks like humanoid forms.
Leopold Magnus 02:50:16 Nope.
Dungeon Master 02:50:26 But it's just like swirling mist, really intangible. It just resembles it for a second. And then like as you're walking across, the forms are a little bit more solid. And you're like, that's definitely a person up there. And you see the form turn and fall off the side of the route, disappearing into the mist below. When the form poofs through the fog cloud, you see like a bask of like orange red sort of
Dungeon Master 02:50:52 fire light kind of comes up briefly before it's covered back over um you see another one fall off and it's like always in front of you is it's when it's happening and you're kind of like carefully trudging along and then one of the forms is just like right in front of you and it's just like this mist shape but then it like grabs onto you and it tries to force you off the side i need everybody to give me a dexterity saving throw because you all failed
Cyrus Schwert 02:50:58 This is dire.
Kaladen Shash 02:51:19 Okay, okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:51:30 I'm not very dexterous.
Zariel Torgan 02:51:40 There.
Dungeon Master 02:51:48 Cletus technically rolled a 17+. Is this even better? No, it's still 17+. I got 18, 27, and 15. What did Leopold get? Oh, he got 13. 13.
Leopold Magnus 02:52:12 13. Yep.
Dungeon Master 02:52:16 Okay, we'll go highest couple first. So Cyrus and Kaladin, these sort of like intangible forms, like get you with some force and they go to like shove you off the side and then you just kind of push them and they just fall gently exploding down. Briefly, you see just like a distant ember glow from way far down. This is a deep pit, but you're fine. Cyrus, you do the same thing. Push off the side.
Dungeon Master 02:52:46 The other two were 15 and 13. 15 is the DC you needed, but it's close. Azariel, you are being shoved by this form, and you slide off the back, but as Azariel falls...
Dungeon Master 02:53:06 In your new, like, very strong and, like, athletic form, your, like, half-orc arm reaches out, catches the root instantly, and, like, digs into the material with your sort of pointed, like, nub-pointed claws. Like, pointed nails, but fingers. Catch in, break into it with your new inherent strength, and you're able to sort of catch yourself and keep from falling. I need one more dexterity saving throw from Leopold.
Cyrus Schwert 02:53:13 you
Zariel Torgan 02:53:30 you
Dungeon Master 02:53:35 If you fail the DC, which is 15, by more than five, Leopold falls to his death. If you fail by less than five, Leopold is falling, but the party has a chance to save him. Otherwise, Leopold catches and he can pull himself up.
Leopold Magnus 02:53:53 Oh, I don't know if I like that preposition. Oh, it was 15. So, uh,
Kaladen Shash 02:53:55 yeah it's like i only just learned who i am that's all right that's that's that's yeah that's that's within five
Cyrus Schwert 02:53:56 Okay, it's not by more than five, though.
Dungeon Master 02:54:05 Leopold tumbles off the back and he starts falling, but he sort of buys him enough time in his initial falling where somebody is constantly slipping, but they're staying upright. He's falling slow at first, grabbing a lot of things as his form kind of tumbles. And as he falls, he's got just enough time that somebody can do something to keep him from falling.
Kaladen Shash 02:54:29 Can I just, as a reaction, just cast Lightning Lord? I'll sculpt it so that he doesn't take any lightning damage, but I'll still whip him. Yeah. I don't think you want to resist it. You can just auto-fail to skill check.
Dungeon Master 02:54:39 does no damage, and it pulls them towards you automatically. That's a pretty good use of that. I think that works, yeah. That's quick and airtight, catches them, pulls them back as part of the spell property. So Leopold goes to fall.
Leopold Magnus 02:54:49 And I'm just like slowly waving my arms and I'm like about to fall.
Cyrus Schwert 02:54:55 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:55:05 gives you enough time in how slow he kind of falls that you turn around, you whip out after shaking this form from you, hit him around the waist, and you yank him up by his inner gear and clockwork. Your lightning lure misses the armor plates and kind of just bends him up the wall a little bit, pulls him onto the top of the roots safe. You guys, at this point, have made it halfway across.
Kaladen Shash 02:55:10 Sweet.
Cyrus Schwert 02:55:36 You almost fucking died, dude. You seem super chill right now.
Leopold Magnus 02:55:37 Well, thank you, Kaladin. I don't know if I would have made it. To be honest, down there does not look good. Oh, these two left feet. I'll never be more careful.
Kaladen Shash 02:55:47 Yes, no problem. Be careful. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:56:00 Can I just... Can I just add that
Leopold Magnus 02:56:05 Oh, died? You think that's what would have happened if I went down there? Oh, yes. I can't say that would have been good.
Cyrus Schwert 02:56:11 Just peek down there. Can't even see the bottom. Yeah, I do.
Dungeon Master 02:56:16 A little smoke out of a skull kind of pops up, which is really ominous. This is Leopold.
Zariel Torgan 02:56:28 I always thought that Leo was, like, weirdly optimistic because he was, like, a kid. But now we found out that this is his personality from when he was, like, a battle-hardened killer the whole time. He's just been this annoyingly optimistic forever. Yeah, that's great. That's good.
Kaladen Shash 02:56:37 Yes, yes. Oh, yes. This is his essence.
Leopold Magnus 02:56:39 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:56:43 And he isn't just supposed to be this person. He died and he just got brought back.
Zariel Torgan 02:56:58 That's awesome. Are we still trucking?
Cyrus Schwert 02:57:02 So another perception or?
Dungeon Master 02:57:03 You guys have one more leg. Yeah. And I just, you know, I just out of game metagaming know that there are flying abilities in the party, things like that. And if you wanted to take the chance on the role or do something different, but yeah, you've got one more leg where you would need to get across. Same thing. You see those forms in the distance. They're always intangible. So like,
Kaladen Shash 02:57:19 What kind of role are we making?
Dungeon Master 02:57:24 you throw some cantrips at it to test it, and you don't do damage. It's not like you can destroy them. You're just like, okay, I have to cross, and there's a chance that one of them tackles me. It's a perception check, and if you pass, it changes the dexterity saving throw.
Kaladen Shash 02:57:50 15. Omega strip. Yikes.
Zariel Torgan 02:57:50 So I rolled a 22. Nice. Oh no.
Dungeon Master 02:57:54 22. That is the success. You get advantage on your dexterity. 15 is a failure. You just make it straight. Cyrus fails so straight. Leopold fails so straight. Make it for Cleus. Almost a good number, but he failed. It was a 17 onto a 7. So he'll make it straight.
Leopold Magnus 02:58:04 Oh, thanks.
Cyrus Schwert 02:58:16 Come on Cletus.
Zariel Torgan 02:58:36 Yes.
Leopold Magnus 02:58:39 All right, so deck saving throw. Jeez. Rolling really poorly.
Kaladen Shash 02:58:40 Oh, God. I got 14. Okay. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:58:48 Okay. Zariel, you are fine. You shake it off. You make it to the end. You have the chance to interject if something bad happens, but in theory, Zariel has cleared it to the end. Paladin with the 16, same thing with you.
Dungeon Master 02:59:06 Cyrus with the 20, same thing with you. All of you shake these forms as another set goes to tackle you and push you in. Shake it off. You're on the move. You see that both Cletus and Leopold are pushed and are in the process of falling. There's going to be one more dexterity saving throw from both. Same rule. DC 15, fail by more than five. There is not an opportunity to save you.
Dungeon Master 02:59:34 Fail by less than five, there's an opportunity to save you. Give? No. Would you like to take a stress point? Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:59:37 Can I cast Enhance Ability in the middle of this? Or is this too late? Yes.
Zariel Torgan 02:59:54 Do it. All the cool kids are doing it.
Kaladen Shash 02:59:54 Oh, yes.
Leopold Magnus 02:59:59 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 03:00:00 In your inventory as a custom item or in your note section, write down that you have one stress point. If you don't already have one, just add it to the previous. And you can cast enhance ability. OK. And is that just advantage or is that a bonus?
Cyrus Schwert 03:00:11 OK. So I'll cast it at a level where I can do it on both of them. Can you say that again? My headphone is cutting out. Correct. It is advantage.
Zariel Torgan 03:00:30 It's advantage.
Dungeon Master 03:00:30 Is that advantage on the Thave, or is that a bonus? Ooh, good thing. One of Cletus's numbers was a four. 18.
Dungeon Master 03:00:51 Cletus goes to fall and just feels emboldened by your guys' shared connection that you didn't know you had. This just inherent tie in your souls that has yet to be explored feels empowered by you. And he catches the root before he falls with like the crook of his staff. So not even by his hand. He was past that point with that four and he kind of wraps the staff in and keeps himself up.
Cyrus Schwert 03:01:17 Mark.
Dungeon Master 03:01:20 What you got, Leopold? 16.
Leopold Magnus 03:01:24 All right, let's see. Oh, one looked pretty good. It was a 15, right? Nice.
Kaladen Shash 03:01:30 Yeah. Clear that bar.
Dungeon Master 03:01:33 Yeah, DC-15. Everybody clears. Also almost fall once again. Different side this time. You got up and got too cautious and just walked off the other end. You guys make it to the end, and as you go, we're getting right towards the end, so I'll set it up. We're going to have to do the encounter in person. It was supposed to be virtual, so I'll just...
Dungeon Master 03:01:56 draw the map. So we'll end next session with your guys' current characters, and then we'll jump into the Feywild for our main in-person thing. But as you guys go down what is called the Blackroot Hollow, it is this dense weave of various sizes of roots, all blackened because over the span of some thousand years, this tree has been burning with the fires of hell. But it is inherently celestial and divine in nature.
Dungeon Master 03:02:26 And so it is like this straight up portal to hell. Everything is on fire and kind of charred and burned and embered. But you walk this descending path.
Dungeon Master 03:02:36 And eventually, you get to what is known as the Cinder Cradle. It is this sort of space directly below the tree before it descends to the bottom that is completely encased in burning roots. And it is where the magic really sits for this tree and how it connects to the different realm.
Dungeon Master 03:03:00 You guys, in walking through the Cinder Cradle, have a chance to prep yourselves. You know there is a foe in there that you have to fight. So, like, it's not metagaming to be like, could I have done this? The answer is you would have known that you could. I'll show you the map that I designed, and then...
Dungeon Master 03:03:22 You guys, I'll drop whatever better one I can, best one I can. As you hit into this dark room, there's, like, this main route that comes down in the back corner, and you see that it's got, like, this bull shape in it. It looks like you just know that you're supposed to, like,
Dungeon Master 03:03:44 get in it and let the tree kind of consume you just get the sense that like you knew that when you hit this room you would know what to do and that's what you have to do um unf like furling and kind of breaking off of the roots on the wall is this um
Dungeon Master 03:04:03 horrendously um demonic charred looking tree creature it is mostly made of wood in its form but it's got this like perpetual flame burning out the back of it
Dungeon Master 03:04:20 It is carrying this huge like wrought iron cleaver in like axe. And when it opens its mouth and like turns to you, there is like this radiating furnace heat.
Dungeon Master 03:04:35 just like it's blowing hot air out of its mouth as soon as it opens, and then it closes it, and you see it constantly has a vent of that sort of heat escaping between its massive fangs, and it sort of turns to you like it was expecting, sets its feet, turns its weapons out, and lets out this horrendous sort of scratching of tree branches together, like that's its roaring, and it's very much just going to get right into the fight.
Dungeon Master 03:05:04 We'll hold off on initiative, but you guys are going to fight the cindered guardian of the death tree when we pick up next time. Just because. Instead, you just got like some little halfling foreskin right on your shoulder.
Kaladen Shash 03:05:12 Of course. Alright, let's go. It's gonna be good.
Leopold Magnus 03:05:13 Damn.
Zariel Torgan 03:05:14 That fire resistance cloak is looking pretty good now. It's all shriveled up in the heat. Get out of here. It's getting caught on my tusks.
Cyrus Schwert 03:05:30 Okay.
Dungeon Master 03:05:40 It's kind of like raised up a little bit. What do your tusks do? How big do you imagine your tusks are? Do you have like massive ones or like nubs? Really? We'll have to see some character art, you know. Hellboy, but they're tusks, not horns. You just have like...
Zariel Torgan 03:05:44 Yeah. Let's get out of here. Massive. I want big ones. Like Hellboy up. I'll probably have to keep him chopped. That way I can look around. Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 03:05:52 Overwhelm.
Leopold Magnus 03:06:06 Oh, God. That witch really did you. You might as well be a real boy.
Dungeon Master 03:06:11 I imagine Zariel talks with a more exaggerated southern accent and a list. So you texted me that you wanted...
Zariel Torgan 03:06:16 Yeah. Well, now, yeah. Definitely. Yep. I think I look great because I was a robot. I got a dick now. I just thought of it. I just thought it would be a big...
Kaladen Shash 03:06:28 No giant loss to you.
Cyrus Schwert 03:06:32 That's awesome.
Dungeon Master 03:06:37 to change your form? Is that something you've wanted for a little bit? Or is that something you just thought of?
Zariel Torgan 03:06:46 to give up and you know it'd be interesting I know that Zariel as a character you know always feels a little I don't know different because he's not real so this is something that he can have that also detracts from you know because my AC is lower too hmm yeah
Dungeon Master 03:07:12 It does lower. You lose that natural armor. You also need eight hours of sleep and can't breathe underwater, things like that. Like, everything becomes back to normal D&D. But now you are stronger. You can't die the first time you're supposed to. And, like, the extra damage on, like, melee attacks. So even...
Zariel Torgan 03:07:19 That's pretty sweet.
Kaladen Shash 03:07:20 You can't walk underwater on your own and you can't
Dungeon Master 03:07:41 in your wild shape forms when they take strikes with their hands. If you crit on that, you're doing extra damage dice. Love it. I think it was cool. Do you want to know all the things? It's an unmodified version of the reincarnate table. So if you rolled one through four, you got Dragonborn.
Leopold Magnus 03:07:50 Oh yeah.
Zariel Torgan 03:07:52 I like it. I think it was a good compromise. Sweet.
Dungeon Master 03:08:09 5 through 13 is Hill Dwarf. 14 through 21 is Mountain Dwarf. 22 to 25 is Dark Elf. 26 through 34 is High Elf. Then it goes Wood Elf, Forest Gnome, Rock Gnome, Half Elf, Half Orc, Lightfoot Halfling, Stout Halfling, Human Tiefling.
Zariel Torgan 03:08:35 Yeah, that kind of makes sense. Yeah, I was thinking that half elf. Oh, interesting. Interesting. Did we want to talk about our characters?
Cyrus Schwert 03:08:35 I mean, you got a pretty good one.
Dungeon Master 03:08:36 So way more rare at the top, extremes, and then more common, more numbers towards the middle. Human, not an option, weirdly enough.
Kaladen Shash 03:08:37 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:09:04 Yeah, you guys technically were shown your characters getting ready for a meeting, so it wouldn't be out of the question to talk about them, but you could also keep them secret for when they get revealed.
Zariel Torgan 03:09:17 What do you guys think? Do you want to talk about them, not tomorrow, but the next day or whatever day we play? All right. That works.
Kaladen Shash 03:09:25 You can do a reveal then. Yeah. Yeah. Um,
Cyrus Schwert 03:09:26 I kind of want to reveal them when we start playing them. So are we going to do the battle thing Saturday, like a quick encounter situation, and then play the full thing on Sunday? Or are you just going to do the whole thing? Because it's going to take three hours to do this encounter.
Leopold Magnus 03:09:30 That would be sick.
Dungeon Master 03:09:45 This will be a hard fight. So it's going to take a while. Or you guys could absolutely rock me if you do it. That just happens sometimes. Sometimes it's not balanced.
Dungeon Master 03:10:06 So we could do that. We could do something Saturday, play main thing Sunday, or we could just do main encounter Sunday, start off with a big fight, take the break, start up with the next characters, introduce all of that, and then just pick it up virtually after that. It doesn't matter.
Zariel Torgan 03:10:26 Yeah, well, that all sounds good to me. I'm good either way. Yeah. Sweet. Cool beans.
Leopold Magnus 03:10:29 I'm flexible, but yeah, I mean, it's going to be a big fight. Cool.
Dungeon Master 03:10:34 But what if we just save D&D for one day, and we can just do other games the day before? Cool. That'll be great. Less maps I have to make. It'll be perfect. Sweet, guys.
Cyrus Schwert 03:10:41 That's good. That was fun.
Kaladen Shash 03:10:41 They're important, right?
Zariel Torgan 03:11:00 Yeah, it was awesome, Jonathan.
Leopold Magnus 03:11:02 It's good setting the scene. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:11:02 That's a tough one for Trace to miss. The reason we delayed for two weeks in a row was because I was like, you kind of have to have everybody be here for this. It's really important. And then last minute stuff comes up and you can't help that. But it's a big one to miss.
Cyrus Schwert 03:11:13 Yeah.

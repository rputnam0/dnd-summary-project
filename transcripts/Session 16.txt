Dungeon Master 00:00:00 Okay. Let's chat for a second game plan. I'll be back in a moment.
Zariel Torgan 00:00:02 Haha, yeah. Sweet.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:06 Uh, so I just generated some pictures of Terrence. Some of these fucking pictures. Let me, uh, let me, uh. This one is just like outright fucking ridiculous.
Kaladen Shash 00:00:14 You dropping them in the Discord chat? That's close, man. If he went full furry, that's what it would absolutely look like.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:37 Yeah, yeah This one is like a cartoon Yeah, that's me it's summer yeah, yeah, that's my dnd, uh, I was a uh, were rat was cosplaying as a were rat Lark can't there you go
Zariel Torgan 00:00:42 So you're saying that's not a picture that you just had? Yeah, I was going to say. Oh, I thought it was LARP camp. That's so funny. That's fantastic. That's just awful.
Kaladen Shash 00:00:47 That's actually Rex's summer camp. That's him.
Zariel Torgan 00:01:14 Oh, God. That's like all the worst parts of both Monsters, Inc. characters. Oh, my gosh. Oh, that's awesome. That's great.
Kaladen Shash 00:01:19 That's perfect.
Leopold Magnus 00:01:22 The prompt was a dwarven nerdy furry kid who got bit by a were-rat and wears plastic vampire fangs. That's probably why I don't get as much out of the image generators as other people.
Kaladen Shash 00:01:48 She. This is not bad at all. Rex Rex put. Put the let go to the light splitter description or here. I'll put I'll share. Yeah, and just just dump that in there and see what it says here.
Zariel Torgan 00:01:50 I don't know, these are pretty great.
Leopold Magnus 00:01:55 What was that guy's name though? Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, put it in the chat and I'll put it in the video game, see what happens. Yeah, that's actually, I've gotten some pretty good results with like a describe this image prompt and then taking the description and putting it into the image ones.
Kaladen Shash 00:02:22 All right, there you go. And I dumped it into the game log. I just shared it in the game log. So you can highlight it right from there. Just those first two paragraphs describe the sword.
Leopold Magnus 00:02:37 Did you put it in the general chat? Oh, OK. Oh, yeah, yeah, I see. Oh, man, I can't copy and paste this. No, I can't highlight the text.
Kaladen Shash 00:02:55 Are you kidding? No, no.
Zariel Torgan 00:02:59 Oh, yeah. What's interesting is you can click on specific words that have to do with actions. Like you can click the 1D6 for rolling, but you can't. Isn't that kind of cool? I've been eating carrots. Can you guys hear me chomping? Is it like super loud? OK, cool. Just making sure.
Leopold Magnus 00:03:12 Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I haven't noticed it too bad. Yeah, I think the voice isolation on Discord is actually really good now.
Kaladen Shash 00:03:26 Now.
Zariel Torgan 00:03:39 I was noticing that, I just, uh, you know, I want to double check, make sure you guys aren't having to listen to me chomp. Also, I think what's hilarious is it was a DC 10 check to convince the shield that we had fought this thing before. And I already failed it immediately to start the battle. Very funny.
Leopold Magnus 00:03:47 No, it's not forward. I think you failed that.
Kaladen Shash 00:03:59 So it was. Hardshark Hardshark. Rex, I just put it in the Discord chat.
Zariel Torgan 00:04:10 I was that would have helped a good bit because I think it helps gives me like an additional plus one to my AC. And I think it does something else. I mean, I don't think I ever got the actual item. To know what it does specifically, but. Oh yeah, there it is.
Leopold Magnus 00:04:31 OK. OK.
Leopold Magnus 00:05:02 Let's see, we want it realistic. What kind of design do you want on it? Because there's categories. You can make an anime one. Okay, I'll do realistic. What kind of color palette are you thinking? There's all sorts of weird shit. Fresh, jungle, melons, kind of like high neon colors.
Kaladen Shash 00:05:06 Oh, yeah, like very. No, it's very realistic. I have no idea.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:34 Is this just for the AI image generation that you showed me? Oh, OK. I'll be kind of interested to see. Yeah, that was what I was noticing. Hyper-realistic isn't great for getting the kind of goofy fun.
Leopold Magnus 00:05:35 Yeah, there's like different things you can I don't know if you ever play around with that I I think that normally the for D&D stuff the cartoon or anime setting is pretty good
Kaladen Shash 00:05:38 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:06:00 Oh, I'm back. Oh, that's pretty close.
Leopold Magnus 00:06:04 Oh, some of these are really cool, Bryn. The problem is, is it's only like of the hilt. Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:06:10 But I bet it can spit out some good shots. This will be fun. Oh, that's rad. Look at that. That's close to what Jonathan had mentioned. It's. That's pretty good. Yeah. That's rad, that's fun.
Zariel Torgan 00:06:21 That's sweet. Yeah. Looks a lot more stained glass. That's cool. I think the thing I've noticed with that image generation for me that was the hardest
Leopold Magnus 00:06:33 Yeah, some of them are kind of funky. Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:06:42 was getting like the shot of the image that I want like for the one I made for my profile I said upper torso neck and head of this image and it was like from the chin down and so I'm like what like three out of the five options or whatever it was like almost all of them except like two were of like the chin down that's I don't know I just thought that was odd
Kaladen Shash 00:06:46 Yes.
Dungeon Master 00:06:54 That's funny. I tend to just say, like, create, yeah, I say create, like, character art or artwork for my D&D character, and then it does, like, a very specific portrait of it.
Leopold Magnus 00:07:05 Jesse, you just have to socially manipulate it. Yeah, if you just tell it you might be killed, it'll do a better job, too. Worry, Sam breath.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:14 Oh Oh
Kaladen Shash 00:07:19 I gave it the realm of D&D. Oh no, I was just looking at the pictures you uploaded.
Leopold Magnus 00:07:36 Yeah, I think that first one was the best, but I don't know, maybe you guys think the other ones are pretty cool too. Yeah, I think it's cooler, like more intact.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:46 I like the first one the most. The most intact.
Kaladen Shash 00:07:58 I'll feed this into Dolly again and see if it does something different.
Leopold Magnus 00:08:17 Yeah, I'm wondering if you just ask like chat GPT to describe that image so you can explain it to your blind friend what kind of like description it would give. And then you just put it back. Yeah. Uh huh.
Dungeon Master 00:08:19 And then you feed that into the image generator. Or you can even send it the image of the closest thing, like the thing I drew, and say, make a realistic storage version of this and see what it spits out.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:25 That's hilarious. Yeah, that's pretty cool.
Leopold Magnus 00:08:48 Oh yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:08:51 It's usually pretty good at, like, taking context from that. So what are the odiers doing?
Zariel Torgan 00:09:09 I think we're just beating feet back to get some silver. I say, I don't know about you guys. I say we don't tell anybody what happened. Yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:09:21 We just come back beat to shit.
Kaladen Shash 00:09:22 We just, we just, we just played off. Yeah, nobody looked too bad. Oh, yeah, they're full. Yeah, we just played off like, oh, we were going to take a rest before you do that. We have an idea where they're at.
Dungeon Master 00:09:24 You're a robot now. You guys already slept through the night.
Zariel Torgan 00:09:39 Spring cleaning, you know, buying some buying some furniture for the new digs. I don't know, I just I don't I don't want to tell everybody we failed. So maybe we just maybe we just sneak in.
Leopold Magnus 00:09:48 I had to tweak something in my toolbox. I'll be right back.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:12 But I'm cool with whatever. That's a good idea. Do a little bit of research.
Kaladen Shash 00:10:12 Yes.
Dungeon Master 00:10:13 Yes, honey.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:15 Yeah, I think that maybe we go back. I think we need to visit the library and study up on how to take down this were-creature. It's pretty clear that we couldn't do damage, so I think we need to at least read a book about silver or something. Yeah, and character, not necessarily. I feel like it would be a little bit of, yeah, we were so clearly, like, we so clearly missed that that I feel like we should at least read a book.
Kaladen Shash 00:10:46 Oh.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:48 When is reading a book ever solved anything? I think so, I think it's a good idea. We could check and see if my ring's done.
Dungeon Master 00:10:48 At one point, you guys got it to like half health. It just, it didn't focus fire, you know, a little scattered.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:53 Yeah. But yeah, I think in character, Leopold would be like, oh dear, I must insist that creature didn't take any big lumps. We better, we better study up.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:15 And maybe Hamhawk has something we could use to dissolve that necklace into some sort of powder that we could apply to a sword or, you know, that way, at least once around, everybody's getting something with silver in it. Oh. Yeah, I'm cool with that. Well, what do you guys think?
Leopold Magnus 00:11:30 Yeah, that's a great idea. Yeah, just need to take some time, maybe rest and grind some silver. Let's do it.
Dungeon Master 00:11:30 You guys have Jeweler's Kit in the workshop. You could grind it up. Awesome. I mean, I put you in this map
Kaladen Shash 00:11:45 I'll go with it.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:50 Jonathan, would Hamhawk be done with my ring by now, or is it going to take longer than that? It's only been a day.
Dungeon Master 00:11:59 really um it looks like it's daytime but if you guys remember you you had slept to the point of night went out at like 10 o'clock and had you know this fight which seemed like it took forever but in reality it's been like two hours two and a half hours so it's it's like midnight at this point
Zariel Torgan 00:12:25 Yeah, let's just go to sleep. Yeah, I'm cool. I'm cool with just sleeping it off if you guys are. Alright, so we level up. After getting spanked. That's fair.
Dungeon Master 00:12:25 And you know, yeah, I was going to say, you know you're supposed to pick it up the next day. Nope.
Kaladen Shash 00:12:39 Yes, leave it off. Of course. Nope. It's red.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:39 Yeah, let's do that. I just generated Selena's potion shop.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:56 Very fair. That's cool. Oh, that sword looks awesome, Bren.
Dungeon Master 00:13:03 Nice. This is my makeshift map for the sort of room that you guys found until I make some better.
Leopold Magnus 00:13:23 Sick. Right. Yeah, I think it's, uh, I don't know. I think it probably runs some dolly in the back end. I'm not really sure.
Kaladen Shash 00:13:27 Yes. I think I feel like whatever your generators more versatile though, because clearly you can like more easily like program what you're looking for.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:56 All right, so are we going to do anything before we take a long rest?
Leopold Magnus 00:14:05 Um, well, I guess it's midnight and I didn't even get a full full night, uh, before we left. So I think I'm probably going to just go right to bed. I'm I'm exhausted. I'm beat. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:14:13 at your current Excel video.
Kaladen Shash 00:14:18 Yeah, I just need to meditate. Are we going to do this in the toolbox, or are we trying to go all the way back to our place? Next.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:25 Oh, I didn't even think about the toolbox. Do you guys wanna just throw it behind a dumpster or something to hop in? I don't know, you got a key to Hamhawk's workshop?
Leopold Magnus 00:14:38 We could do that. Do you think we'd run the chance of getting discovered? Where are you thinking about putting it? I don't think I do. But that doesn't mean I couldn't get it. Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:53 I mean, we could just go back to our barracks. I mean, just keep it simple, you know? We gotta get back and kill that thing this session to redeem ourselves, so we gotta get cooking. Yeah, because I need eight hours, so you guys are gonna get stuck with an extra, like, four or two hours anyway.
Kaladen Shash 00:14:56 Okay. Back to the darks. Did someone spend some time to grind the silver?
Leopold Magnus 00:15:11 I figured I can do that after we wake up. Okay, yeah, I have a jewelry kit, I think, because I have every tool for the job.
Dungeon Master 00:15:16 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:15:22 What I'm saying, I can grind the silver. I just need four hours of meditating. I'll just be like a busy little bee.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:27 Okay. Yeah. Sweet. Well then, yeah, let's just get back to the barracks and I'll conk out to get started, because as soon as I'm done, we can go, because you guys are just going to be waiting on me. But, well, Jonathan.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:51 Um, that's a dumb question. I just did variant human because I didn't want to tip anything. Um, should I just, I should just stick with variant human stats, right? Like maybe I'm just like a weird robot that needs eight hours.
Dungeon Master 00:15:54 No dumb questions. Yeah. No, not really. If you want it to be like a Warforged, they have their own benefits.
Kaladen Shash 00:15:59 That's fun. No. No. You're a workhorse.
Leopold Magnus 00:16:18 Yeah, Warforged is like pretty OP.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:24 All right, well, I'm not gonna mess with it right now, because I don't wanna mess everybody's time up, but I didn't think about it till just now. So I'll do the eight hours, and I'll treat it like normal, but once we're done with this session, I'll spend some time and look at my options, and that way I familiarize myself with what I can do.
Dungeon Master 00:16:39 Okay, okay. You guys made your way back to the core wall. You got teleported. That weird stretching and then snapping back into place sensation as you make your way back to the core to the Omen Knight level into that large sort of circular octagonal room.
Kaladen Shash 00:16:44 Yep.
Dungeon Master 00:17:05 And finally into your guys's room, which is like the top corner on the left side. From there, you guys set up your workshop. So you could either sleep in your room or in the workshop itself, doesn't super matter. But rest finds you quickly as it was a pretty hard day all in all. No night terrors, lucid dreams, nothing like that. I think sleep finds you pretty hard and you guys all wake up at your respective times.
Dungeon Master 00:17:35 Calvin, you rise first. If it's like midnight when you go to sleep, so it's like, you know, four in the morning, even outside of the pocket workshop and into like the main room, you hear some scuffling around, maybe some people getting some really early morning training session in, but like very quiet still. And the rest of you. Mm hmm.
Kaladen Shash 00:17:44 Can I grind to the necklaces in that four hours?
Zariel Torgan 00:17:57 Sweet.
Dungeon Master 00:18:07 It'd take less than that, yeah. With a jeweler's kit, which you have, it would be pretty quickly just grind it up. So you can put it into a fine dust. I'm going to say, like, if you all got a necklace to start with. So you have those three necklaces. You used one to saw an aortic arch. I'm going to say that one was, like, stuck in the body. So you have two necklaces worth of silver dust.
Kaladen Shash 00:18:21 Three okay. Well,
Dungeon Master 00:18:37 Let's call it five applications for each necklace. You've got 10 uses of silvered weapon effect.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:50 Nice. Yeah, works for me.
Kaladen Shash 00:18:51 evenly divide that by 3, 3, and 3, or 4, 3, 3, and 4. I have absolutely none. Can you just have traded that? Can you just convert that down?
Leopold Magnus 00:19:02 Maybe I need to see a banker. Do any of you have some silver I could trade a piece of gold for? Yeah, how much gold or how much silver per gold piece? And gold?
Dungeon Master 00:19:18 Yeah, I mean, you can go ask somebody if they've got change for gold. 10. D&D money is like metric system, 10 for every one on each level. So one gold is an average person's wage a day, and then everything down from that, it's just increment.
Kaladen Shash 00:19:22 It's great.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:35 Oh, okay. That's good. I didn't know that. Well, I'll turn in five gold and silver.
Dungeon Master 00:19:55 Wait, 50 silver. No. That's what I tried to say last time. I was like, how many do you want to shoot? Because you get the sense that shooting one would have the effect, but you wanted the shotgun effect, so you shot like 10.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:57 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:58 So now I have 100 silver. Jonathan, for all intents and purposes, it seems like I'd need to shoot more than one silver piece to get a similar effect if I did like a cannonball.
Leopold Magnus 00:20:23 Right, yeah, well for Flare that was cooler, but I mean now that I think about it, we have 10 applications from those necklaces. Do you think it computes in the right way in terms of the fight? I'm all for it. OK, cool, just making sure.
Zariel Torgan 00:20:37 Um, and if you still want the flavor, you could say you like throw a coin in your mouth and like chew it into a bunch of little pieces and then shoot it, shoot it like a shotgun or something.
Dungeon Master 00:20:38 I would say that since casting catapult is a spell slot, one silver is perfectly fine. Yeah. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:20:54 Oh yeah, that's that's a good idea. Yeah. Yeah. Alright, so I'm going to take a long rest. Oh yeah, let me.
Kaladen Shash 00:20:57 Stop. Great.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:10 Yeah, I did that as well. Swapped out some spell slots and stuff.
Dungeon Master 00:21:27 What is next for that group?
Zariel Torgan 00:21:43 Um, I want to. Uh huh.
Leopold Magnus 00:21:47 Oh, fuck. I have this heroism spell, which prevents people from getting frightened. A willing creature you touch is imbued with bravery until the spell ends. Creature is immune to being frightened and gains temporary health. So would that basically snap me out of it? One minute. I mean, it is a concentration. Yeah. Can you do it on yourself?
Kaladen Shash 00:21:50 What? It's precious. I think it definitely would have if you could have cast it. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:22:01 What's the duration? The concentration? Yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:22:18 Okay, well, good to know. Yeah. And then you're immune to being frightened by the rest of the day, you said? Oh, shit.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:22 It also doesn't need to work for a whole minute. You just have to succeed once from the prep for presence. 24 hours. Which reminds me, did you ever succeed? Well, my thoughts were if
Kaladen Shash 00:22:28 Right? No.
Dungeon Master 00:22:33 Mm hmm. Right, well.
Leopold Magnus 00:22:41 I took it. I took a stress point to push past it. So I think maybe I should just for the sake of this cast heroism. Right.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:52 Kaladin and I go back there. We're still immune because it's still only been, you know, 10 hours or whatever. That's interesting. All right. Sweet. Well, I'm ready to rock and get back at it. I need to redeem ourselves. We've got the powder. We've got the coins. What can I do?
Leopold Magnus 00:23:18 Do we have any way to move the earth or how are we planning to get back?
Zariel Torgan 00:23:26 That's a good call. Let me see if I can... Let me take a second. I don't think druids can change their tantrums. I think those are set. Let me just check my spells real quick, see if I got something I could use.
Kaladen Shash 00:23:32 I can only change out one cantrip. I changed out one cantrip already. I don't know the rules there.
Dungeon Master 00:23:47 No, I'm pretty sure druids can change out your spells every day. You stalk them. Oh, maybe. I would check that.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:53 I think spells, yes. I thought cantrips, no. I thought cantrips were like set. Let me Google it real quick.
Kaladen Shash 00:24:02 It feels like you'd be able to change your hand feel. Wow. Good.
Dungeon Master 00:24:18 Silence.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:20 No, it says druids in 5e cannot change their cantrips, however they can change their prepared spells. Yeah, I remember that being an interesting tweak that was a benefit for wizards because their spells were so difficult to get, but they could swap out their cantrips. I remember that being... Anyway, so yeah, so no, I can't. But I'll look for regular spells to see if I got anything I could use.
Kaladen Shash 00:24:46 Crap.
Dungeon Master 00:24:52 Okay. Are you guys going to the library like you said, or are you going just now that you've got silver going back?
Leopold Magnus 00:24:59 I mean, I think for all intents and purposes, I would swing by the library to read up, but I think we kind of know what we need to do, right? Maybe I can make one check to peruse the monster section of the library. I'm assuming there's some repository of creatures, right?
Zariel Torgan 00:25:11 I think so, yeah. But you're going to be up a couple hours before me.
Kaladen Shash 00:25:24 Yeah, Jonathan, can I, can I in that four hours of also look at the touch screen for some sort of information on that? Cool. To roll anything? Cool.
Dungeon Master 00:25:34 Mm-hmm. Yeah. Both of you just give me like an investigation check.
Leopold Magnus 00:25:43 Um, and I guess what I was going to look for specifically is, um, obviously these minions were turned, like there's one big one, but like, is the source of this really big, the aware wisdom or whatever it is, the big guy, or is there something else, you know?
Dungeon Master 00:26:04 Mm-hmm. 18 and 13. Kaladin, I'll give you guys different things with your roles. So Kaladin, when you're checking in that four-hour span of time, you're doing it, and a lot of the general information is the same. So you're filtering through a lot of duplicates and the same stuff over and over again. But what you do find beyond the,
Dungeon Master 00:26:33 vulnerability to silver and the inability to patch silvered wounds. You see that it's not normal for werewolves to be able to always change, to be able to go back and forth in their shapes a lot of the time. Normally it's only from a full moon. And you happen to know that last night wasn't technically a full moon, so it was
Dungeon Master 00:27:03 odd. You think that there were so many in their full lycanthropic forms and as well you saw Terrence and the other individual change at will. So this is like not super straightforward but you can't like find anything that would suggest why necessarily. There's no like historical text to describe that. Leopold, in your studies
Kaladen Shash 00:27:15 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:27:28 You're going through just werewolves to start with, and then you sort of take a sidetrack on accident that happens to be beneficial. You're checking all these books really quickly, skimming through them at very quick pace. And you find just a book on like the wolf social structure. And you're reading about how the most powerful wolf tends to be the alphabet.
Dungeon Master 00:27:53 contrary to popular belief, there's not just like an alpha male wolf, there's always an alpha female wolf. And you're just like, reading about it. And you find it striking in that you had seen a very large werewolf on that market attack. And you saw that one in the cavern system. But when you're thinking back on it, you're like, they don't look identical, but they look similar enough that
Dungeon Master 00:28:23 you think you've seen both halves of the social hierarchy. And that's what you get in 18. You're putting that together as you're reading these things. You're like, holy shit, one of those wolves was female, one of those wolves was male. And they're definitely of the same sort of power source. They look too similar to be unrelated.
Leopold Magnus 00:28:35 So the one out... Okay, so they're different. Does it have any details in regards to, like, the source of the werewism? Like, if we take these guys out? Seems like they're the head honchos.
Dungeon Master 00:28:54 You read from general sources and you also remember from Leora in that it's not like vampires where if you take out the head vampire the rest are like freed of the curse. Lycanthropy is curable but it's once it spreads it's not dependent on the prior. There are like certain connections to the original infector and like the subsequent ones but
Leopold Magnus 00:29:07 Ah, OK. Got it. Well, I would share that with the team that there's likely more than one
Dungeon Master 00:29:23 It is not like take the head down, kill the whole snake.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:37 So we best tread carefully. Are we ready to head out then?
Kaladen Shash 00:29:43 Yes, let us return to the tunnels.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:57 Yeah, yeah, I'm ready to go. Oh, can I swing by and get that ring of protection?
Leopold Magnus 00:30:03 Oh, indeed. I'm feeling refreshed after a full night's rest.
Dungeon Master 00:30:13 Hey, you guys. You eat up, you get your dust. Do you want to divvy out the potions as you make your way out? Yeah, you can stop by a Ham Hocks and you have the coin for it. OK.
Kaladen Shash 00:30:24 Yeah. Jonathan, is it it's.
Zariel Torgan 00:30:37 Yeah, I paid up front.
Dungeon Master 00:30:43 Then yes. Anything else? No, that one needed a little more time than the brain. Do you have in mind what you want the armor to do?
Kaladen Shash 00:30:52 There hasn't been nearly enough time for the armor, right? That was just been overnight. Just checking. I don't ask, that's intuitive. Like, okay, wait. No, that's totally up to you. That's like, you know, dealer's choice or just whatever.
Dungeon Master 00:31:24 Okay, I'll think of something as we go through this session, maybe get it through by the end. You guys make your way to the teleportation room. I forget what we called the teleportation majors, like Ezekiel or some shit like that. But he teleports you to the correct side of the wall. You make your way through the storm district, and eventually you make your way
Kaladen Shash 00:31:30 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:31:52 into the cellar it is at this point early enough hours that the the tavern which you guys never even really looked at the name of you just kind of found your way back to there um it's not technically open so you have to speak with brock the bouncer who um you guys would succeed eventually or just kill them if not um kind of gain access to the building
Dungeon Master 00:32:21 Walk through to the back room into the cellar into the cavern system. You guys just be lining it for it. OK. It's switching the maps for you guys, right? It's switching maps when I switch it.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:28 Yeah, we'll do this thing. Yeah. I'm on like a big turd looking one. That's what turds look like, right?
Kaladen Shash 00:32:40 I haven't, I'm still, um. That's what I think I saw. Yep, that's, yep.
Dungeon Master 00:32:53 Lots of gray and red. Yeah, that's the top view of the cavern. We got some problems. As you guys make your way through the tunnel system, everybody give me just a general stealth check. And get out of that.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:00 Might need to see a doctor. Should I probably do pass without a trace? Or probably a little late now. I just rolled.
Kaladen Shash 00:33:18 Of course, of course. Yes, a lot. I mean, we got pseudo armor advantage, a plus 10 would be helpful.
Dungeon Master 00:33:30 No, you could have. This is sort of over a period of time. You guys, you recovered from your exhaustion points too.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:34 What do you guys think? Do you think it's worth it? Yeah, I'll do it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I got it. Add plus 10.
Leopold Magnus 00:33:43 I'm not stealthy at all. Ah, OK. Yeah, that was probably good. So that brings me up quite a bit.
Dungeon Master 00:34:03 22, 27, what Cal didn't get. Nice. Pretty good average. You guys make your way through. And are you guys sort of exploring a little bit, looking into all the side tunnels? Are you sort of retracing the main path that you know to be true?
Kaladen Shash 00:34:12 I would think just going slowly and tracing the main path.
Zariel Torgan 00:34:38 Yeah, I'd be afraid if we did too much exploring that we might burn more resources that would ultimately, you know.
Dungeon Master 00:34:38 Okay. Yeah. Easy enough. You guys are quiet enough that you don't attract any attention, but I would say oddly enough also, as you're sort of slowly one foot in front of the other, low to the ground, making your way through the tunnel system, the half pace makes it like an hour start to finish from like,
Kaladen Shash 00:34:45 Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:35:08 the cavern system start at the cellar all the way through, but eventually you make your way to the portion of the tunnel that you had collapsed. Not seeing a single way creature.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:21 All right. I don't have any thing that could help, unfortunately. I looked and I can't find any.
Kaladen Shash 00:35:41 Isn't there like an equation for dirt moving? Like a five by five cube in a half hour or something? How much debris is there? Is it wishful thinking guys that this is going to be
Zariel Torgan 00:35:56 Yeah. Yeah, that's a good point. They might not be waiting for us.
Leopold Magnus 00:35:56 What are you looking for, Jesse?
Dungeon Master 00:35:58 You guys have done quite a bit.
Kaladen Shash 00:36:08 But there will still be anywhere creatures waiting for us there. We won't know.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:26 Jonathan, you said we dropped a lot of dirt. Is that what you're saying? Well, why don't we? Well, hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:36:31 Not like an insane amount, but you guys dropped enough that you were sure that you wouldn't be immediately followed by like a mass of strong creatures. There's probably another way into that big room, but you'd have to risk going to a side tunnel if you didn't want to move dirt, but you could move dirt for sure.
Kaladen Shash 00:36:41 Can we start moving it?
Zariel Torgan 00:36:56 Can I survey the ground? I would imagine that if there was a way to get around, that originally when we were escaping, they would have gone around. And so one of these side tunnels on our side of this dirt is going to have a bunch of extra traffic all of a sudden. Could I look around and see if I recognize, would that be survival or perception or? OK. Give that a shot.
Dungeon Master 00:37:16 Mm-hmm. I like that. That'd be almost terrible. 14. 14 is enough that with some time, you sacrifice another 10, 15 minutes really looking. Eventually, you do see another, like one of the paths
Kaladen Shash 00:37:20 well.
Zariel Torgan 00:37:26 Um, uh, 14.
Dungeon Master 00:37:45 it's like not the immediate one to your left or right but you go a couple back and you see like a lot of displaced dirt at sort of into the main path as if like the the lichen creatures had tumbled out of the side tunnel at a pretty good pace that like they had to sort of dig in to make the corner so you're in your head you're like that makes sense is like uh they were they had enough of a direct line they could pick up speed like
Zariel Torgan 00:38:01 Gotcha. I'll quietly just indicate that to the group and let somebody a little more with darkvision through. Although I guess technically I have darkvision now. I guess technically I always had darkvision.
Kaladen Shash 00:38:25 Sweet.
Dungeon Master 00:38:32 Makes your brain hurt. Oh.
Zariel Torgan 00:38:34 Yeah. It's like a, it's like a psychological barrier, you know, like in Talladega nights where he's like, my legs don't work. Yeah. Um, yeah, I think I'll, I don't know. What do you guys think? Just head down this other tunnel and try to get into that main area.
Leopold Magnus 00:38:39 You know? Yeah, he could never learn to play the guitar. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:38:58 Let us move forward, yes. 14 and 16, that's not bad, good averages there.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:02 All right, sweet. Yeah, I'll start heading down that way. Do I hear anything coming from that direction? That's a natural 20.
Dungeon Master 00:39:08 Everybody go and give me a perception check. Natural 20. 16. So on average, all of you, as you're making your way through, you don't hear really a ton of sound. You definitely don't hear the sounds that you had heard when you had been sort of found.
Dungeon Master 00:39:35 of prior, but with the Natural 20s Arial, your hearing is super sensitive now that you realize you're not as limited as you thought. And you get this tinnitus type ringing before eventually your sort of inner mechanisms adjust and shift and the ring sort of turns very slightly and it changes frequency and speed and it self-corrects and you can hear
Zariel Torgan 00:39:40 Mhm.
Dungeon Master 00:40:00 a pretty far down one of the side tunnels of this tunnel you're in if you took like a left instead of a right there's a lot of what you hear is like heavy breaths and and like chest falls rising up and down like a lot of sleeping uh creatures beings people
Zariel Torgan 00:40:23 I'll use the telekinetic bond to just lay that out and just describe what I sense is up ahead. And maybe we can game plan. Do we want to just rush in? I feel like if we do, it's going to be kind of the same deal as before. If this thing wanted to just merc us, they would all ganged up on us. But clearly there was some sort of thing to prove.
Dungeon Master 00:40:34 Silence.
Kaladen Shash 00:40:45 Well, well, here's right. The problem is the silver will prevent them from healing. If we've got to fight, you know, three, four, five, you know, smaller ones again, just get to the big one. We're going to be,
Leopold Magnus 00:40:46 Now we're underground in a tunnel system, right?
Dungeon Master 00:41:12 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:12 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:13 Can we just like seal them in there and gas them out?
Kaladen Shash 00:41:17 Hey. Jonathan, just for like clarification and flavor question. Is it unreasonable for who do you pulled to essentially like? Either crack a coin around a pebble or a rock and still cast. Magic stones, whatever that. That is. Would that still count as a silver weapon?
Leopold Magnus 00:41:47 That's a good point.
Dungeon Master 00:41:53 Um. Right, I would say. Like the effort that went into creating silver dust. Of. The necklaces and all that gave 10 applications.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:53 Well, couldn't you also just take some of the powder? Like, the whole point of making the powder was you could use a single-use application. You could take one of your magic stones. Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 00:42:02 We only have 10. 10 is a killing blow, but 10 also prevents them from healing.
Dungeon Master 00:42:23 And Leopold just being able to crush a coin around a stone gives him, um, you know, 50 free castings worth of the same thing. It's just really overpowered by proportion. So I'm going to say he can't just brush coins around stones to make it look like that. He does have silver coins that can be ground down. If you guys wanted to take like another breather and do extra,
Kaladen Shash 00:42:44 Fair enough. I think we should. Let's. I think that's a really wise choice. We should at least double what we've got.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:45 Okay. Yeah. We feel pretty, pretty quiet. And even if they stumbled across our box,
Leopold Magnus 00:42:48 Yeah, I think we should probably spend at least a little bit of time to make some more silver powder.
Dungeon Master 00:42:54 Like he does have sleep, but I'm not going to give him like an instant access to it.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:12 I say we just hop in the workshop and just crank out another 10 applications or something. I mean, there's no reason to not have extra.
Kaladen Shash 00:43:21 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:43:21 No, I totally agree there. Now, I think, is there a way we can do that, like, scene in Glorious Bastards where they just, like, flamethrower all the Nazis? You know, like, trap them and just, like, rain hell down on them? Yeah, that's a good point.
Dungeon Master 00:43:35 Silence.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:41 I don't know, I feel like we could, but I think the problem is that the only way we're going to get to the big one is past the little ones. If we cover up the area and do damage, yeah, we'll probably kill a bunch of them, but we're not going to get the main one.
Leopold Magnus 00:44:00 All right, how long should we wait for making the powder? I guess, Jonathan, how long does that take? I guess, what's the exchange rate?
Dungeon Master 00:44:07 How much do you want to make? I said Bren had done the necklaces in like over the span of four hours, but I would say it didn't take very long. If you guys wanted to make like, I don't know, we'll say a half hour for every 10 applications.
Kaladen Shash 00:44:08 Once.
Zariel Torgan 00:44:31 Yeah, if we're all together working in the workshop, you know, working on the grinder or whatever it is. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.
Leopold Magnus 00:44:31 Okay. And how many coins, how many silver to the one application of dust? Okay. So we have how many? 10? Yeah, 10 each seems about right. Yeah. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:44:40 Yeah, we have 10 right now. Let's just make 20 more. That's 10 each. That's just one hour. Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:44:42 We'll say a coin per application. Just one coin, that's enough dust that you can do some damage with it. Okay, I like it.
Leopold Magnus 00:45:02 So I'm going to subtract 20 silver.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:07 And Jonathan, are we going to say are we going to say is that a bonus action? Is that like part of the action of the attack? So coding.
Dungeon Master 00:45:15 It'll be, we'll call it a bonus action. And we can even say, because it costs a bonus action, for those who have like multiple melee attack capability, you know, multiple strikes, swipes, claws, things like that, you still burn an application per attack, but it's still just one bonus action to cover your action economy, if that makes sense.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:42 Yeah, perfect yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:45:44 So, would that be, like, how would I do that on the stones? Would I have to use a bonus action to pull the stones up, then a bonus action to cover them in silver? Okay. And could I cover my stones as well as my attack in that same round? I use my bonus attack or bonus action for that? Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:45:53 Yeah, another bonus action to cover them. And then you've got three applications preloaded. Yep, it would cover your full action economy worth of stuff.
Leopold Magnus 00:46:16 Got it.
Dungeon Master 00:46:23 Okay, so you guys have the very slight and subtle sleeping sounds up to the left path, quite some distance, but you see you're still following the correct way. This map that I put you on is just to pass the image, not necessarily true to it. You know that if you go right to eventually you would head back to what you believe is the location you want to.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:52 So what do you guys say? You want to just keep sneaking in?
Kaladen Shash 00:46:55 Yes, let us move forward. Did you already make three stones then, Theo? OK, that's cool.
Leopold Magnus 00:46:57 Can we, how long is that silver powder last? Okay. Can I use one application to coat my, you know, sword and steel defender sword right now? Before we get into combat? No, that only lasts for one minute. So I can't, I can't prepare that unless we're just going to roll right in and like expect combat.
Dungeon Master 00:47:01 Forever. It's just metallic dust. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:47:25 I don't know. I didn't know. I didn't know if that was like how long I held the screen.
Leopold Magnus 00:47:28 Yeah. Maybe I just said a little vial of powder right where the laser will come out of my sword.
Dungeon Master 00:47:36 OK. You guys heading back to the main room then? Eventually, you guys find your way.
Zariel Torgan 00:47:55 Yeah, let's get in there.
Dungeon Master 00:48:02 back into this sort of den room, except this time you guys come out of a side tunnel over here. Room is mostly empty. Those of you with dark vision, which I believe is all of you now, as you're like peering over the 60 foot drop, you see that like in some corners there are some wolves sort of huddled up
Dungeon Master 00:48:32 laying about, strung out, sort of sleeping off the daylight hours, but like maybe a total of 10. And also you see some of them are into like a human form, humanoid, some like gnomes, halflings, humans, elves, people of all different sort of walks and heritages, just deep in a slumber.
Dungeon Master 00:48:58 you see occasionally one, like in a wolf form, gets up and sort of smacks his lips, looking around a little bit, maybe thought it heard something, and then kind of settles back down into a motionless state. You do hear, from the same spot that you had sort of heard before, at this sort of far edge, there is like an outlet
Dungeon Master 00:49:22 like another dark cavern or space that I just didn't put on there, which the larger creature had come from originally.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:38 Do we see? So the gray around the edge, that's the actual walkable space, right? From where it collapsed in the center.
Dungeon Master 00:49:53 Yeah there I think any sort of brown red line to mark like wall space like it outlines the actual perimeter of the whole thing so like the in-cut gray is the walkable path that's elevated the broken stone in the middle is where that walkway was and the shadowing to indicate uh like wall height so where it would drop off
Kaladen Shash 00:50:14 Yes. Yeah. OK, cool, cool, cool. Is that?
Zariel Torgan 00:50:20 OK. And we don't see the big creature anywhere? You guys think you want to try to sneak over there?
Dungeon Master 00:50:24 No, but you hadn't seen it until it had like walked forward. So you imagine that that space behind it or the space that you hear the large noises is like a larger room back there, maybe just for it or something like that. It's.
Kaladen Shash 00:50:42 We can sneak over there. We can try to peek in. Do we have to go down into the pit to get to the tunnel on the rear? OK.
Dungeon Master 00:50:55 This is where you guys were before. That was how you had gotten originally. On the right side is where the other creature had been and it was elevated off the ground quite a bit. So there's no direct path to that spot over there. Let me just draw another.
Kaladen Shash 00:51:15 Yes, let us move forward, we can try to get up there. I'm gonna stay not too close to the walls, just in case. Do we need to...
Leopold Magnus 00:51:22 I agree. Let's proceed.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:32 Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:51:44 make any sort of still checks per round or is it like just rolling looking? I see that. Perfect.
Dungeon Master 00:51:49 I'm going to need some active self checks for sure. I'm just drawing in a black shape. Yeah, so go ahead and give me just. Will do a self check. Guys, I you would still have. Pass without just because it asked for an hour, correct? Perfect.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:07 That's not a trace, right? Holy shit. 46.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:10 Yeah, I just double checked that. So yes, you still have it. I want to make sure before I said that. Alright, so 2920. Cheese. No, I think that's added in already.
Kaladen Shash 00:52:32 Interesting. No, no, no. That was the total. That was the total, straight up. It was a natural 19. The plus 10 was a big bump, and I already have some proficiency in that, so.
Dungeon Master 00:52:37 30, 60, 30. Good average. You guys, silently, we'll just roll. I'll just do three D20 rolls. And if one of them's a nat 20, it'd be the only way they could really hear you.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:40 Oh, okay, okay, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:41 Still very impressive. Yeah. That's pretty fantastic.
Dungeon Master 00:53:12 It's rolling to myself, but everybody it was a 15 and then an eight and then last one. Is another eight almost the 20 you guys go unheard. Towards the end of the elevated walkway.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:32 Do we need to make like a climb check or something or just to like.
Kaladen Shash 00:53:36 You know, I, yeah, what kind of, the gap's 20 feet.
Dungeon Master 00:53:46 Yeah, 20 feet. I would say, even though you just made it, I would need another stealth check to be quiet while climbing without making active skid sounds and dislodging debris off the wall. But if you just wanted to jump it all at once, it'd be different DCs for how you wanted to approach it.
Kaladen Shash 00:54:11 We can, let's go. I think everybody can climb. Thanks.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:14 I think I'd be better off climbing, because I'm not that dexterous. Versus, like, jumping, you know? Yeah, I'm going to roll another. So that's another 27. Not great. Not great. So that's a natural one.
Leopold Magnus 00:54:14 I mean, yeah. That plus 10 is huge, so. 13. Why am I so loud?
Dungeon Master 00:54:33 I know.
Leopold Magnus 00:54:42 Yeah, because they have disadvantage as well. No, I'm not seeing it. Oh, there it comes. Yeah, I'm going to fall down in that fucking werewolf pit again. Oh, jeez. Yeah, you're right there with me.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:44 Rough. Oh, now it's trying. We should have jumped.
Kaladen Shash 00:54:46 Where's my, why isn't that, oh my shoot. Did you guys skip the roll? Did that come through? That is 20, the 10 wasn't added to that yet. 30, 20, 30, 20.
Dungeon Master 00:55:08 It's going smooth-ish. You're, like, Kaladin, you're kind of crushing some stone underneath your boot as you're, like, making your way through. Zariel has pretty good luck. You make it, like, right to the edge, so you are sort of, like, right to here. Kaladin is, like, partway. He has to go slower. He keeps, like, you hear, like, crunching of gravel. He's not quite as elegant, weirdly enough, despite his form versus yours.
Dungeon Master 00:55:36 Leopold being the heaviest and the largest of the group by far, he's still trying his best. He has to take like half as many sort of side steps to cover the same distance. But with his last step, he just puts it on a wrong, wrongly placed stone. It crunches into it, the whole thing dislodges, and I'm going to give you one chance to stop it from making noise as this rock heads to the ground.
Dungeon Master 00:56:02 Do you want to like in a moment try to do something really quick?
Leopold Magnus 00:56:07 Uh, let me, yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea. Yes, I will cast, uh, I'll cast magic stone, um, and use that one as a stone. Uh, so I just touch the pebble. Can I reach out, touch it? Or is it out of my reach?
Zariel Torgan 00:56:10 Make it one of your magic stones.
Dungeon Master 00:56:33 Give me just a sleight of hand check. You can't touch him. Nice. Instantaneously, you almost go to do it with your gauntlet at first, and then quick thinking, you kick your foot out and you kick it.
Zariel Torgan 00:56:40 Guidance. Oh, nice. Damn. Oh, it's touch. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:56:40 Oh, yeah, not only.
Kaladen Shash 00:56:43 Matt, Matt 20, Matt 20. He cut it.
Dungeon Master 00:57:01 It's like physically kick it outward into space, but cast the magic through the kick at first so that it goes like 10 feet and then it comes to a slow halt as it's like locked into a little gravitational field that sort of draws it back to orbit around your head slowly but silently. And we'll call that Nat 20 offsetting that Nat 1 even. As Zariel, you being in the lead,
Leopold Magnus 00:57:25 Nice.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:26 Heh heh heh.
Dungeon Master 00:57:30 You make it to the opening of the space, and you sort of up on from your hands, you get your chin up, press onto your chest, lean forward, silently making your way in. You sort of roll up onto your knee, and you see sleeping in the sort of back end of the room, this large, again,
Dungeon Master 00:57:59 lycanthropic form of this huge bull. But while sleeping seems to be like next to slash on top of what appear to be three to four small like pubs, small pups.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:19 What do you guys think about, um... Trying to, like, collapse the entrance of this little quasi-cave? To guarantee... That, like... Yeah. I mean, eventually we're gonna have to, like, fight it out, but...
Kaladen Shash 00:58:36 that nobody can come join us? I think that's fine. I think we're just announcing ourselves for sure.
Leopold Magnus 00:58:47 Yeah, maybe we can. Yeah, I was just saying that we could, yeah, essentially what you're describing, get into position and then trigger a collapse and launch an attack all kind of in one swoop.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:48 I think we'd have to, like, hold our action, but what were you gonna say? Yeah, like two of us could, uh, two of us could...
Zariel Torgan 00:59:09 hold an action to attack, and then one of us could focus. I wonder if I have something that I could use to collapse that. Last time I collapsed by turning into a giant snake, which I could do again. What does Earth Tremors say?
Dungeon Master 00:59:23 Oh.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:24 I have earth trimmer, if that would potentially work. I know it's more, it says you cause a trimmer in the ground within range. If the ground is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared with a five foot diameter portion. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:41 Is it a first level spell? I don't know. Yeah, I have Thunderwave too.
Dungeon Master 00:59:54 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:54 So that's about all I can do. Or maybe a thunder wave or something. Because that's a pretty large blast, isn't it? Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:00:02 Well, it's actually not a bad, it's not a bad idea. 15 foot cube, 15 foot cube. You got.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:13 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I've also got Thunderwave.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:18 Oh, yeah, it says in addition, unsecured objects are entirely within the cube or pushed 10 feet away from you. So thunderous audible boom. Yeah, I mean, that seems like it could be a
Kaladen Shash 01:00:32 a greeting card and a means to close the tunnel.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:37 Yeah, Jonathan, does it seem, based on how we would recognize the level of impact we would know that spell to have, does it seem like, could I make a check to see whether or not the earth in this little tunnel seems like it would be volatile enough to come crumbling down if I did that?
Dungeon Master 01:00:50 I mean, the logic is pretty sound. I would say the only thing is there is, you know, I believe shatters a second level spell that does essentially what you're trying to make it do. So if two of you were to cast it at the same time, you could sort of make up
Zariel Torgan 01:01:14 Mm-hmm. Gotcha. Well, what do you say? Oh, go ahead. What were you going to say?
Dungeon Master 01:01:19 And sort of, if you hit one side of each of the cavern entrance, you could collapse it, but it would have to be from two different sources and not just one.
Leopold Magnus 01:01:29 Jonathan, I was going to say, what if I did an investigation check on the wall to see if there was potentially like a soft spot or a section that would be more vulnerable that could cause the effect if one of us did it? OK.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:50 I can... I think, I think it's very wise, like limiting more false is important.
Dungeon Master 01:01:50 I'm going to say I would just take care of you.
Zariel Torgan 01:01:51 Yeah, he wants to. I'm cool with that if you guys are. I don't know. I'm pitching this whole collapsing the tunnel thing, but we don't have to do that. All right, well, I'll post up here on this side, down here.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:16 And then let me see if I want to do anything as a bonus action. No, I don't have anything as a bonus action. Oh, oh, real quick. It's kind of late. Can I try to retcon something, Jonathan? Maybe.
Dungeon Master 01:02:23 All right, Tom.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:47 I want to try to convince the shield that I have, in fact, fought this creature before. All right, I want to say, yeah, well, you know, you were here. You saw it. We did this yesterday. It didn't go well. Maybe if you would have believed me, it would have.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:51 Yes, yes. Whisper a beautiful story to it. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:56 That's funny.
Dungeon Master 01:02:57 Yeah, you can get my. Would you say? Yeah, persuaded.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:16 Yeah, is that is that persuasion or? Yeah, I'm just trying to. I'm trying to talk it some sense into it. 17 minus 116. Oh damn, I thought it was a DC 10 if it was true and 15 if it was a lie.
Dungeon Master 01:03:30 I believe it was a DC 15, so that's passes. Or it might be 15, if it's a lot. You got it.
Kaladen Shash 01:03:33 you.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:43 Oh, okay, okay. Now that's just an additional plus one to AC. Right? Is that what that does? Or does it do something different? Okay. Awesome. Okay, perfect. All right.
Dungeon Master 01:03:57 Nope, just the plus one. So plus one on top of it being plus one shield currently acting as like a plus two overall on top of normal shield stuff.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:10 And then I'm good. So I'm ready to rock. Kaladin, do you know what you want to do? You know what you want to hold? Alright, sounds like we got a plan.
Kaladen Shash 01:04:22 Yes, who else is casting Thunderwave? Okay, then I will just wait. Locking loaded.
Leopold Magnus 01:04:25 Well, I'm happy to do it. I can position myself over here. And then I guess with my bonus action, can I dust the stones that I animated with some silver powder? Cool.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:47 Mmm, smart. Get him done now. Nice. Alright. I'm thinking I'll just wait until I see Kaladin wear up his hands like he's gonna shoot something. Or Leo, whichever. Whichever starts moving. Alright, well then yeah, I'll wait for Leo and then I'll blast off my Thunderwave as well.
Dungeon Master 01:04:47 Yes, you can.
Kaladen Shash 01:05:08 It's going to be Leo, I think, shooting.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:15 Yep. So I'll hand up, I'll hold up my hand and I'll do a kind of a one, two, three, and then.
Zariel Torgan 01:05:23 Well, hopefully it rolls really bad.
Dungeon Master 01:05:27 Nice. Since you guys are going to have to jump on it, go ahead and roll. We'll just roll initiative and I'll have it roll initiative with disadvantage. As it would be like startled into combat and it wouldn't be on the ball.
Kaladen Shash 01:05:52 We all did pretty good. Right.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:57 Yeah, disadvantage.
Zariel Torgan 01:05:57 Oh, Leo's got 13. Maybe he'll get a 2. That's all right, Callan, you still get to act. It's not bad.
Dungeon Master 01:06:08 It got with disadvantage a nine. Okay, what are, let me check the initiatives real quick, 13, six, five. Because it looks like he don't want it.
Zariel Torgan 01:06:35 What?
Kaladen Shash 01:06:35 I want it.
Dungeon Master 01:06:40 Okay, so aerial to five, calendar with the six. Add that backwards. Okay, up first. So you get the jump on it. As you let off this simultaneous thunder wave, it absolutely blows out the side of this entrance of this little side room. It collapses, you see.
Dungeon Master 01:07:06 this large lupine form startles up up into the back of the wall sort of reared up and you see the four small pups scared shoot for the sides of the room. Leopold, you have first action. Oh, yes. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:07:20 Yep. Yeah, I was gonna say, can I have cash to the firewall? Give it a first attack with some disadvantage, not with the three. Well, it doesn't hit. It was louder than I thought. I got scared.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:23 Did Kaladin get to do something? Don't you, don't you have advantage on, because it's unconscious, like even though you, I guess it would be not disadvantage, right?
Leopold Magnus 01:07:36 Damn.
Dungeon Master 01:07:38 So it just goes high.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:53 Or does that not work? Yeah, it's prone. So prone would be disadvantaged, but it's unconscious. Oh. Oh, I thought, OK. OK, never mind. Never mind. All right.
Kaladen Shash 01:07:56 Alex is laying prone. I'm I'm I'm conscious of only this melee only, I think. Yeah. Doesn't matter 55 is a disadvantage. Can't get there.
Dungeon Master 01:08:15 I'm labeled. You have another turn. Yeah. I didn't think you guys were going to.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:18 Yeah, so just launching off the Thunder Wave, I kind of, my ears ringing. That was my action, so I will have, I used my bonus action to, oh, I have a full another turn. Oh, excellent, okay. Yeah, so for, are we on another map? I guess, where is this creature?
Kaladen Shash 01:08:34 Yep. I was gonna get drawn out. Let's go. Kill him.
Dungeon Master 01:08:46 attack it in this side room. So I'm just going to make it real quick. So you're in a room like that.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:46 Oh, look at that guy.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:53 And here I was thinking maybe we shouldn't kill its pups. That thing's pretty evil, man. We should Van Helsing this guy.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:13 Uh, yeah, I'm gonna, uh, where I stand kind of kneeling after the ringing blast from two thunder waves, I will call forth my steel defender. I don't think I have a token for. Um, let's see, I've got, I've got 30 feet of movement, so.
Dungeon Master 01:09:23 I definitely have it. Oh, I had it on another map.
Zariel Torgan 01:09:27 Mark.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:42 Yeah, I will move to right about here and kick out the defender. Oh, sorry. Yeah, and then I'm gonna send it forward to the werewolf. Right about there.
Dungeon Master 01:09:53 You're going to have to give me time to find it. That was on a previous map I got. But you kick it out. Now you're good. Perfect. That's the action. Go for it. Roll to hit.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:11 I am commanding him to attack and then that's my action, my bonus action. I will use one of my magic stones. Where the fuck is it? There it is. Okay, 15 to hit. Yeah, that's okay. That's my action.
Dungeon Master 01:10:35 15 misses. OK. Hold on. Just do. OK. Did you steal the fender? It goes on the same turn, right? OK. Go ahead and have it go while I create.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:41 and bonus action. Yeah, it goes right after me. So he will do. Okay, yeah, it does a force empowered rend. Plus eight to hit.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:13 Uh, that would be 22 to hit. Cool. Um, and that's a 1d8 plus three of force. Uh, seven damage on the swing and it is silvered.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:17 Yeah. Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:11:17 A 22 hit. Nice. OK. Seven damage.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:40 And that's it actually.
Dungeon Master 01:11:46 Very nice. Okay, at the end of your turn will be this woven creature. It will frantically look left and right, see that there are people in like a sort of very private space. Let's see, you are... Let's say the scale is wrong and the room should be smaller, like 20 feet should be the biggest the space is.
Kaladen Shash 01:11:58 much.
Dungeon Master 01:12:12 Let me remap that real quick. But it'll charge at... I mean, I guess the Steel Defender's gonna lift some damage. Make that a huge space instead.
Kaladen Shash 01:12:37 Were any of those attacks silver attacks? Pretty cool. Oof, Yahtzee. That'd be a brawl. That'd be a little pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
Leopold Magnus 01:12:41 Yes, the Defender, yep. Yeah. I was gonna say tiny ass, yeah, just come in here while I was sleeping and start fucking it up.
Dungeon Master 01:12:42 The Steel Defender hit it with Silver. Maybe I'll make the room a little bit... I'll make the room a little bit bigger. But let me... Let me... Let me get some attacks off first. It'll do the bite because it has that just as its strongest attack off. Just right on the Steel Defender. Let's...
Zariel Torgan 01:12:45 Nice. Damn. Tight space.
Dungeon Master 01:13:13 That is a 21 to hit the steel defender. What is this? Is the steel defender immune to anything? Okay, go ahead and give me a constitution save for it as well.
Leopold Magnus 01:13:23 Yeah, that hits. It's immune to Charmed, Exhaustion, and Poisoned. Okay, Kaunas plus five.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:39 and all damage. Damn. Thanks, Brawny. Oof. Oof.
Leopold Magnus 01:13:56 Is that going to work? 18? 20 points. That's a big hit.
Kaladen Shash 01:14:00 That's how bad. Um? I'm going to cast chromatic orb.
Dungeon Master 01:14:01 18 exactly meets it, so it takes 11 points of necrotic damage instead. So 9 and 11, 20 points total. And then it'll be Kaladin.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:09 Damn. Yeah absolutely.
Kaladen Shash 01:14:30 First level. That's a 19 to hit. This will be fired.
Leopold Magnus 01:14:34 I don't know how to adjust his hit points, but it has seven. 27, so 27 has seven. Oh, yeah, for the defender, it's 15.
Dungeon Master 01:14:40 How many does it have to start with normally? And what did they see? 19 hits. What's the steel defenders? Perfect. 15 acid damage.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:52 Nice. Ooh, acid. Hmm, gotcha.
Kaladen Shash 01:15:05 No, it's sorry not. I said that's that should be fire damage. I think it auto picks the. The damage type when you use the roller. I don't know how to change that.
Dungeon Master 01:15:10 Cooking fire. OK. Very nice.
Dungeon Master 01:15:30 hitting both of the things at once, giving the disadvantage plus the non-regeneration. After your turn, it'll use a Legendary Action to take a swipe at the Stealth Defender because it's right there, but he'll do so with disadvantage.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:46 Row. And closed up. Mm.
Dungeon Master 01:15:58 It's not letting me interact with it anymore. That's OK. That is 21 and 16. So 16 to hit at the lowest. And that's, I believe, 2D8 on just the claw.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:15 Yeah, 16 minutes. Damn. Yeah, yeah, it's dead.
Dungeon Master 01:16:26 But I do need another deck on save. 11 points of Necrotic Damage.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:34 You're gonna have a ware defender. Oh, shit.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:42 Yeah, that blasts it into gears and pieces and components of armor.
Dungeon Master 01:16:51 obliterates it just swipes it into the wall to the side getting out of the way and you see it moves up not technically moving but it moves towards you in this next turn just going towards the next closest as you are and I don't have them on the map we'll say there's at least one or two pups sort of right up against the wall so you're the closest as like a threat right now and after that it is Zario.
Zariel Torgan 01:17:15 All right, as a group, do we want to see a lot of little things or like some fire? What would you guys prefer? I was like, I got a spell I can do. And so I don't know what would be cooler. All right, I'm going to dig my hand into the ground
Leopold Magnus 01:17:27 I guess I'm not really tracking you. Yeah, just do what you feel is right.
Kaladen Shash 01:17:32 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:17:44 and ripping it out, I'm gonna cast Summon Beast, and I'm gonna summon eight wolves. Yeah, there's regular wolves. I got the stat block for it. I want them to just all appear up out of the ground, burrowing out, and surround this big wolf.
Dungeon Master 01:17:58 the normal size.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:12 just like octagonally symmetrical. And then, let's see.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:17 Well, normally I wouldn't condone a wolf-on-wolf violence, but go get him, Zariel. That's so many.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:45 Oh, it's Conjure Animals, not Summon Beast. Okay, that's why I couldn't find it. There we go. All right. I think my least favorite parts of spells like this is that it lists the GM has the creature stats. Isn't that just so annoying? Like, they just assume... Yeah, they assume. They assume. It's all right, you don't have to have anything prepared or anything like that. I'm gonna have them all attack.
Kaladen Shash 01:18:45 Oh, they'll let you know what they are. Don't you worry.
Dungeon Master 01:19:12 Do they go on your turn? Okay, go ahead and roll an initiative for them now. What's their DEX bonus?
Zariel Torgan 01:19:14 Let's see, it says that they are friendly to me. It says that I'm supposed to roll initiative and that they'll go as a group. And so, okay, I'll just roll a straight D20. Hang on. Plus two, so I'll roll a D20, add two.
Kaladen Shash 01:19:30 So is that, Jesse, is that eight bite attacks? Nailed it.
Dungeon Master 01:19:42 So D20 plus two, yeah. Seven, okay. Yeah, because you're initiative five, so they'll go ahead of you next time.
Zariel Torgan 01:19:44 Seven. So does that mean they'll go on the next round after me or they'll go ahead of me next time? Okay. Let's see. And then bonus action. I don't have any bonus actions. Okay. I will move up to the left.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:17 Yes, I will move right over here.
Dungeon Master 01:20:17 Okay. Okay, okay. After your turn, it'll take another legendary action. And just swipe, just for the ease of keeping with everything, it'll just go for the top one.
Kaladen Shash 01:20:22 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:20:46 And that'll just be a claw attack. Waste of a natural 20. That is first one out. They only have 10 HP, right? With the spell, doesn't it say they have 10, or does it say 11?
Zariel Torgan 01:20:50 It hits. 11, but close enough. Yeah, they're done. Well, the spell just says it's the stat of the creature.
Leopold Magnus 01:21:17 What's their AC?
Zariel Torgan 01:21:19 And so a wolf, because I was wrong earlier, it's not summon beast. Summon beast was Garfield, it's conjure animals. And so it's a CR one quarter animal. And so it's just the stat of a wolf. And then a wolf stat is AC 13 hit points 11.
Dungeon Master 01:21:33 Mm hmm. Yeah, OK. That's just changed, although it doesn't make it doesn't make a huge difference. OK, yeah, 11 HP, but I think with the minimum, it would still wipe it out every time. So first one gone started around Leopold, you are up. As you see it.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:50 Okay. Oh, absolutely.
Dungeon Master 01:22:03 Um, currently there is no way to get to the larger creature without like ranged weapons going to the top. So no. Like no melee attacks, because you can't sort of find an open point with as many wolves that are around it right now, but you have like aerial strike capability. Nice.
Leopold Magnus 01:22:21 With my action, I will create a Bonfire right underneath the creature. That's a DEX save of 16.
Dungeon Master 01:22:39 Tech save the 16. It has a plus 3. That's 6.
Leopold Magnus 01:22:53 Okay, so he'll take 2d8 fire damage. 8 damage. And then with my bonus action, I will cast a magic stone. Oh, nice. 27 to hit.
Kaladen Shash 01:22:54 Wait. That's a mean round right there. You got him for the fire and the silver.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:57 Nice. Nice. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:23:16 27 hits. Very nice. And then at the end of your turn,
Leopold Magnus 01:23:21 Yeah, 10 damage with the stone. Yep, and he is silvered and on fire.
Zariel Torgan 01:23:30 You do.
Dungeon Master 01:23:46 It's turn. Tate, does it take damage at the start of its turn? For being in the bonfire, or at the end of its turn?
Leopold Magnus 01:23:53 What's that? Creature must also make a saving throw when it moves into the bonfire on a turn or ends its turn there. Wait. Moves into the bonfire space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. Yep.
Kaladen Shash 01:23:54 for being in the bonfire. Maybe when it starts its turn.
Dungeon Master 01:24:18 So just the end of the turn does not get its bite back. So instead it'll take, um, it'll use its frightful presence. So I need, um, seven wisdom saving throws from the wolves and then everybody give me, uh, actually everybody else has already, well,
Zariel Torgan 01:24:40 OK. So I have an 18, a 16, and then everything else. OK, so one succeeded. We'll just say the top one. I mean, unless you care.
Kaladen Shash 01:24:45 Is that 96313?
Dungeon Master 01:24:46 No, it hasn't been 24 hours. Everybody else is still immune. So all of the wolves. You were trying to beat an 18. Which one succeeds? What order is that? Well, it gives it in order. So we'll just go top to bottom. So they have a plus one.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:12 Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:25:14 So the orange one succeeds. The rest of them are considered afraid. It will then. It'll be smart about it. Well, is it smart enough to be smart about it? It will attack. No, I don't think it is just first to one after the other.
Kaladen Shash 01:25:19 I'm sorry.
Dungeon Master 01:25:47 First one is a 13 to hit. And then 19 to hit. It does. So the first one would be the 13, because with this advantage, 13 and 19. But 13 still hits then, right? OK. Second attack is back to normal.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:52 Uh, yeah. Did it, did it have disadvantage? Yes. Yeah, it still hits, yeah. Ouch.
Kaladen Shash 01:26:06 Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:26:15 But it could miss 13 again. And then I just want to make sure that they're actually down. It is. How much HP do they have? Oh, yeah. They're just down. I thought maybe. But with the, it does at least half necrotic each time. You see two more.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:22 Yeah, both of them are down. 11.
Dungeon Master 01:26:47 go down, and it will take five attacks of opportunity, and it will move into space with Leopold. But those five attacks are all at disadvantage from the wolves. OK.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:07 All right, so it's gonna be a plus four to hit, but they all have pack tactics, and so they'll just be straight. So, plus four, 17, plus four, 16, 18,
Dungeon Master 01:27:26 17 misses. Misses. Hits. One hit. And does that apply to huge creatures?
Zariel Torgan 01:27:37 Miss. And... 16. Goddamn. Alright, and then that's gonna be 2d4 plus 2, and then I need a dc11 strength saving throw or be knocked prone. It says if the target is a creature.
Kaladen Shash 01:27:38 It is a creature.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:06 So that's gonna be 9 piercing damage. I rolled really well. Yeah, DC 11. I mean, it should have like an insane strength. You have to roll like a 1 or a 1 through 5 to actually fail it. Even with the D10 still.
Dungeon Master 01:28:07 That is. What? What is to save the nugget from strength Dave? Oh, that should be a D20. Why did I do that?
Kaladen Shash 01:28:23 That could happen. Oh, plus seven is going to be so bad. Here we go. Oh, that's so funny. Same number. That's great. That's great.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:36 Yeah, oh that's meant to be meant to be that's funny
Dungeon Master 01:28:40 14. Overall, that was awesome for that long. Okay. After the wolves turn, at the end of a turn it'll use a legendary action and takes one swipe at Leopold. I don't think a 14 hits, though.
Leopold Magnus 01:29:08 No, that won't hit.
Dungeon Master 01:29:09 It is the wolf's turn. It can move to be close enough. Oh no, it's currently out of range. But it can get close. It's yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:29:14 All right. Is the second one down close enough to make an attack? This one here? Or is it? Okay. All right. So just the one? Okay. I'll just make the one attack then straight with a d4. I mean, with an added four. Oh, nice hits. That's 2d4 plus 2.
Kaladen Shash 01:29:27 Can I.
Dungeon Master 01:29:43 Nice. Is this damage considered magical from these creatures?
Zariel Torgan 01:29:45 And then another, nice, so another 8 piercing damage, and then another DC 11 strength save. I don't think it says that it's considered magical. I mean, they're magical because I summoned them, but I don't know if, you know,
Dungeon Master 01:30:11 But they're not magical creatures, because you're just summoning the regular one. I say because it doesn't specify that their attack count is magical. We'll say it doesn't. But six more damage, eight more damage, half to four. Still good. And...
Zariel Torgan 01:30:14 Well, they are. It says they're fey spirits that take the form of beasts. So, I mean, it's up to you. I mean, it's a third-level spell. So I don't know. I don't know if... Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:30:41 Uh, that is the end of their turn. Put Kaladin before your turn. The wolf will still do another swipe. Just trying to take you guys down. What am I doing? Oh, I can just click on it. Uh, 15 doesn't hit. Leo, I'm rolling like dog shit against you. Uh, end of your turn. End of its turn. Kaladin.
Dungeon Master 01:31:13 Got too many things to juggle. Too many damn wolves on this map. Not, uh, oh yes, on this run, because Leopold's at the top, it has been peppered with silver.
Zariel Torgan 01:31:17 Mm-hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:31:19 Logos on the map. Uhm, it's already been peppered with silver and. Looking pretty good. On the top of this round. I'm going to blast off two of this object blasts.
Dungeon Master 01:31:43 Go for it.
Kaladen Shash 01:31:52 Natural one will not do it. That won't do it either, that's a bummer. I'll close the distance, I'll rush in. And I will take a two-handed swipe with light splitter.
Leopold Magnus 01:32:06 Sick music, by the way.
Kaladen Shash 01:32:20 No, that's not. That's a damage role. It's my bad. That's a great damage rule, though. Oh, go ahead. That's cool, we'll take it. And then this is the additional. Oh man, rolling hot. That's the additional radiant on top 18.
Dungeon Master 01:32:24 OK, we're all doing it. If you hit, that can be your damage roll. Great. 18 total.
Zariel Torgan 01:32:35 Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:32:46 Very nice. At the end of your turn, it'll do its final Legendary action, take its final swipe. Not hitting Leopold, it'll take a swipe at the wolf next to you, Kaladin. That hits, so that one's done. Zaryl, your go.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:10 Can I roll four of those to break from the fear? Okay. Do that real quick. Just plus two. Oh, it might have been plus one.
Dungeon Master 01:33:22 Yes. Fail. Fail. Those are just low rolls in general. Don't break it.
Kaladen Shash 01:33:38 Man, wow, one, two, three, bang, bang, bang. Hot shit.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:39 Goddamn. Yeah. Yeah, it'll only take... Okay. Let's see. I am going to use...
Leopold Magnus 01:33:42 One, two, three, yeah. This next one will be four, yeah? Work your way to 20.
Zariel Torgan 01:34:01 Let's see, I'll use my action to, well, I don't know if I want to, well, that's okay. I'll go ahead and I'll use my action and I will move into my bear form. Let's see if I can't mark that off real quick. Go. A mechanized bear bounds forward here with a mechanized top hat.
Kaladen Shash 01:34:29 you
Zariel Torgan 01:34:32 and makes an attack. Just increase my hit point thing so that it's accurate. All right, so I'm gonna take two attacks, one bite and one claw. Let's see. One D, so plus seven. So, okay, first one's plus seven for the bite.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:00 And then the next one is... Jesus, fuck. Okay, well that was a 1 and a 6, so thank you for the reminder. So the 6 plus 7 doesn't hit, and then let's do the other one. Is a 16, or 17 I mean, and a 24. Okay, so one hit. So the claw hits...
Kaladen Shash 01:35:04 or your own with advantage.
Dungeon Master 01:35:06 24, go ahead.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:31 Let's see. And that's going to be 2d6 plus 5 slashing damage. And this is magical, because of my primal strike. So that's going to be 12 slashing damage. And then that is my turn. I'll just flank here. Whoops, I moved the bonfire. Oh shit, is the bonfire still there?
Dungeon Master 01:35:42 Mm-hmm Yeah You can't
Leopold Magnus 01:36:01 Yeah, I don't think I got dispelled yet.
Zariel Torgan 01:36:02 Oh, okay, well here, I'll put it back where it was. I won't go that way then, I'll go over here. So that I'm not. I can't. I thought you could move through friendlies. What about if I went in over here instead?
Dungeon Master 01:36:11 get to it with the wolves there. You'd have to be on the fire. Normally, yes, but when you've got eight wolves in a small space, I'm going to say it just doesn't make sense. You can like get over them. Yeah, that's fine.
Kaladen Shash 01:36:27 Tomorrow. Good.
Zariel Torgan 01:36:35 Or should I... I'll just take the fire damage. What's the save? Is it con? Oh, dex? Fuck. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:36:47 I don't know that. What is the save racks? Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:36:51 Oh, for the fire, uh, DC 16, I think. Yeah. Uh, decks. Uh, 2d8. You will take 14 fire damage.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:05 Uh, no. That's a 7. Is it 2d10? Oh, goddamn. Alright. Uh, that's my turn.
Kaladen Shash 01:37:12 It's, it's too late. We're on, we're on hot, we're on hot.
Dungeon Master 01:37:16 at the heavy wall.
Leopold Magnus 01:37:23 It's a big head. Oh, oh, sorry. Watch out. Watch out for that.
Dungeon Master 01:37:25 Yeah. Friendly fire. Top of the round, Leopold. You watch the wolf sort of plows through the wolves in front, tries to hit you and can't, and then you see Zariel in the bear form jumps in behind it and just steps right in the bonfire, igniting coal and ember everywhere. The whole room flashes red for a second. What do you do?
Leopold Magnus 01:37:50 And I'll kind of stumble backwards, so it looks like I'm pretty much right up against the wall, though. And I have flanking with Zariel. Yeah, so I will unsheathe my sword, you'll hear it crackling, and if you remember I peppered it with some silver power before the fight.
Dungeon Master 01:37:56 Mm-hmm. Not a large space. Yes. Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 01:38:14 And I will take a swing. So I guess, I can't quite remember what the stats were on it, but do the roll to hit, was it? Ah, plus nine to hit, okay. Just roll that. Fuck, 16.
Dungeon Master 01:38:29 Intelligence plus proficiency and it's a plus one, so it's a plus nine to hit. He misses.
Leopold Magnus 01:38:46 Yeah, so I'll swing wide, missing, and my last stone in hand, I will focus on the wolf, and launch that as my bonus action. Ah, but 25 I think will connect. And he'll take 11 damage.
Dungeon Master 01:39:04 25 will hit, yes. 11 more damage. Yes, it was. Two of three of those. OK.
Zariel Torgan 01:39:10 Nice. Rowan, fantastic on that.
Leopold Magnus 01:39:15 And that was a silver hit, so. That's my turn and I'm done.
Kaladen Shash 01:39:25 All right.
Dungeon Master 01:39:31 A lot going on. Start of the round. Start of its turn. See if they get... the fight. Another one. No, they don't. One swipe on both Leopold and then Kaladin. First tech Leopold. 18 doesn't hit.
Leopold Magnus 01:40:00 missus uh yeah i'll dismiss it now that uh zariel's standing over the top of it
Dungeon Master 01:40:01 Attack on Kaladin. 21 to hit. Jailed, figured that was coming. Alrighty. After that is the four remaining wolves. Leopold, did you still want the bonfire or did you want to dismiss it? Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:40:07 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:09 Nice. You said? So we ruled this one's too far away to hit.
Dungeon Master 01:40:33 Yes. OK, you're looking for a 17. My. This guy down here laughing in line succeeds no longer afraid.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:34 Okay, so then I'll just make the rolls for them. It's plus one on the wisdom. So four plus one. One of them succeeds with a natural 20. The rest of them fail. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:04 But he can't move because it's at the end of his turn. Because after everything is when you get it. So he's done. And then Kaladin.
Dungeon Master 01:41:08 Gotcha, okay. At the end of their turn, the wolf will go again, another legendary action, first one of this round. Really sucks not getting its bite. It'll do one attack on the bear just to keep it moving around the circle. 19 hit the bear.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:33 Oh yeah. Bear's big and soft, even though it's metal. Bear Kong. Plus three, so a d20 plus three.
Dungeon Master 01:41:41 That was the funny imagery. 2d8 plus 5. And then give me a con save. All right, you take 16 necrotic damage.
Kaladen Shash 01:41:41 Weak points, weak points.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:02 So that's a six. Okay. Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:42:14 But then it is Caledon's turn. Yeah. Silver but no fire this turn.
Kaladen Shash 01:42:22 Uh, yeah, I am going to. So it already took a silver hit again, correct? I will have. Right, well, I have advantage if I just do a melee attack on it. Is it considered harried with much allies around it? You know everyone directly?
Dungeon Master 01:42:49 Uh, no, I'll say does Pack Tactics apply? No, it doesn't. I think it's Double Stun Fair. I will say Leopold and Zariel have them. Yeah, like the Harried, but you're just like, you're just not quite in line enough. You could skirt maybe enough next to Leopold, you could get it, because Zariel's so big. But like right where you are, it's a little too perpendicular.
Kaladen Shash 01:43:00 Okay. That's okay, I'll use a bonus. No, I can't do that. Okay, I'm gonna just take a straight up attack.
Kaladen Shash 01:43:32 Oh, crit fail. Just swinging a miss. And then I'll use a misty step to reset further back, back to kind of where I was up against the wall at the entrance.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:34 Oof I know how it feels
Dungeon Master 01:43:35 Just an odd die. Nice, just back up over here. At the end of your turn, it'll use its second legendary action. Take a swipe at Leopold.
Dungeon Master 01:44:11 22 to hit Leopold. Okay. Sorry, your turn.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:14 Uh, that would hit, but I'll use a shield.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:21 Wild. Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll take, uh, two attacks with advantage. So I'll just hit two here. So these are both plus seven. So that's going to be, god damn, uh, 14 on the first, on the bite. And, uh, both those hit. Okay. So one, one hit and it's the claw.
Dungeon Master 01:44:40 And.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:51 And that's going to be 2d6 plus 5. So let's see what we got. All right, 4. So that's 9 slashing damage from the bear claw. And then I still don't have any bonus action economy because of that. So that is it. Actually, I'll move as far this way as I can. How far that way can I get? Can I get like here?
Dungeon Master 01:45:21 I think that's good, yeah. End of your turn, we'll use its last legendary action, take a swipe at you. 21. Made a con save. 14 slashing.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:24 All right, then that's all I got. Bring it. Yeah. Plus three. That's a crit fail.
Kaladen Shash 01:45:35 I just did that.
Dungeon Master 01:45:55 Didn't you just do that? And 15 more necrotic damage, so 29 on that.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:57 Ah, yes. Ouch. Alright, so that makes it back to me, and then another 16 damage to me. I am back out of my bear form. Into my metal man form.
Dungeon Master 01:46:25 Very nice. That's OK. All good. Have a round. Leopold, you're up.
Zariel Torgan 01:46:25 And then I need to... I have not been making concentration checks. Let me just make this latest one real quick. Cool. Okay. Okay, yeah. We're good. Just wanted to cover the last few.
Leopold Magnus 01:46:53 Let's see, so I will again take another swing with my sword. Has anyone else silvered it? Or I guess that only accounts for the round, right? I see, OK. So with my sword taking a strike with advantage, which I didn't do last time.
Zariel Torgan 01:46:59 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:47:05 No, you're the top of the round, so you'd be the one that would be keeping it from healing at this point. Did you, are you bonus actioning resilvering it? Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:47:25 Yeah, bonus action to re-silver it. Yep, exactly. Fuck me. 16 to hit. That's my action and my bonus action. Nothing else I can do. That's my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:47:36 Doesn't quite hit. Missed it. OK. It is this wolf's turn. A lot of people in here.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:05 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:48:05 We'll see. First, does the pup get her bite back from the bubble? God. No. OK. I'm just going to focus up a bit. We'll just do two swipes at Zariel, because that tends to work better.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:34 Bring it on. My AC is insane now. So, it's not that insane.
Kaladen Shash 01:48:36 Wait, what's... Yeah, because he's a freaking... Is that insane?
Dungeon Master 01:48:37 Ooh, first one might be a miss, 14. 28 on the second one. 13 slashing damage, give me a con save.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:04 Oof. Nine. All right, roll to see if I maintain natural 20. So yeah, on the maintaining my concentration, I'm rolling at 20. So that was 13 plus 17. 30 damage. Just a cool 30.
Dungeon Master 01:49:07 And 17 more necrotic damage. 30 on that total. Yeah, 30 total. And then have three of the wolves roll wisdom saves and then that one can take its action.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:34 All right. No. No. Oh, no, that's a success. Oh, shit. Two of them succeeded. So only one of them's scared. All right, this one's going to run up. Now it's got to actually hit. So that's going to be plus 4. 22 to hit.
Kaladen Shash 01:49:44 Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Dungeon Master 01:49:45 Nice. Nice, the first one's afraid and the other two are good. But green one at the bottom can take its turn. Going two hits.
Zariel Torgan 01:50:07 2d4 plus 2, that's 4. Half to 2. And then I need that strength check, dc11. Yeah, he's good.
Dungeon Master 01:50:30 Uh, 22. OK. Uh. Sorry, what is your your? Initiative count was fine, right? No, yeah. Yeah, after the wolves turn it is then.
Zariel Torgan 01:50:49 I'm not sure why. Yeah, I'm not sure why I moved up there. Should be Kaladin next. No.
Dungeon Master 01:51:00 It'll do a legendary action. Swipe at that wolf that just hit it. It was almost a nat 2. 21 to hit. This one goes away. And then it is Kaladin's turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:22 No. Not Betty. I thought he hit with a, oh, nevermind. Nevermind. Nevermind. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:51:30 Uhm? Reminded was there a silver inflicted wound this time? This round. The still defender didn't have it coded, I don't think. Oh no.
Dungeon Master 01:51:38 No, not yet. The defender's dead. His sword didn't hit. No silver yet. Oh, it would have healed on its turn then.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:53 the crossbow thing.
Dungeon Master 01:52:07 Thank you for that reminder.
Kaladen Shash 01:52:32 Alright. Um? I'm gonna close the distance and I'll cast chill touch. Almost a good role. You think nothing happens? Super.
Dungeon Master 01:52:46 Nice. Bonus action.
Kaladen Shash 01:53:07 Already cast a spell so I can't, can't cast any other spell. Got another bonus action. I'll, I'll spend this round coding, I'll bonus action code my weapon.
Dungeon Master 01:53:17 Nice. Okay. The end of your turn. The wolf will take another swipe. It'll do. Just try Leopold again. 25 to hit.
Leopold Magnus 01:53:36 Let's see. Well, the shield has already passed, right? That was, or when was that done? Yeah. Yeah, I'll take that.
Kaladen Shash 01:53:50 At least over a round we'll go.
Dungeon Master 01:53:51 That was a couple rounds, yeah. Okay. Give me a con save. You take 15 slashing damage and... And 14, so 29 damage total.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:53 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:54:09 and on the concept.
Dungeon Master 01:54:22 And, Zariel, it is your turn. This is pretty even so far. No, because they only just saved... Yeah, they just saved this round.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:27 Um, let's see. I think those wolves would have gotten to go, right? Oh, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Okay. All right.
Kaladen Shash 01:54:32 No, they're saved at the end of their turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:46 Okay, so let's see. I will bonus action hit my superior stem. Not superior as in like actual superior, just better than it used to be. So 44 plus 4. Because I am hurt. So 12 hit points for me. And then let's see what I want to do as an action.
Dungeon Master 01:54:57 The better one, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:55:06 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:17 I will. Hmm. I'll hit it with a thunder wave. That's a con 15. It's a cube, 15 foot cube.
Kaladen Shash 01:55:38 Loving this Zelda. Ron.
Dungeon Master 01:55:38 But it was a cone, right? What kind of save is that?
Zariel Torgan 01:55:51 So I figure I'd just put it angled spun so that it's not hitting everybody. I'd put it there or something. Con 15.
Kaladen Shash 01:56:11 Into the wall.
Dungeon Master 01:56:16 It gets a plus four to this. Almost enough to 20, but it's a six. Already up against the wall, but just like big thud against the wall. And takes the eight damage.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:28 All right, it takes eight thunder damage. And it is blasted 10 feet away.
Dungeon Master 01:56:46 You also see that the pups that were sort of on this side of the wall up against the corner there are trapped in the cube and you see them hit the wall really hard and they don't sort of get up at the same pace at least that this large wolf does. This wolf hits the wall. End of your turn looks down and you see just
Dungeon Master 01:57:11 If you thought it was pissed before the rage that fills its eyes at the sight of the unmoving pups, it turns and focuses solely on you and it will take last legendary action on you. Oh, that's embarrassing. Just a forgotten R, you know. 30-20 to hit.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:25 Fuck them kids. Miss me, bitch? Nah, you, the wolf. Yeah, I'm just bobbing and weaving. Look out. Cool.
Kaladen Shash 01:57:36 I don't want to say anything. It is exactly right.
Dungeon Master 01:57:47 Nice. Up top, Leopold.
Leopold Magnus 01:58:00 Yeah. I'm going to do a, I'm going to, this time, pop up some silver coins into my hands. And I'll kind of, into my gauntlet, almost like a arcade machine that you're loading full of quarters, kind of slot them in between where my fingers are. And with a ramrod, kind of shove them down into my arm.
Dungeon Master 01:58:22 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 01:58:29 hold up my hand and blast him with a set of five or six coins, come flying out my gauntlet. I'll do catapult. And that's a deck save of 16. Yep, he'll save that.
Zariel Torgan 01:58:39 the Jews.
Dungeon Master 01:58:55 That is a dirty 20. Blast fly. I don't think so. Unless it says so. I think catapult might be all or nothing.
Leopold Magnus 01:59:01 Um, but he'll still take half damage, right? Oh, let me see. Failed save, the object strikes a target or stops moving. When the object strikes something, the, uh, object and what it strikes each take 3d8 bludgeoning. Oh, yeah. Yep. Got it.
Kaladen Shash 01:59:08 I think catapult. So it didn't strike it. Right, no strike. No strike.
Dungeon Master 01:59:24 But if it saves, it doesn't. Yeah. Nice. OK, it started its turn.
Leopold Magnus 01:59:33 Then with my bonus action, I will call up magic stone That's my turn
Dungeon Master 01:59:56 It gets its bite finally. Sorry, I'm going to bite you. Yeah, what was that you said about fucking them kids? Oh, natural one. Can't focus. Wolves turn. The three remaining wolves are still afraid, so at the end of their turn they can make the wisdom saves.
Zariel Torgan 01:59:59 Uh oh. No. I didn't want to. He's too angry.
Kaladen Shash 02:00:06 I'll be killer. That's just too enraged came focus. One roll to attack.
Zariel Torgan 02:00:24 No, no. No, I had all but one of them succeed, so only one of them is afraid. Yeah, this one... Yeah. So I'll... Yeah, so I'll move these guys up here. And then I'll have them attack. So that's gonna be... Each of these plus four is for the first attack. Both miss. Okay. And then... This is for the second one.
Dungeon Master 02:00:29 Oh, right, the two. So the one, the top one makes it again, bottom two abnormally.
Zariel Torgan 02:00:56 And I both miss. OK. And then this is for the plus one to save. And it saves. So none of them are afraid anymore. And they're up in the business. But that's it. Me? What did I ever do? But I made more.
Dungeon Master 02:01:04 Hey, hey. The end of their turn, gonna take another bite at you. Yeah. He killed his kids, you know. 14. Can't roll high. Fumbling. Kaladin, your turn.
Kaladen Shash 02:01:19 Copy killer. I'm gonna. Go ahead and do a weapon attack with light splitter.
Zariel Torgan 02:01:27 Mm-hmm How the turntables
Dungeon Master 02:01:39 Yeah, I'd say it'd be hard to justify you not having it. 23 hits.
Kaladen Shash 02:01:46 With this many enemies around, would I have advantage at this point now? All right, that's cool. 23 to hit. It's rolling.
Dungeon Master 02:02:20 Still rolling. Yeah, first one is just didn't come through at all. 17 silver to tag.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:22 I didn't get anything on my side. It's not up. Here it comes. There you go. That won't come through. There you go. And then. Those those so 16. It's a silver attack.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:32 There you go. Nice. That's a silver to tech, isn't it? Nice.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:54 Uh? Bonus action. I'll just try anyway. I'll go ahead and do two of this object blasts with disadvantage just cause I'm so close. No, it doesn't. Doesn't do anything. No, no, those are all just garbage rolls. Nothing happens.
Dungeon Master 02:03:08 Mm-hmm. Doesn't it? OK. The end of your turn, it'll just take a swipe at a wolf now. Needs a little pick-me-up 12 to hit.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:15 Hmm. It for it forgave me. Oh, I think it's AC 13. Look at that. Unbelievable.
Dungeon Master 02:03:38 Misses just not doing anything right now. It's already your turn
Kaladen Shash 02:03:41 We're in rage. Last three attacks.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:43 All right. He's just angry. He's hangry. He needs to eat. Let's see. I don't have anything good to use my actions for. Let's see. You know what? I will... No, I won't. Never mind. I'll do another Thunder Wave. I'll do this one at second level.
Zariel Torgan 02:04:16 So that's going to be a con save 15. Better. OK. Half of 18, so nine thunder damage. And do I get more of the pups in there? Oh, OK.
Dungeon Master 02:04:25 It's a plus 4, 21. Oh, no, you killed all the ones on this side. It's up against the wall. There's nowhere to go.
Kaladen Shash 02:04:40 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:04:45 So he's not thrown backwards. Oh, yeah, I know. I mean, he's not like like he succeeded, so he doesn't have to like, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh. That is their AC.
Dungeon Master 02:04:57 Oh, he's not. Gotcha. Into your turn, last legendary action. Again, now we're just saving pride. See if we can kill a wolf. Oh man. 13? Yeah, me too. So I'm gonna kill it. Top of the round, Leopold.
Kaladen Shash 02:05:12 Move to base. Yep.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:15 Oh, I like the pink one.
Leopold Magnus 02:05:28 Yeah, so, Kaladin, you hit it with a silvered weapon, right? Okay, excellent. Um, so then, since I have my stones up, I will use my bonus action to silver my sword, and I will strike it. Advantage, because it's harried. There we go, 25 to hit.
Kaladen Shash 02:05:55 Silence.
Dungeon Master 02:05:57 25 hits. 1D8 plus six. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:58 Yeah. Nice.
Leopold Magnus 02:05:59 Okay, can you remind me what the damage is? It's like a 1D something plus whatever, but then 1D8 plus 6, and then it was a 1D4 of fire damage, right? Okay. Ooh, plus 6, so 13, and then on the D4...
Leopold Magnus 02:06:28 Ooh, nice, so 15 damage with that swing. And that's silvered, but more importantly, also my stones got silvered. Bonus action. So, I silvered my stones.
Dungeon Master 02:06:33 Nice. Nice. Brown, good setup. Very nice. After your turn, it's turn, going to see one if we get the fight back.
Kaladen Shash 02:06:33 It's great. Yeah, they did. You dip those stones in color.
Zariel Torgan 02:06:42 Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:07:02 Not on this round. Everybody's so fucking hard to hit. Just in theory, or just resume going after Zariel, even though it's kind of a losing battle. Well, that might do it. 27 to hit. And second swipe. 24 to hit.
Zariel Torgan 02:07:21 Maybe. Yeah. Oof. Yeah, both hit. I might go down. That's a two.
Kaladen Shash 02:07:24 Just earlier.
Dungeon Master 02:07:38 Maybe. Give me two con saves. First one will be a fail. First one fails, second one passes, so you'll take 66 of Necrotic instead. One full, one half.
Zariel Torgan 02:07:50 And that's a 18. I go with a 6 and an 18, I guess. OK. That makes me feel better. Oh, I'm done. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:08:08 But 28 slashing damage on the claws. Plus 20 necrotic. They lived how they died. Full of life.
Kaladen Shash 02:08:09 Well. Oh. Yeah. OK.
Zariel Torgan 02:08:18 I am unconscious. And that means my wolves are gone. Afraid most of the time.
Leopold Magnus 02:08:38 How is the wolf looking?
Dungeon Master 02:08:42 uh decent damage being sustained it's not like on death's door or anything but because it did quite a bit so far it did get those two heal rounds in but that's it so far uh kaladin you were up
Kaladen Shash 02:09:06 I am going to. Take a swing. I'm guessing this is going to be a regular attack, no advantage. Actually. I want to. Correct, I'll stay within melee range. Can I be here and be hearing that? Is that good enough right there? Boom.
Dungeon Master 02:09:15 Mm-hmm. It'll let you swing all the way around. You can get on the other side of Sariel since he's not upright. You can just step right over him.
Kaladen Shash 02:09:37 I will do. Light splitter with advantage. Definitely hits. Damage is 7. And then plus 411. Then I'll I'll bonus actions to range.
Dungeon Master 02:10:00 And do is metallic brush. And this is one of the ones you purchased right because the ones in your suit can't be used for that perfect.
Kaladen Shash 02:10:08 Some part of. It's Ariel's. Robotic form. Yeah. Right into one of the pipelines. Yeah. Correct, is your correct greater? This is one of the greater so you can go ahead and do a 44 plus 4.
Zariel Torgan 02:10:22 I got some goop in there somewhere. Okay. Much appreciated. Ooh, I roll better on this one.
Dungeon Master 02:10:41 At the end of your turn, it'll take an attack on you. Not Zariel, but Kaladin. I don't think that hits. 13. Perfect. Zariel, start of your turn, whatever hit points you have, you are up.
Kaladen Shash 02:10:51 Does not hit.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:02 All right. I am having a brain fart on how to add my health after dying. Oh, here it is. There we go. Okay. As I pop up, I will cast a third round Flaming Sphere.
Dungeon Master 02:11:14 You just gotta change your, like add health. Avoid the death save part.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:30 No, a second level Flaming Sphere. It'll appear and I'll have it just crash into him right here. And then bonus action, I will take another healing potion. I think I just have a regular. Not a great or anything. I think I have the one of the cheapest ones left.
Dungeon Master 02:11:55 If your suit was Mm-hmm
Zariel Torgan 02:11:56 be four plus two. That's gonna be six. I already used my suit one. I had a, from when we originally bought potions, I had two. Okay. And so that's gonna be a flaming sphere, that's gonna be a deck save, 15. You know what, I'll do it at third level.
Kaladen Shash 02:12:07 This long rest. OK.
Dungeon Master 02:12:34 22. Has disadvantage on its next attack. Which is good because Legendary Action will take an attack at you at disadvantage.
Zariel Torgan 02:12:36 All right, he succeeds, but he still takes, uh, five fire damage. What? Hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:13:01 First one is a 19. Second one is a 18. So 27 is the lower of the two. Maybe not. If I roll really low, I'm not just saying I can roll. I think I can roll low enough.
Kaladen Shash 02:13:06 Miss. It's a bummer. Missed barely.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:08 Hmm. Yes, I am absolutely going down. All right, let me write that damage put in first. All right.
Dungeon Master 02:13:28 Nine, slashing damage, give me a con save. I think it's an 18. It is. And then, yeah, 13 more, so you are down again, which is how it likes it. You take out
Zariel Torgan 02:13:38 Uh, 17. Flaming sphere disappears.
Kaladen Shash 02:13:39 Don't say it wouldn't been enough anyway would have taken him right down
Dungeon Master 02:13:58 it's children it takes you out top of the round leopold sorry once again downed but uh having taken both fire and silver you know you're you're really putting the fight to it
Kaladen Shash 02:14:15 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:14:16 Yeah, making some progress here. I can slide over here without taking an attack of opportunity, right? Excellent. Then I will administer. Does Zario have any syringes left on his person? OK.
Dungeon Master 02:14:28 Yes. No, he just used his last one. But if you only have the ones provided for free by your suit, that's correct.
Zariel Torgan 02:14:39 Uh, no, I think I used the last thing I had. No.
Leopold Magnus 02:14:46 And I guess the syringes I have can't be used on him. Oh boy, yeah, I think I... I don't think I had any other health potions. Uh, Zariel, do you have any on your person? Just a health potion? Oh boy. Um...
Kaladen Shash 02:15:08 I can get him. I can get him making it up.
Leopold Magnus 02:15:15 I guess, okay, okay, yeah. So then with sword in hand, I will strike, and I'll just stay where I was instead of move over there. I'll strike. Come on, yeah, 26 to hit. Okay, 1d8. And that was plus five, right?
Dungeon Master 02:15:37 26 sets. Plus six.
Kaladen Shash 02:15:43 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:15:48 Oh, plus 6, excellent. So that's 9, and then I will do a magic stone. Oh, I have the fire damage. Yeah, so 9 plus 4, 13 damage with the sword, and also some fire in there.
Leopold Magnus 02:16:10 And then with my bonus action, I will roll to hit a stone. 19, 27 to hit. That connects. Another, yep, silver stone, nine damage. Zinging by, doing some rough hits. Which, yeah, I don't know if you guys hit him with silver this round, so that may have been critical there. Sweet.
Dungeon Master 02:16:19 27 hits. Nice. I think that was absolutely necessary, actually. Good round at the end of your turn. It has a legend, so start of its turn.
Kaladen Shash 02:16:19 Yes. That's a Silverstone. That's perfect.
Zariel Torgan 02:16:24 Sweet. Awesome. Yeah, that was a fantastic round.
Dungeon Master 02:16:49 It's health finally transitioned to the yellow. You guys are making good work. See if we get our bite back. Just fours and ones. Do not. Calvin, you're looking pretty healthy, right? Okay, it'll, you know, I want to say it's like it's blood fury will go after the more hurt but harder to hit of the two. It'll try to take two swipes at Leopold.
Kaladen Shash 02:16:57 Very healthy. Of course, fry.
Zariel Torgan 02:17:06 We're focused.
Dungeon Master 02:17:25 25 to hit, natural 16, and a natural 20. OK, so we'll count. So the first one will be the 25 to hit. And second one is a 23 to hit.
Kaladen Shash 02:17:32 Had a disadvantage on the first one. Yep. Yep.
Leopold Magnus 02:17:40 Yeah, that's true, because it was fired, right? Oh, OK. Yeah, you're rerolling the nat 20? I'll take it. Yeah, I'll do a shield on that and use my last burst level spell slot, and neither of those will hit.
Dungeon Master 02:17:57 Yeah. OK. OK. Calden, your go.
Kaladen Shash 02:18:08 Boom. I am going to bonus action pump another syringe into Dariel. Goddammit, stay up this time. And then I'll make another attack with light splitter.
Zariel Torgan 02:18:09 Nice. Thank you, thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:18:38 with advantage first one's 14 second one it's not going to hit it's not going to hit another 44 it's another greater it's just it's just i don't know it's okay it still hits pretty well
Zariel Torgan 02:18:44 Hmm. Is that a 2D2 plus 2 or a 4D4 plus 4? OK. Damn.
Dungeon Master 02:18:45 That's not hit. Your sword should definitely be more than plus six to hit. Why is it always broken for you? Yeah, but you should have. Like it should be on par should be like a plus eight or plus nine to hit.
Dungeon Master 02:19:17 Why is that not the case? What's your strength? Well, what's your dex then? Plus four, so efficiency plus four is plus six, and it's a plus two weapon, so it should be a plus eight to hit.
Kaladen Shash 02:19:17 I'm pretty sure you've got... I don't know. I think it's set to... I think it's set to Dex. My Dex is a 19. It's a plus 4. The modifier is pretty good. My proficiency is 3.
Dungeon Master 02:19:47 So four and three is seven plus two, it's nine. So it's still, it's way under, I don't know why it keeps, it seems like your character is the only one it does that with. And I don't know why. Maybe it's just I have something against you. But a plus three doesn't get you a hit in both of those.
Kaladen Shash 02:19:51 Yeah. I can. I can give it up.
Zariel Torgan 02:20:06 It's just us.
Dungeon Master 02:20:19 End of your turn though, we'll use a slap, try to hit Leopold. What is your current AC with the shield? That doesn't matter, it doesn't hit. Okay. Zariel, your turn.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:30 26.
Kaladen Shash 02:20:39 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:20:39 Alright. I'll go ahead and... Dammit. I'll cast Healing Spirit.
Zariel Torgan 02:21:07 and that'll be a bonus action. And it's gonna appear right here next to Leo. It's just gonna be a large kinda just like fat teddy bear version of my bear form with a top hat. And it's gonna heal 1d6 every round. So that's gonna be three healing.
Dungeon Master 02:21:17 Is it just two people within five feet? Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:21:41 Healing Spirit? Yeah, yeah, it's gotta be right on top of him. And then, uh, that was my bonus action, and then action I'm going to transform into my bear again.
Dungeon Master 02:21:47 They pulled you here. Three. Nice.
Kaladen Shash 02:21:57 That's great. A ton of temporaries.
Dungeon Master 02:22:19 Okay. Uh, good round. End of your turn. I mean, not that it will have much better luck with Kaladin because your AC is pretty close, but we'll just swivel. Of course I rolled that then at 27. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:34 That'd be. Rex, did you take that hit, those hit points? Yeah, for you, yeah. Every round, you can take another D6 for like a minute. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:22:38 And me? Yes. Yes.
Leopold Magnus 02:22:49 Oh, I didn't realize three. Three heals. Oh, nice. Excellent. That's more than what I had. Thanks.
Dungeon Master 02:23:07 And then Kaladin give me that Khan save. Awesome. 27 damage total. And then we start the round again. Leopold.
Kaladen Shash 02:23:19 Negative.
Leopold Magnus 02:23:38 Yeah, let's finish this. Let's finish this, and I'll slash another lightning blade at him. Oh, this is the start? Nice.
Zariel Torgan 02:23:47 You can take another d6, because whenever you start your turn... Yeah. So anytime you go in there for the first and when you start. So this one kind of doubled up nicely.
Leopold Magnus 02:24:01 And so I'll take, yeah, another three points of heals. And I will slash at this beast. Be gone! 26 to hit. I believe it does. Oh. Potent. Uh, so that's 14. That's plus 6. And then a d4.
Dungeon Master 02:24:18 There's the kid. Wait. Not silver, but fire.
Leopold Magnus 02:24:32 Uh, another 2 on that. So, um, yeah. Nice. Uh, 16. 16 damage on that sword strike. None of that was silvered, but I do have some stone. Yeah, and it was fire. So... What's that? I think I did, yeah. Unless you guys were able to hit him with silver on your turn.
Kaladen Shash 02:24:42 No, and none of that was silver Okay, and who had the most recent silver attack Okay, yeah, okay
Zariel Torgan 02:25:00 Hmm. Are these stones silvered? Nice. Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:25:02 No silver in the long time so far. 20 hits.
Leopold Magnus 02:25:05 Alright, uh, so the stone... 20 to hit. Excellent. Yeah, cause I had... I brought 3 up, I silvered them all, and I've used 1, so I'll have 1 remaining after this one connects. 9 damage. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:25:16 That one is. It's perfect. Nine silver damage.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:30 Awesome. OK.
Dungeon Master 02:25:32 Nice. Good turn, keeping it crippled. Start of the round, does not get the bite back, but will take... Bear looks healthy, Leopold's healing. We'll do a strike on Kaladin and a strike on the bear.
Leopold Magnus 02:25:35 Excellent, and that's my turn.
Dungeon Master 02:26:05 First one on Kaladin. 19 to hit. Next one on the bear. It's a natural play.
Kaladen Shash 02:26:11 Uh, shield. Soft self. Oh, first nat 20. Yeah, holy. Yeah. This knows you have the hit points to bleed out. Just go.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:13 Nice. Hits. It's alright. Yeah, I was gonna say. Alright.
Dungeon Master 02:26:34 I wish the 20 would have been used on you. What are you talking about? You guys either I don't hit or you shield and I don't hit. Give me a con save. That is.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:45 It's the same as me, so I'll just roll it for me. Yeah. I might die. Okay. All right. 16. I have two hit points.
Dungeon Master 02:27:03 58 points of damage total. As the bear or as Zariel? Oh jeez, I did not realize you went that low.
Kaladen Shash 02:27:04 Eight. Airforms up. You're still alive, you're still alive. It's Dario. You got. You got dropped.
Zariel Torgan 02:27:17 As Zariel. Well, I only had 42 as a bear, and then I only had 18 as me.
Dungeon Master 02:27:33 Um. Well, great news is it's Caledon's turn. And not the, uh, the wolves again. But it missed out in any way.
Kaladen Shash 02:27:44 Yeah. Uhm? That's great, been silvered. Yes, it did. Also the. Yeah. Alright, I'm gonna attack with light splitter. Oh, it's got advantage, but that'll that'll hit.
Zariel Torgan 02:27:49 Did the sword. Did that sword have fire damage? Did. Oh, gotcha. OK, never mind. That's all good. Yeah, that makes sense.
Leopold Magnus 02:28:01 Yeah, it's only the first strike, right?
Dungeon Master 02:28:04 Yeah. I'll hit, see if it corrects.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:16 That'll first, that'll, nope, that'll first screw your head. Oh, it's a great, it's a 10. It's not gonna show you that zero. Perfect. Disappeared. Here it comes again. Oh, now it's a two. That's all right. And we're at two. Ah.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:22 Nice. Seven's not nothing.
Dungeon Master 02:28:37 Heh heh heh.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:47 7 is not nothing. I'll go. I'll go ahead and just try to blast it with. This object blasts again with disadvantage, assuming you're lucky. No, it's a mess. Yes, it's a bummer. Blasting the ground.
Dungeon Master 02:29:07 One good hit, though. End of your turn, we'll use a slash. We'll just go back up to the top at Leopold. Keep it even. 19 misses. Zariel, your turn.
Zariel Torgan 02:29:33 Um, let's see. Ah, shit. I got a cat that's stepping on my wireless.
Zariel Torgan 02:29:43 keep bored that I have somewhere else fucking up my screen. All right, it just dropped my whole page. All right, I am back. Okay, I will, let's see, I'll leave the healing spirit over there. I will take an action and...
Kaladen Shash 02:29:43 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:29:45 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:30:13 Can't use a spell as a bonus action if I use a spell as an action, right? That's the way that works. What if it's a cantrip as an action? Well...
Kaladen Shash 02:30:18 What?
Dungeon Master 02:30:19 Yeah. No. They could attack as an action and cantrip as a bonus action if you have that.
Zariel Torgan 02:30:42 really have much in the way of anything. I'll just heal myself I guess as a bonus action. 13. Alright. And then, well I guess I can still like, punch him. I have an Arm Strike.
Kaladen Shash 02:30:52 Here you go.
Dungeon Master 02:30:52 Thank you. You could.
Zariel Torgan 02:31:13 Uh, here we go. I have advantage. Yeah. Alright.
Dungeon Master 02:31:24 Nice. End of your turn. We'll take an attack on Kaladin. Um, 19. You still have shield. Top of the round. Leopold, you were up. You guys are fucking impossible. The rest of the campaign is just gonna be mages that make you make saves.
Kaladen Shash 02:31:35 I saw. Yeah. He's getting hurt or he's orange now.
Leopold Magnus 02:31:46 Oh, how is this? Oh, geez. How is this wolf looking? Yeah. Oh, gee. I mean, if you were hitting us, we would just be dead. So it's probably best you don't. Oh, yes. Thank you for good looking out.
Dungeon Master 02:31:56 Yeah, you guys are under triple digits. But I can't hit you.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:10 Leo, roll another d6 too, because you started your turn again. No.
Kaladen Shash 02:32:14 That's what it takes.
Leopold Magnus 02:32:18 You know, just ticking up little by little here. Yep. So, damn, this guy has a lot of hit points. I feel like we hit him a lot. I'm going to just slice him again with my sword. 18 to hit. Oh, thank God.
Dungeon Master 02:32:42 It's. That'll be fire damage to give a disadvantage. Good for you, man. Good rap.
Leopold Magnus 02:32:52 Uh, seven and then for the fire. 8 damage. Get out here and I slice again. Kind of striking the. Uh, yeah, my last one.
Kaladen Shash 02:33:00 Wow, bringing it soft. No.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:02 Impressive.
Dungeon Master 02:33:13 Are you doing a magic stone at all? No other soul to pack this round. I don't think you miss ever with your magic stone.
Leopold Magnus 02:33:19 So unless, did you guys hit it with some silver yet? All right, there it goes. Let's see. Nice, 27. That was close. It was a one and it flipped to a 19, so I'll take it.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:36 Not this round. Awesome. That was fantastic.
Kaladen Shash 02:33:36 Get great in. Wow, that's you did as low as you could have all of them. Crazy for that, that is. But but the most important kinds of damage. Well done, well done.
Dungeon Master 02:33:46 That gets the bite back but won't use it yet will instead do God what the fuck do I do? Um
Leopold Magnus 02:33:50 Uh, exactly. As little as I could possibly do without missing. But, yep. Silver and fire, so, yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:34:17 I think up next on the list would be strike at Zariel and then back at the top Leopold. Just keep it even between you guys. Nobody's killed a pup in a while. The natural one on Zariel. Natural four.
Zariel Torgan 02:34:40 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:34:40 Nice. All right. I will attack. Yes.
Dungeon Master 02:34:47 on Leopold. No dice. Paladin, your turn. That's a 20 hit.
Leopold Magnus 02:34:51 Not making contact.
Kaladen Shash 02:35:09 Natural 20. That'll be 2D10 plus. Is the modifier doubled or just regular? And then is the additional dye doubled? Is that what you're saying? Sweet.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:10 Nice. Nice, nice, nice, nice. Damn.
Dungeon Master 02:35:29 Everything's doubled, yeah. Yep. 2d10, 2d6, plus whatever. Nice. Good damage, though. Nice.
Kaladen Shash 02:35:41 Six. OK, not great, not great, but fun 22. Having done that, I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and action surge. And do it again. And the 27 to hit.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:58 Absolutely.
Dungeon Master 02:36:06 27 hits. Not showing me that one either.
Kaladen Shash 02:36:11 Oh, that's another 10 on the dice. I don't know why the number won't show up. The roll's just sitting on the deck. Here it comes again. It's all right. I'll just roll it. I don't know why they're not showing up. I didn't even see that one land.
Dungeon Master 02:36:34 It's like it's just getting stuck before it lands.
Kaladen Shash 02:36:45 Well, here we go. 17 And then I'll just I'll just wildly do this object blast again with disadvantage. Oh, one of them hits. It's for forced damage and then here comes a second. Nope.
Zariel Torgan 02:36:47 Hey. Nice. Damn.
Dungeon Master 02:37:05 Nice. It's a good round. Looking real hurt. The end of your turn is going to Legendary Action and do its bite on you though.
Kaladen Shash 02:37:13 That's all right, that's all right. It was a nice round. That provoked it a little.
Zariel Torgan 02:37:16 That was a fantastic round.
Dungeon Master 02:37:38 Thank fucking god I hit. Come on, man. 27 to go. Yeah, this is the big hit too. That's 2d10 plus 5. 19 piercing for the bite.
Kaladen Shash 02:37:42 27 is outside my reach, yeah, it hits. And a con save. You're legendary, yeah. Might go down for a second. Crap. Ah, it's an 18 to a three.
Kaladen Shash 02:38:12 That's the con save right there. It'll be like full damage. Is there going to be necrotic? I assume that's what I'm getting right now. Yeah. OK. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:38:15 Mmm.
Dungeon Master 02:38:17 OK. Yeah. But with the bite. In the failure on the bite, you take a total of. 41 damage. 43 damage, sorry.
Dungeon Master 02:38:41 And you feel just a pulse from the bite, just a boom through your body as something else takes root. Yeah. So Ariel, your turn. Are you down with that? Yes, you are. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:38:52 Oh. All right, bonus action, I'm gonna move. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:38:52 For flavor, can I say that it bit my arm? Okay. Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:39:11 Bonus action, I've got two charges left of the Healing Spirit. I'm gonna swing it over and have it go right between Kaladin and myself and give him two of the 2d6s. So I'll just do that right off the bat. That's nine hit points, so you're back up. And then as my action, I will...
Zariel Torgan 02:39:41 Let's see, what do I have left? I'll hit it with a Flaming Sphere again. That's going to be a dex 15. It takes 9 fire damage.
Dungeon Master 02:40:06 Almost good for the six. All right. Okay, end of your turn. It'll do its last legendary action. Take a swipe at Leopold.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:23 And I think that's all I got.
Dungeon Master 02:40:38 It'll be disadvantaged because it just took fire damage. But it hits any, I mean it misses anyway. Yeah. Top of the round Leopold. It's looking really hurt. There's a chance you guys finish it this round. You were the only silver to hit. So no one silver hits this round.
Leopold Magnus 02:40:57 Say, you hideous beast! What's that? No silvered hits this round? Damn. Yeah, so the next round he'll heal if I don't hit him. Yeah, you guys, uh...
Kaladen Shash 02:41:08 He did it well, Zari. I thought Leopold had it at the top of his last. That's why we didn't, yeah. Right.
Dungeon Master 02:41:14 Yeah, Leopold goes, and then Leopold goes, and then everybody in between. So Leopold, if nobody else does it, has to be the first one to do it.
Leopold Magnus 02:41:27 been missing. OK, yeah. So then I guess I'll use my bonus action to silver my sword. And I will roll to hit. 28. 28 makes a connection.
Kaladen Shash 02:41:38 Is that what you call it? Yes! Yes! Well Sapphire Damage, that is such a good 1-2 combo with this enemy.
Dungeon Master 02:41:50 Come on. 28 ahead. Very nice.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:52 Nice. Get him. Get him. Get him. Damn.
Leopold Magnus 02:41:58 So 11 damage there. Yep, plus another three. Yeah, 14 total damage on the sword. And I used my bonus action to silver it, so that's my turn.
Dungeon Master 02:42:19 Looking very hurt. Start of its round. Does it get the bite? No, it does not. We're going to take two easy pot shots, one at Kaladin, one at Zariel. It has disadvantage on the first one. First one misses anyway, so it doesn't matter.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:37 Bring it. With my ring that doesn't show up on my stats of an additional
Dungeon Master 02:42:48 Let's see if I wasted crypto. No, I don't. OK. And then Zariel, straight at you. 21 to hit. Even plus one.
Kaladen Shash 02:42:58 It's a piece of. In your in your. In OK. Great.
Zariel Torgan 02:43:09 Well, my shield shows up on the stats. Yeah. But with my ring of giant, huge fighting, it brings me to a 22. I used to be a 19 to a 20 with that whole setup, but I went back and I changed over my Warforged when we were doing something else. And so I haven't
Dungeon Master 02:43:19 Gosh, I missed this there then. You know, most D&D players have like a 15 to 17 AC average. Just putting that in there.
Kaladen Shash 02:43:28 Okay. I love this War 4 Wizard show. This is the best. They're so hard to hit.
Zariel Torgan 02:43:42 Yeah, this is insane. Yeah, it's ridiculous. This poor wolf.
Dungeon Master 02:43:54 Uh, Caledon your turn.
Kaladen Shash 02:43:58 Um. I will. Hit him with something else to him. I'll.
Kaladen Shash 02:44:32 All Misty step to get a little distance, so bonus action. Move just out of the way. And then I will cast. Chromatic orb at my second level. For dirty 20. And 22 fire damage.
Zariel Torgan 02:44:54 Nice. Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:44:54 It's very nice. Righty. And then see, does it make contact?
Dungeon Master 02:45:23 So you see Zaryel as it like, is getting pummeled with all these attacks. It goes up onto its back two legs, frantic, bloody, joints exposed, use muscle and sinew, and just profusely bleeding. Gets up, rears up, goes to take a big swipe at you, and then this beam of what kind of energy shoots at it. Taldon? Yeah, what was your attack?
Kaladen Shash 02:45:33 What's from my attack is everything No, that was that was those fire. That was a chromatic orb, but it was like a fire fireball
Dungeon Master 02:45:57 You see this explosion of fire energy just impact at the chest and throw it back into the wall one last time. The form hits the wall and you hear the yelp of just dogs as it hits the ground and the form, monstrous and distorted and exaggerated, sort of shrivels up slowly as the creature passes, going from this huge lycanthrope to you see just like a regular direwolf. This creature doesn't
Dungeon Master 02:46:28 turn into a person for some reason it turns to just a woven shape we'll say it's this one yeah and it's just left with this unconscious you see at the bottom of you guys directly south of your characters there are two of these like woven pups
Dungeon Master 02:46:57 sort of huddled against the wall like almost shaking but not quite but you know a very young dog thing where it's just like this is when downhill for them bad and they're kind of just expecting things to end pretty quickly but you guys uh have effectively ended combat you do hear with all of the commotion and everything going on that outside of like this little um like isolated room there's a lot of
Dungeon Master 02:47:26 like werewolves and stuff out there that have taken notice, but you don't see anything seems to be coming in. It took silver damage on this round. It's dead.
Kaladen Shash 02:47:39 Uhm? And we don't notice any other out and is the is the werewolf dead or do we need to do one last silver attack to kill it? OK, right. Is there any other exit? Do we see any other? Any other tunnel out?
Dungeon Master 02:48:00 Not in this room that you can tell. Give me an investigation as you're looking around this room. 16 doesn't take a whole lot as you're like looking through this room. You weren't noticing it at first because of.
Kaladen Shash 02:48:12 soon.
Dungeon Master 02:48:20 what had been going on, but with the large shapes sort of shriveled down, you see a lot of bodies, just sort of old, new, some just skeleton remains, some just like cloth tatters that are blood soaked or laying around, but you can sort of filter through it and you find, you know, a sum of money, about 150 gold or so in total between all of the bodies.
Zariel Torgan 02:48:42 Oh. Nice. Yeah, I think if we have the chance, be ready to run at any minute. But yeah, let's see if we can't get a short rest in.
Kaladen Shash 02:48:45 All right. Take a short rest and then continue on.
Leopold Magnus 02:49:12 Yes, that one took it out of me. I would go for a quick sip of a frosty cold one and some campfire time. And I will conjure a bonfire in between us.
Dungeon Master 02:49:34 And burn, Zaryel, again. Take your long rest. Count on that spot on your arm. Oh, sorry, short rest. Count on that spot on your arm. In the firelight, you can see black vasculature sort of spreading out from the bite wound, pulsating on the inside. You can feel something taking root.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:37 Eh, eh, eh
Leopold Magnus 02:49:47 Taking a long rest. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:50:05 Uh, I am going to. Uh. I'm gonna. I'm just gonna take the sword. And I'm gonna. I'm gonna how far down my arm do I feel the sensation?
Dungeon Master 02:50:05 Zariel, you still have the sensation in your body just deeply rooted. You want to talk like mechanics or do cool stuff?
Zariel Torgan 02:50:14 It's probably nothing.
Leopold Magnus 02:50:17 Ah, sorry.
Kaladen Shash 02:50:34 Now I wanna cut my arm off and I'm already attuned to the prosthetic potion. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:50:38 and
Zariel Torgan 02:50:42 Let's do it. Send all my dice mojo your way.
Dungeon Master 02:51:04 You guys see as Kaladin, you guys are all sitting sort of like in a triangle around this bonfire and in the firelight his arms sort of pulsates and you can see it tensing and the muscle constricting and almost pulling over itself at certain parts as his body is like forcing a change to that point.
Dungeon Master 02:51:25 uh it would you guys had slept into like the late morning did uh you know trek back out there slow pace through the cavern took some time to grind up more silver had this big encounter and now we're taking another hour to rest it is verging on evening and you feel the pull of the full moon though you cannot see it beaming in the sky cowl in your arm
Dungeon Master 02:51:52 really trying in this moment, having been bit by one of the lead werewolves of this den. It seems much more concentrated and powerful. You automatically crit on yourself. I'm going to say you take yourself to 1 HP. Fire instantly cauterizes. Where in the arm do you want to cut it off at?
Kaladen Shash 02:52:10 Okay. It will say it will be just above the elbow.
Dungeon Master 02:52:21 You put the sword sort of tucked underneath at your bicep in your sort of like serratus interior and you have the blade flat and you almost just pull the sword. You push the sword as hard out as you pull your arm inward and you just cut your arm free. Give me an arcana check. If they want to help you, they can. It's going to be a DC 25 and you do it with advantage.
Zariel Torgan 02:52:40 Guidance. Yeah, I'll give guidance.
Leopold Magnus 02:52:55 I'll assist if that's helpful. I can cast Burning Hands on his open wound to really cauterize it.
Dungeon Master 02:52:58 He's already got advantage. Is there anything else he can do? Will he pull anything? OK, well, I'll lower the DC to 22 then.
Kaladen Shash 02:52:58 So let's... It's okay, here we go.
Zariel Torgan 02:53:22 So advantage plus four.
Kaladen Shash 02:53:29 Oh, let me. I don't know why I can't get the it's not I want. Oh, did it not show up? It's at. Yeah, so with advantage it's 21 and if I roll a D4 from guidance to 22 like I can't miss and said roll the D4.
Dungeon Master 02:53:38 Even though it's not going through, at being, do any of them pass? No. Oh, yeah. I can't see the results. So yeah, you make it. You see, as he cuts off his arm. Maybe it's just my page space. I'm already loaded.
Zariel Torgan 02:53:55 Nice. That's not showing me either.
Kaladen Shash 02:53:59 with T401.
Dungeon Master 02:54:06 Okay, cool. Oh, there it is. It came through. You cut off your arm, the flame of your, well, I guess your sword doesn't do flames, so I just didn't see it. You cut it off, and it goes to just spurt blood and gout it onto the ground before Leopold sort of burning hands one of his gauntlet with the other, and then he presses his gauntlet into your stub, searing it and stopping all the bleeding as you feel Zariel sort of clutching your shoulder on the other side.
Dungeon Master 02:54:35 giving you just the pressure of distraction. You wait a beat, you don't feel anything, nothing. And then after a few beats, you're pretty sure that you got it before it had spread too far. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:54:55 OK, because I was already attuned to the potion, it says if I drink it, a new limb will begin to shape itself. OK, I can go ahead and execute that. Rechain in my bag. Pull out the bottle.
Zariel Torgan 02:54:55 Pretty metal.
Dungeon Master 02:55:11 pull out the bottle, pop the cork, drink it. As you look at your arm to see if anything happens, you see the tiniest little, we're talking less than a centimeter by a centimeter, green little vine sprouts at the very top of the nub. Is this your dominant arm or your non-dominant arm?
Kaladen Shash 02:55:25 Perfect. It's my left arm, so we'll say it's my non-dominant arm.
Zariel Torgan 02:55:28 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:55:49 OK, guys. That's a good beat to stop at. Especially because it's 1120. Good fight. Drag out brawl.
Kaladen Shash 02:56:01 Well, that was well played out we got. Or should we level up? So you can. Can we plan out the long rest since I said?
Zariel Torgan 02:56:04 Yeah We level up Yeah We
Leopold Magnus 02:56:11 That's tough. Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:56:17 If you got to get a long rest in, then you'll level up. I didn't want to level you up without Travis. Yeah, you can plan what you're going to do when you get a long rest, but you just got a short rest and you're still in the den technically. And you know that this was a large werewolf, but this wasn't the same one you saw before, so you don't really know the urgency.
Kaladen Shash 02:56:39 All right, we're going to get out, OK? Yeah. Well, I guess I should roll some hit dice.
Zariel Torgan 02:56:41 Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah, I already rolled mine. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:56:47 But you were so hurt that it was like, no, we have to take an hour to chill and wrap our wounds.
Leopold Magnus 02:57:04 Yeah. For the short rest. Yeah, I did mine as well. Yeah, that was that was badass. That was a really hard fight. That's true.
Zariel Torgan 02:57:11 Sweet. Well, good job, guys. Went better? Yeah, but now that we've killed it, we don't have to worry about them murking us.
Dungeon Master 02:57:19 You guys, you made it significantly harder for yourselves by closing off the space. You were always in reach. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:57:43 But I don't know, maybe they wouldn't have. Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:57:46 But they were always just going to be a layer action if you were too close to the wall. Out of game discussion, but I could see the concern. You made it. Hard fought, only a couple downs overall.
Leopold Magnus 02:58:01 Oh, we made it. So. Yeah. That's a shame I still defender just got obliterated right in the beginning.
Kaladen Shash 02:58:12 Oh, that went surprisingly well. The silver and then having nine wolves to distract it for three or four rounds was helpful.
Zariel Torgan 02:58:16 Yeah, that was awesome. Yeah. Yeah, that, that...
Dungeon Master 02:58:17 The silver makes a huge difference. Yeah, I absolutely decimated the still defender, got a good hit off on you, and then just rolled so low for most of it until it was like my turn to hit Jesse, and then I would crit, and then I'd go back to hitting nothing.
Kaladen Shash 02:58:43 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:58:45 Make my way through the characters. Trittle and Jessie, go back through. No. Guys, this AC is so high, I have to pick some stronger monsters.
Leopold Magnus 02:58:48 Yeah. Well, I mean, if you had hit me again, I would have gone down almost immediately. So probably best not to. Yeah, that's not a bad idea, but I'm just glass cannon.
Leopold Magnus 02:59:20 I'm pretty much all Yeah, but I can only take one maybe two big hits and then I'm toast Yeah, yeah Just cuz I haven't been hit
Kaladen Shash 02:59:20 You're a glass scanner. You're you're got a 21 AC 2026. Loaded up. I think you're holding on pretty good at 53. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:59:21 I mean, sort of, you're not super far behind the party. I would say, I think Leopold goes down the least amount of anybody.
Zariel Torgan 02:59:41 We doing? Yeah, yeah, that was awesome. Do we think of Tuesday?
Leopold Magnus 02:59:48 I guess I can regen a spell slot on a short rest, right? Nice, I will use that. But yeah, that was awesome. Absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:59:52 Yeah, arcane recovery. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:59:52 Thanks for running that, man. Yeah, next week. Oh, that's. I forgot their Thanksgiving week, but should be just fine.
Leopold Magnus 03:00:13 Yeah, we shouldn't leave until Wednesday night, so yeah, Tuesday works if it works for you guys. Right on. Yeah, good game, good game. Later, see ya.
Zariel Torgan 03:00:20 Alright, well, I'm gonna hop off, but it was a good game guys. Alright, sweet guys, bye.
Dungeon Master 03:00:22 Awesome. Yeah, thanks guys.
Kaladen Shash 03:00:28 All right, later guys.

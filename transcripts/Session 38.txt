Dungeon Master 00:00:00 checked hard and eventually got to the point where you got into, um, um, the first thing was the merchant. You ran into a merchant who ended up being a, um, small goblin with a huge backpack, claiming to be the estranged son of Goose III. Um,
Barrow Berkshire 00:00:01 pay $200. Honestly, they should hire me. Obviously, I don't want to be fired. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:00:26 Travis mic for a second.
Dungeon Master 00:00:29 You guys talked. You really didn't pay too much mind. That's probably just how it works with Goblin. And you each gave something, a diamond, to Gooch for a chance at a magic item. Everybody got something a little bit different. I don't even remember all of them. There are so many. There's the Ring of Fire Detection.
Gooch III 00:00:31 It's just.
Barrow Berkshire 00:00:31 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:00:53 which I think Tortimus got. There was the big thing, the deck of many things that Gooch got. Leah Barrow got the Axe of Returning. And then I don't remember the other two off the top of my head. Oh, the coconuts and the orb. That's right.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:00:55 Oh, yeah. Okay.
Karak 00:01:08 i got that i got the sphere next cut down yeah i absolutely forgot about the coconuts i'm excited
Alabaster Leatherback 00:01:13 Coconuts. Yeah. Yeah.
Gooch III 00:01:19 Orb of annihilation. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:01:23 It's like a grenade of annihilation, really. You carried on. You kept going. I think at that point you guys elected for a long rest. And then in your next day's travel, multiple successful checks. Eventually you had an encounter check that resulted in you fighting three sort of
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:01:30 you you
Dungeon Master 00:01:47 very personality driven bandits who had own little mini stories and back, um, backstories of, of who they are and why were they there. And it was so weird. And between the elf and the snake with a gun and a hat on, and I'm sure there was, there was one other, there's a bug. Um, I think there was something, um,
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:02:05 You did mention that.
Barrow Berkshire 00:02:13 A snake with a hat on. They're still on the map.
Dungeon Master 00:02:17 It was all random as hell, which made it way more fun. Yes, that's right. I think I deleted that one.
Gooch III 00:02:25 Did I mention that I wanted his gun? The little gun. I don't want the big gun. Let me check. Yeah, I don't show it on there, but anyway, go ahead. I just, go ahead, sorry.
Karak 00:02:31 The small one, yes. I remember this. I think you have it in your inventory. When you clarified it, it wasn't the sniper rifle.
Dungeon Master 00:02:47 Anyway, you have a gun. No, you do have it, because I said you could grab it, because it was a D8 damage modifier. And you, in this fight, at a very dire moment for Alabaster,
Barrow Berkshire 00:02:51 Now that's important, Jackson. Don't say sorry.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:02:55 Okay.
Gooch III 00:03:05 Mmm.
Dungeon Master 00:03:11 Gooch pulled a card, his second card, the first one being the Sage card, but it didn't manifest, so this was the first one that had effects, drawing the throne, giving him an increase in a wisdom-based skill and sudden ownership and deed to a mansion filled with monsters somewhere in the world. Frustrated, he pulled another card, and Gooch instantly disappeared.
Barrow Berkshire 00:03:37 I forgot about that.
Dungeon Master 00:03:37 teleported to a different realm that he did not remember um it like some sort of smoky obscured like anvil and forge room no figures that he could tell um panicking in there well not panicking strategically planning he pulled five cards um which were uh uriel which recap um
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:03:55 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:04:06 Gooch is cursed. He has a minus two to saving throws until it is removed by a god or the fate's curse. You got Jester, which is you gain advantage on d20 rolls for 72 hours, or you draw two extra cards beyond the number. Gooch chose to draw two more cards.
Barrow Berkshire 00:04:19 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:04:34 He then drew the Star card, which increases one of his ability scores by two to a max of 24. He then pulled the Challenge card, in which every magical thing on his person disintegrated, except the deck of three things.
Karak 00:04:38 That was ridiculous.
Dungeon Master 00:04:57 He pulled the Knight card, in which case Gooch IV appeared directly next to him. You pulled the Sun card, which gave you back your Magical Dagger, and you get 10 temporary HP daily at dawn until you die.
Dungeon Master 00:05:23 And finally, you pulled the moon card in which you get one to three wishes in which Gooch pulled three. I don't remember what you used your first wish on. I forget that, but you used the second wish to get out, correct? So the first was to go back.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:05:33 What a roller coaster. The first is to go back.
Barrow Berkshire 00:05:34 whoa i mean all in all pretty good you
Gooch III 00:05:48 So I wish, yeah, one to go back and then the next one was to heal Alabaster. Yeah. Yeah. Sweet. Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:05:53 You healed the party. You cast heal. That was right. Yeah. You did like the mass heal, so everybody went to full. Because it replicates to a 9th level spell, so you hit that. Yes, and that was the next thing I said. Because he used the wish on it, you all shed your point of exhaustion if you had it. So, Gooch's second wish puts you fully on track to start.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:06:03 Which means we don't have the long rest, right? Because we're rejuvenated.
Barrow Berkshire 00:06:08 Because I'm afraid of exhaustion.
Karak 00:06:14 Sweet.
Dungeon Master 00:06:26 Now, with Gooch there, the first thing I'll say as we establish it is you're still holding the cards in your hand. The distinction is that everybody looking at the deck would see 22 cards, and Gooch, you only see when you look at it 12.
Gooch III 00:06:47 Have we talked since I came back? Did I explain anything? Yeah. I was super helpful. Fucking con.
Dungeon Master 00:06:55 You cast heal, and then, well, the party finished out the fight. Well, they finished it out kind of while you were gone. Well, that's what happens when you pull the deck. But I ended it right at you guys killing that sort of sniper, Aladrin, who had been taking you out one by one from the tall cliff. So you're still in the Badlands. You can be up or down if you want.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:07:07 I think we just got bewildered that you appeared back out of nowhere. Yeah.
Barrow Berkshire 00:07:09 Yeah, me too.
Gooch III 00:07:17 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:07:21 Up to you. You will have looted them. You'll find, I'll say, you get three regular healing potions. There's one greater healing potion and one superior healing potion to be divvied up. It's not going to matter because gold won't come into play, but there is 100 gold between all of them.
Karak 00:07:46 you
Dungeon Master 00:07:49 And then you just find various supplies. So like basic things that, you know, adventures have, ball bearings, torches, sleeping bags, shit like that. Great. Your pants fall down. I left it.
Barrow Berkshire 00:08:00 I take all the ball bearings. I fill my pockets. Fuck. My fucking belt, dude. I left it. A kind of adventurist here.
Gooch III 00:08:02 Mm hmm.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:08:15 Ball bearings, what else? What other kind of things, Jonathan? You said there's ball bearings and other odds and ends? Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:08:20 Which part? Random adventuring shit. Torches, pythons, you know, whatever you would expect to be in the adventuring shit. Yeah, for sure. There are multiple flasks between their party and... Roll me a D20 roll.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:08:34 Do these fuckers have any booze? Oh, sick. I need it to be whiskey. It needs to be hot.
Barrow Berkshire 00:08:45 They don't have any beer? I want a shot of beer. OK. Perfect. It's going to give me a fucking headache, dude. This isn't even theirs. It's been here for years.
Dungeon Master 00:09:02 there's a half bottle of rosé underneath a bush the whole time
Karak 00:09:11 Ha ha ha.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:09:15 Fuck, I'll take it if you don't want it. I'm eyeballing it hard in his hand. My really long tortoise fingernails are just trying to grab it.
Barrow Berkshire 00:09:27 No, I'll just hold on to it. No, I give it to you. You have to go to the podiatrist to cut your fucking... Yeah, you know what I'm talking about, Brent.
Dungeon Master 00:09:40 There's like a clanking sound as you're trying to grip it.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:09:42 It's amazing I can even hold on to a smooth glass bottle. Dude, we've been on a journey. I haven't had time to cut my nails. Barrow, feed me this rosé. All right.
Karak 00:09:51 Oh.
Barrow Berkshire 00:09:57 I don't know if you have the rules to cut your nails, to be honest. Those things are thick. I'd pour it in his gullet, and that's when we can start. Holy shit, no wonder you guys choke and die. Okay.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:10:12 I eat the bottle as well. I'm like, what are you talking about? I'm so itchy where the six-pack plastic is.
Dungeon Master 00:10:15 I guess Snapping Turtle. I decided what your six-pack thing did. If you use two actions or two attack actions, if you had two attacks, to grapple the same creature and succeed on both, you can trap them in a plastic
Dungeon Master 00:10:45 be your channel third what are those but um cletus not cletus that's what this is what's great tortimus has like the can rings that you get when you buy six packs around his neck is like his character
Karak 00:10:47 it's funny oh it's rad like they're they're they're tied i love that
Alabaster Leatherback 00:10:47 What? Oh.
Barrow Berkshire 00:10:48 That's awesome. Somebody's got to have a choker.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:10:51 It's like a superior grapple. I'm looking up the scientific. It's just called a six pack ring, I guess.
Gooch III 00:11:11 Ha ha ha ha.
Barrow Berkshire 00:11:16 There's no Latin name for a stick back holder. There's like barnacles on it. So Goose the fourth is here now?
Dungeon Master 00:11:16 There should be. Yeah.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:11:22 Hey, it's basically a living creature now too. It's been on me for a long time. You could say I've grown attached to it. Sorry. I'm just going to apologize. Yeah. Side note.
Karak 00:11:40 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:11:46 You see Gooch the Third screaming awkwardly behind Zario. Sorry, not Zario. It just says it on the screen. It's fucking me. Gooch the Third. Sorry, what?
Barrow Berkshire 00:11:46 Who the hell is that guy? Wait, is it the same guy that you got the deck of many things from? Because we like nicknamed that guy Goose the fourth. Okay.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:11:47 You still have that bag?
Gooch III 00:11:57 Yeah, I'm just gonna... While everybody's off... It's my name, yeah. I'm gonna be like... While everybody's attention is away, I'm gonna go over and be like... Hey, you got those diamonds? Well, you know...
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:12:05 No, we didn't nickname him is.
Karak 00:12:15 I love that.
Barrow Berkshire 00:12:21 One by one.
Dungeon Master 00:12:23 What the fuck do you want with my diamond? Give me back my fucking cards. Deal. Gooch the fourth pulls a card from the deck of many things.
Gooch III 00:12:28 I mean, you know. I'll give you one card for the diamonds. For one diamond, yeah. If I lose him...
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:12:39 He's trying to resell the cards to the person who bought them from. He just dies.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:12:46 Art of the deal.
Dungeon Master 00:12:53 I swear to God, if I die right now, I have the void card. 24. He gets the jester card. The jester one is the same as it. He gets advantage of all of his roll. Oh, he's going to pick two more cards, actually, instead.
Karak 00:13:04 It's that card. What kind of debuff is coming? All right. Yeah.
Barrow Berkshire 00:13:04 That feels bad. Wait, so we took that one and that one didn't happen. Can you just take two? I don't understand.
Gooch III 00:13:21 All right. Hey. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, I said one. One card.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:13:21 They're just yoinking us cards. That's got gnarly sleight of hand.
Dungeon Master 00:13:23 it's it's you get advantage and all you do 20 rolls for three days or you draw two more cards without like the penalty of it so he pulled two more cards instead he got a 33 um which is the ninth card
Barrow Berkshire 00:13:35 Oh, okay. That's a double lift. No way. Who's to fit?
Gooch III 00:13:51 It's Gooch the Fifth. Oh.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:13:54 Oh, my God.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:13:55 It's just an actual baby. Grandpa.
Dungeon Master 00:13:55 You see an even smaller goblin with an even bigger backpack. He's slightly purple in hue and he's already balding. You see Gooch II, your father.
Karak 00:13:56 There's minions. There's minions. Oh. Uh-oh.
Barrow Berkshire 00:14:05 Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:14:16 He's got a cane in his hand and he's really hunched over. He's a small, frail frame. He goes, what am I doing here? Gooch IV draws another die. Keep going.
Karak 00:14:27 Use those diamonds.
Gooch III 00:14:28 Oh, well, uh... Well, uh... Hmm. Oh, well, uh... Hmm. Uh... This is terrible. Dad, I'm working!
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:14:39 Like father, like son, I guess.
Dungeon Master 00:14:46 This is part of his other roll. He got the sun card, which means he gets a magical item and 10 extra hit points every day until he dies. We're not rolling any of the bad ones. Everybody's sort of talking.
Barrow Berkshire 00:15:02 Just buff to hell. Thank you.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:15:05 What item does he get? What is this a family reunion?
Gooch III 00:15:08 The Gucci's are a strong people.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:15:11 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:15:16 And right behind you, you hear Gooch the third and Gooch the fourth are talking. And then you hear like a and you turn around and there's a third goblin and they're kind of in a little circle talking to each other. And you guys are kind of on the outside, close enough to hear everything, but they're not addressing you.
Barrow Berkshire 00:15:35 I turned to Carrick and I said, Gooch told me his dad was dead. Who the fuck is this guy? He told me that while we were training. Yeah, it's like the picture he has in his wallet. Looks just fucking like him. What?
Gooch III 00:15:41 You're done. Picture your dad in your wallet. Hey, uh, no big deal. I just
Karak 00:15:45 I don't know. I don't know, man. It looks a lot like him, though. Hey, Gooch, what is going on over here?
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:15:50 Most people only have one Gooch, but we have three.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:15:56 How many of these goochers are there?
Dungeon Master 00:15:57 It's really no big deal. We don't know what's going on. Where am I? I was in hell.
Gooch III 00:16:12 Who to help? Yep, we're all single fathers. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Barrow Berkshire 00:16:21 I lift my leg and look. My third one's on my neck. It's like laggy skin.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:16:27 For every gooch we acquire, we also acquire one on our body. Dude, that's wild. All right, let's stand around and look at the gooches for 72 hours.
Dungeon Master 00:16:33 Which one?
Karak 00:16:35 Oh.
Gooch III 00:16:42 That's the rest of the challenge.
Barrow Berkshire 00:16:52 Perfect. Can you stay still and just do bits? The first one's the second. We should have Gooch the second pull a knight card.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:16:54 I'm going to walk up to Gooch the first and ask him what he's got in his pack. The first. Oh, the second. Second, sorry. I'm losing track. I'm going to ask Gooch the second what he's got in his bag.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:17:07 Here, that's the second. Yeah. Pull a 33.
Dungeon Master 00:17:07 Gooch the fourth. Gooch the second, yeah. You can't keep up with this. You see his eyes barely lift as he addresses you. He goes, I have a backpack on. Turns and it turns with him. He doesn't see it. He goes back and goes, I never trusted you. Typed.
Karak 00:17:19 you you
Gooch III 00:17:35 Oh, he's just racist. I'm going to run over and smack you. Smack you on the knee. Be like, hey, hey, leave him alone. That's my dad.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:17:36 I'm just going to pick him up. I'm going to turn him upside down. I'm going to start shaking until stuff starts falling out of his bag.
Barrow Berkshire 00:17:37 Hey, what the hell was that? I hold my shirt up to catch it all. I pass out.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:17:38 Oh my God.
Dungeon Master 00:17:44 It's all common ass shit. There's not a single magical thing on it, for instance. You get hit in the head with a shovel. Who am I? Who is that?
Alabaster Leatherback 00:18:03 Who is this? This is your father? Well, this is not any place for a retiree. This is an adventure. Dear God. Then I'll set him down. I'll pat him a bit, dust him off with my trunk.
Gooch III 00:18:05 He was in a retirement home, okay? Be nice to him. It's all right.
Dungeon Master 00:18:17 I was dead and I was in hell. There is my God. You can try all you need to figure it out. He goes, finally a man with manners. And he kind of gets over and he starts licking it up off the ground with no shame at all.
Karak 00:18:21 I don't know.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:18:29 Dude, you might need this more than me. I throw up the Verze. I forgot I drank it. Oh, no. Oh, my God. I guess he did need it. His legs are so straight.
Dungeon Master 00:18:47 In fact, no, no. He goes to the ground from standing, so he's sort of like in a pyramid-type pose, and you just see a lot of ass crack as he licks up the rosé off the ground. The licks are so sick.
Gooch III 00:18:57 Let's crawl. I'll show you the house. Come on. And I'm going to go crawl into Tortimus. We each get an opening. An arm or a leg. Car with me.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:18:57 Oh, God.
Karak 00:19:00 Dude, your dad's fucked up, man.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:19:04 Okay, that's foul. Oh no. Holy, holy fuck. I really do have three goochies. Jesus. Okay, let's keep on our journey.
Barrow Berkshire 00:19:25 Oh, my God.
Gooch III 00:19:30 Yeah, let's go. The gang's all here.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:19:32 I'm gonna start rolling away with my gooch squad. There it is. Wait. Everyone, you need to put... I look in my shell. You have to put on helmets. You guys are gonna hit your heads really hard on each other. Not a gentle ride with three of you in there. What?
Karak 00:19:35 you you
Dungeon Master 00:19:49 Gooch the fourth says you are my helmet and he just kind of like stiffens up in there not giving you a lot of room so anyway this parade continues
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:20:01 He takes up so much room when there's a tiny goblin body. I can't believe that. A goblin army.
Gooch III 00:20:05 Yeah.
Barrow Berkshire 00:20:08 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:20:18 It has been two full days, I believe. This is like the end of the second day. So you guys can keep going, I guess. You do have full health, full rest, nothing expended. It is like getting into the evening at this point. End of the second full day. But you guys, I believe, are two days ahead. You have four days of progress of your nine days total. So five days left. You have to make up.
Dungeon Master 00:20:49 in the span of seven days. That's how it needs to be set. If you continue to use the coconuts, you'll get there days in advance. Rex, that's just quiet enough that I didn't pick up anything at all, so I just saw the motion. I just saw...
Gooch III 00:20:53 And we're using the coconuts, right? It's definitely not me.
Barrow Berkshire 00:21:00 Even faster. Are you cracking pepper over there? You put lotion on his hand to crack pepper.
Karak 00:21:02 stuff to have a good nev you
Alabaster Leatherback 00:21:02 Yeah. Oh. Oh yeah, I'm I'm I'm knocking nuts coconuts.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:21:04 Yeah. Nope. Jesus.
Dungeon Master 00:21:24 So how it'll work, it'll just do... Everybody's going to make their survival check, so six checks. We're looking for three successes before three failures. And whatever order you guys would like. Yep. Tortimus succeeds on his.
Gooch III 00:21:25 Yes, yes.
Karak 00:21:45 That was a survival. Double win.
Dungeon Master 00:21:54 Gooch fails. Correct? Correct. That's true. No. It's still a failure in Gooch. But the Nat 20, 25, and 17 are four successes because the Nat 20 is two in itself. So beautiful. You guys get there.
Gooch III 00:21:56 I have advantage. I failed.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:22:00 Do the other fellow gooches get to roll? Damn.
Barrow Berkshire 00:22:08 We want to actually
Dungeon Master 00:22:23 This will just be a general thing. When you guys get to the Tree of Death in the Faerom, so we'll get back to the larger map, what is the pacing? How many points of exhaustion do you want to show up to the next location with?
Barrow Berkshire 00:22:44 I mean, zero. Yeah, we have a solid buffer.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:22:46 I mean, we have the clickety quacks. It should be okay. We can definitely catch some Zs.
Karak 00:22:48 like one again or zero. I mean, if one is what we've been traveling at, right. Or we acquired one in two days. Yeah.
Gooch III 00:22:58 So we're two days ahead. And with the coconuts, we should be able to make that if we still rest, right? Or are we thinking...
Dungeon Master 00:23:10 As it stands, you guys are currently ahead of schedule. You have seven days to travel five days. You can just do multiple long rests in a row. In theory, you would be healthy enough in between each single one
Karak 00:23:23 Oh, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:23:30 that you could tackle anything you fought. Unless I cheated and gave away too hard of a monster, you guys would defeat the monsters in theory. You guys can take pace collecting XP or you can get through with a point of exhaustion and potentially beat out something that's going to happen. Mechanically speaking, over the table, you guys can get there and get the jump on something.
Dungeon Master 00:24:01 ahead of schedule or you guys can level up twice yes your current characters would level up twice so you would be stronger again so you'll either be strong and fight something on par or get there early and maybe be a little under prepared but have the element of surprise
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:24:09 hmm
Barrow Berkshire 00:24:10 Hmm. Yes.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:24:11 as a uh would that be as these characters then um jonathan is there any um i guess would would we have any knowledge of the fey wild obviously we've been here for a while is there any items or
Gooch III 00:24:15 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:24:34 What are you asking me? Like are you asking me for a specific magical item instead of leveling up?
Alabaster Leatherback 00:24:42 powerful quests that you could do maybe to unlock something special rather than just leveling straight up. I guess I personally...
Barrow Berkshire 00:24:59 Think for yourself, dude.
Gooch III 00:25:01 Well, I don't think we'd be able to give anything to our, our, our shells, right? Be fine.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:25:05 Yeah, because I guess I'd be more interested in that because then you could pass it on to whatever comes next than leveling up characters that we might not play. I don't know. Got it. Okay, so if we got some powerful item, that wouldn't necessarily matter.
Karak 00:25:18 Yes, sir.
Dungeon Master 00:25:20 Yeah, nothing with your current characters is going to the next thing but the characters. But in theory, right, this would be really chronic thinking. You could go for an item instead of a level up, and then when the party plays these characters, if it ever happens again, your character has something very powerful but is just a level behind. Interesting dynamic, but could be fun.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:25:45 Okay. Yeah, I didn't have anything particular in mind, but that would be more interesting. I think that would be kind of fun. Anyways, I'll leave it to the party to discuss.
Barrow Berkshire 00:25:58 I would probably, my vote would be for levels versus a jump.
Dungeon Master 00:26:02 okay then so what we'll do it as is anybody who wants to just sort of take the more straightforward gain your abilities with your character go for it alabaster you can take one level up
Gooch III 00:26:04 Yeah, I think so too.
Karak 00:26:06 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:26:24 And I don't know, talk with the party. I have nothing specific in mind. And I'm not going to tell you a powerful enough magic item that you could like break whatever comes next. But the party and you could discuss things together. And if somebody has an idea for something, I could like we could work together to get you a magic item or create one. Like what would the party want? What's the thing that you think you would go after to fill a hole in the party?
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:26:26 Get a keg.
Gooch III 00:26:48 That gun.
Barrow Berkshire 00:26:49 Ask for a beer, dude.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:26:51 I feel like we don't have a big healer role at the moment. I'm obviously a paladin. I have some heals, but I'm not necessarily heavy in the heals, so maybe something like that.
Dungeon Master 00:27:00 OK. And I like the way this could play out. There could be something on the way where, as a paladin, Alabaster would have knowledge of an item that existed at one point.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:27:19 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:27:21 And you guys could go out of your way to get it or Alabaster can leave and take like a detour and meet up, not getting a level, but having the item. And I have something, an idea of like an item already, unless you have something specific you want to propose. Okay. I think the lack of the healing in the party does make it difficult.
Barrow Berkshire 00:27:22 you you
Alabaster Leatherback 00:27:39 No, I didn't have anything necessarily specific in mind. So if you had something, yeah. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:27:49 And the more healing capability you guys have, the less punches I have to pull in each sort of fight scenario. Sometimes I pull too much and I get whomped and sometimes I don't pull hard enough and you guys get close to death. But what about Alabaster finds an elixir enough for the party that when you guys drink it, you gain the ability to once per turn
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:27:54 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:28:19 Use your bonus action to regain hit points equal to one minor healing potion. 2d4 plus two. Every turn, no limit. Like a legendary artifact that Alabaster finds. But again, the party's going to be two levels above you, and you'll be one level instead of two. So everybody gets a huge healing bonus. Alabaster's a little bit behind. Is that a fair trade?
Alabaster Leatherback 00:28:25 Oh, wow. Bonus action. Yeah. One level behind. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I'll do that.
Karak 00:28:27 Okay. Great.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:28:34 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:28:49 so everybody levels up twice you level up one okay okay i love it so as we so this will just be like a mechanic you guys remember basically like a table rule for the fey wild art and future ones on your turn you can sacrifice a bonus action to heal yourself one regular healing potions worth of healing
Alabaster Leatherback 00:29:19 have to be conscious for that though right can't be like knocked out cool you know maybe that'll that'll uh play into my near-death experience i had a i've had a vision i was so i was so close to uh
Dungeon Master 00:29:25 How about you don't have to be conscious? Because you sacrifice the level. You get a little bit extra. True. You were... Or was it Carrick? Who rolled the death save?
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:29:41 No. Barrel rolled one.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:29:47 What are the, uh, the, what about care? I was the only one that rolled a good death save. Uh, or wait, uh, Travis, Travis, Travis rolled the healing save. Yeah. Pick me up. Yeah. I think you picked, you picked me up.
Karak 00:29:53 I didn't roll with this. I win. I think I think I think I think I think Barrow is going to
Dungeon Master 00:29:59 Who is down, though? Yeah, I know Travis Farrow came to the table, but he was from Alabama. It was two failed death saves on two failed medicine checks. So it was like the people were hurting him who were trying to heal him.
Gooch III 00:30:04 Yeah. Yeah. And it was bad, too. It was close.
Barrow Berkshire 00:30:05 Yeah, I rolled a healing save, but I don't remember who I was picking up. Yeah. So, yeah. Yeah, we were fucking close.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:30:18 Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no, I feel like I was really in touch with the spirits at that moment. And it maybe connected me to that item. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:30:27 And he passed a con save that would have killed him outright. That was a good D&D moment. Hell yeah. OK. Get to leveling up, guys. We'll do hit points together.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:30:30 Like a nat one.
Karak 00:30:42 Right.
Gooch III 00:30:54 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:30:58 But yeah. Otherwise, some classes get more. I mean, you guys are all martial pretty much, right? Paladin, Rogue, Barbarian. Yeah. Yeah, 100%. This will be a little pretty cool. Yeah. Well, technically, it's multiple long rests.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:31:10 Yeah. Are we leveling up twice right now or once right now?
Barrow Berkshire 00:31:15 Ranger. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:31:25 But also in talking with Travis, he had said, and I, in this, like, I appreciate it. I asked him, well, it was everybody actually. It's just Jesse and Trace that didn't hear it. I was like asking how much filler you wanted. I was like, do you want one session of the Feywild or two? And that's when Travis made the comment about like, oh, I don't want it to end. I really like the character or end it now. So I don't have to like, you know,
Barrow Berkshire 00:31:53 Well, no, my point was if we're going to have to take three weeks off in a row or two or whatever, it doesn't make sense to do another one after. We're going to do 10.
Dungeon Master 00:31:54 keep going with it right it's like three yeah so this will be the finale of the Feywild arc and then you'll pick up with your characters
Karak 00:31:59 Yeah.
Gooch III 00:32:04 Yeah, that makes sense.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:32:09 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:32:15 So as you guys level up, you cross various regions of the Feywild. There are areas of large bioluminescent mushrooms that are like forest canopies that give off purple hues as you walk Forgotten Trails. There's grass that glows blue and green and fireflies and you see fairies and you hit other stretches of Badlands. You fight monsters and hyenas and
Dungeon Master 00:32:42 large centipede creatures and you guys carve your path along this destined trail carrying these figures of import you have your discussions the trail of gooch's keeps going um gooch the second doesn't get any more lucid but he is in theory a level four fighter the same as gooch the fourth um
Barrow Berkshire 00:33:03 Thank you.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:33:06 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:33:10 So you have two level, or they would be level six. You have two level six fighters in the party with you as they have traveled through this area. And you see, you travel along huge canyons and cliffs. You walk along sides, you know, just a shoulder width away.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:33:17 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:33:30 from a sheer drop off you climb into trees and cross canopies and you trudge through swamps and eventually you guys get to an area that you know used to be the source of power in the Feywild as you all hit this sort of bottom right corner towards the endless sea you enter the realm of the Eternal Court
Alabaster Leatherback 00:33:45 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:33:58 And you guys hit this precipice as you guys walk up and there is this enormous well. It's still built like a well where it's got like cinder blocks stacked in that rounded pattern that goes all the way around. And there's like a comically large sort of tower and little roof with a bucket hanging in the center. But you look down and quite literally is a sea of stars.
Dungeon Master 00:34:26 There is like it ebbs and flows in the well. And you look down and there's like definitely some sort of invisible layer, but you can sort of make out. It's a weird sort of non-visible sheer fabric that like separates the matter from the air. And you look in and you see twinkling stars, spiraling galaxies. And, you know, some hundred feet down, there seems to be like land masses gathering and going down.
Dungeon Master 00:34:56 And none of you have been here before because it's pretty taboo to travel to this area when the Feywild is deteriorating. Just nobody goes there. So you get that sense of hesitancy as you hit the precipice of this. But everybody give me a perception check as you hit this point.
Karak 00:35:19 I'm just getting my sheet open here. It said perception.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:35:20 Oh, did we do our health yet? Are we doing that later? I only have advantage on perception checks.
Dungeon Master 00:35:24 Nobody's rolled it yet, but we'll do it in a second. 22. Great. Oh, that's right. Yeah. Nine and seven and eight. You're not a wise character. You're a charismatic character.
Barrow Berkshire 00:35:24 Do you do it right now? I rolled mine, sorry. We can scroll up to see it. Yeah, I got Google.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:35:28 I also did mine. OK, you just rolled so good. I had eight total, and you beat that with a one.
Gooch III 00:35:45 Uh huh.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:35:54 Yeah, that's what I don't understand. Why do I have advantage on that? In in smell of in smell. Oh, I'm smelling.
Karak 00:35:57 Didn't see it. Yeah.
Barrow Berkshire 00:35:58 You're a fucking numbnuts, dude. You're absolutely a numbnuts. Smell like crazy.
Dungeon Master 00:36:02 something maybe elephant your trunk um 16 18 um it is the 20 and the 22 and i'll just house rule it right now uh
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:36:09 Have you seen the size of your nose, dude?
Dungeon Master 00:36:22 Gooch the fourth and Gooch the second will come into serious circumstances. If it's looking dire in the fight, they'll pop in with rolls and attacks. And if everybody really fails something super important, they'll chime in. Otherwise, they're there for the comical aspect of it. Okay.
Gooch III 00:36:40 Well, to be fair, one's my child and one's my elderly father, so... They're like the worst companions you could... Yeah. They already came with their own bags. Oh, yeah. Be a potion runner.
Barrow Berkshire 00:36:40 Hold the bags, dude. Just hold our shit while we fuck these guys up.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:36:40 Can we give them each? Can we give them each one of the regular potions to like get us back up if we die?
Alabaster Leatherback 00:36:45 Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:36:58 Yeah, you can give them each a potion as well as emergency standby. The 20 and the 22 are the ones who see it, well... Smell it and smell it. So... Gooch the second, you see... See it and smell it. You see on the ground as you... There's Balnor. As you get to the well, there are like...
Barrow Berkshire 00:37:17 Thank you.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:37:23 dude you've already been here
Dungeon Master 00:37:25 like a very characteristic split hoof print with a little back toe through the mud of the area that you instantly identify as being like swine in nature. It looks like a boar or pig hoof into the mud. You smell a lot of really powerful
Gooch III 00:37:31 Thank you.
Barrow Berkshire 00:37:48 No, I'm like super fat. They'd be way deeper.
Dungeon Master 00:37:56 what would be like alpha or head bore smell. Like these are large creatures who are used to being in charge and they kind of give off that odor of don't fuck with me. Um, you got a similar smell in your first run in with the three little pigs. Uh, so you know that with your guys's slower pace, they have beat you to this location potentially. Um, or they've been here in the past. Who knows? You,
Dungeon Master 00:38:27 sort of hesitate there with the both of you having succeeded, you can tell there's nothing in this immediate area laying for a trap. And you're looking in, you don't see anything immediately below that as a trap either. So it is just that you picked up that you are not the first people to travel through this area.
Gooch III 00:38:47 Huh.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:38:51 You mean the school where you were supposed to learn about archery except you for some reason didn't think that and then you didn't learn archery? That one?
Barrow Berkshire 00:38:51 I hope it's not my dad and my son. But who knows? No, I abandoned my litter when I went to school.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:38:56 Oh, Barrow, tell me more. You're not a family man? Cool, huh?
Dungeon Master 00:39:10 It's just,
Barrow Berkshire 00:39:19 All right, I don't need the fucking sass. I thought I was going to learn about fucking... I thought I was going to learn how to be a park ranger. I was going to fucking keep our trees safe. They gave me a sword and told me how to fucking fight. I will be reading the syllabus if I ever go back to school, but here I am. I have too many student loans to go back, so I'm pretty much fucked. I'm an adventurer now, and that's it.
Gooch III 00:39:23 Ugh.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:39:31 That's the Lorax's job and you know that. You don't need to do that. Barrow turned into like a sad divorced dad.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:39:46 All right, shape up. We need to take sense of this situation. This is serious work here.
Gooch III 00:39:53 Yeah, I just pushed...
Barrow Berkshire 00:39:55 I'm having a fucking moment, Alabaster. I'm talking about abandoning my kids and you're telling me to fucking move on. You're just like my professors, dude. Thanks, man. Thanks, man. I take it.
Karak 00:39:58 And you're always in such a, always in such a hurry.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:40:07 All right, dude, I'm sorry I hand you my flask. I'm sorry, dude. I know that's a touchy subject. But you have to admit it's pretty funny that you went to archery school and you didn't learn it and you have crippling student debt because of it.
Barrow Berkshire 00:40:25 Raiders don't have to be archers, dude. You don't get it. You didn't go to my class.
Gooch III 00:40:34 Like, eh. Yeah. Eh. The whole time I'm trying to talk, my dad, Gooch II, just keeps trying to show me pictures from the family album. He's like, this is when you went off to school. Like, no, dad. I'm working. I'm working right now.
Dungeon Master 00:40:35 I think this whole time Gooch has been trying to talk too. He's like trying to pipe up in between and he can't say anything.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:40:41 He keeps putting the finger up. I can't hear you. You guys are echoing so loud in my shell. I'm trying to argue with Barrow here.
Karak 00:40:44 Thank you.
Gooch III 00:41:05 Alright, I'll pop out. I just see like... Hey, uh... Yeah, I'll scramble out. Uh, we should be careful. There's... Big pigs. Here? Yep. I'll crawl back inside.
Dungeon Master 00:41:06 We're in you still.
Barrow Berkshire 00:41:09 Get out. Yeah, most pigs are bad. I'm kind of the outlier.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:41:13 Thank you.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:41:25 Very astute, Gooch. He scrambles in. In me. In me, that is. Oh my goodness.
Dungeon Master 00:41:38 You should cramble in. Oh, the show. Oh, reroll ones on health.
Barrow Berkshire 00:41:39 Just horrible rolls. Super bad. That's better. Did everybody add their levels and stuff?
Gooch III 00:41:40 Yeah, I get back in. It's scary outside.
Karak 00:41:47 rotten rolls, dude. I'm just going to re-roll the one. That was better.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:41:53 Wait, yeah, you get the real one. All right, what's the scenery? Yeah. Were these footprint or hoof prints fresh-ish?
Alabaster Leatherback 00:41:56 Health we're doing that I added a level, but I need to add health
Barrow Berkshire 00:42:07 So we're square. Okay. I'd like to get in and fucking look for truffles in those footsteps.
Gooch III 00:42:11 Ouch.
Dungeon Master 00:42:21 Give me a nature check or a survival check if one is better than the other for you. Okay, go for it. You didn't have that. You had the two cards anyway. That's the one that you picked.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:42:32 Root around. Oh, I rolled off the 20.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:42:35 Damn, I got a really bad health roll.
Gooch III 00:42:39 I will help. Has it been more than 72 hours? I've been using that advantage. Oh, gotcha.
Barrow Berkshire 00:42:42 Fuck. Minor dives in.
Karak 00:42:48 You picked two cards.
Dungeon Master 00:42:53 14 and 14. Pretty middle of the road above average slightly. You can tell these are not within the first couple of days. So if you guys had hooked it here, you guys, no pun intended, would have run into them potentially. It's like way more likely, but it is old enough at this point that you can't get. It's not like you can't carbon date it right now. You don't know the exact time. Predates by at least a day or so.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:43:23 I've learned nothing. I take a swig. Alright. Never. I get better the drunker I get. For that is the entire basis of
Dungeon Master 00:43:28 How many swigs before Tortimus starts rolling with disadvantage? Never, just always on his... Drinking glasses.
Gooch III 00:43:39 Never. It's just kombucha. Just calling him out the whole time.
Karak 00:43:39 It's a buff. It's a buff, actually.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:43:49 my class unlike barrow i actually learned how to drink in my drinking class i hand him another i give you my flask again
Barrow Berkshire 00:44:02 Fuck you, dude. Fuck you. Just because you would decide that doesn't mean you know how to fucking drink better than I do. This is bullshit, dude.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:44:04 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:44:09 Tortimus was actually in an alcoholic class and, but Barrow is just drinking in like a water capturing class of like how to get fresh water in the jungle.
Gooch III 00:44:20 It's.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:44:24 Yeah. My family is like a really big kung fu family, and I just couldn't really get the hang of it. But then on a real late night of drinking, I started kicking around, and it worked really well. So here I am. What? No. No, I'm not. My family is. I was bad. Yeah, my cousin's pretty good.
Barrow Berkshire 00:44:40 Wait, you're a Kung Fu Turtle? What's your last name?
Dungeon Master 00:44:46 Yeah.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:44:54 His name's heard around. His name's Oogway. He's not quite a master, but he might be soon. He's stone cold sober. That's probably why. If he drinks, he might be a master. If we're going by my logic, yes. His logic, probably, definitely not.
Gooch III 00:45:06 Let's just.
Barrow Berkshire 00:45:09 Oh, so if you trace, you'd be better? Understood. This map is crazy. Did you make this?
Karak 00:45:18 Drunken Master.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:45:24 I shake out the last drop of my flask. This flask. I have so many flasks in my shell. Okay. Well, let's follow these tracks. Jesus.
Gooch III 00:45:40 I'm just licking Gooch the fourth's hair. Trying to groom him.
Dungeon Master 00:45:49 get the fuck off we've never been like that the other two simultaneously were like they get really offended by that what do you mean like gross to look at and they like start getting around your like ankles because they're so small yipping at you
Alabaster Leatherback 00:45:51 oh my god i thought that gooch was quite frankly disgusting but now there's three of them
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:45:56 That's crazy, dude. Like any of us, that would have made more sense because we're animals. But you're not. That was weird. Like chihuahuas. Kick them.
Karak 00:46:00 Well,
Gooch III 00:46:15 Hey, don't make my house mad.
Barrow Berkshire 00:46:19 Fucking naked mole rats are getting all over you. There you go.
Dungeon Master 00:46:29 Gooch the second. And you see he's like, you want to see naked? And he gets undressed and he's got really fat old man butt. And he's got like a little bit of a long tailbone. It sticks out longer than it should. And he like embraces your leg and tries to crawl up. Oh, sure.
Karak 00:46:33 Oh, God.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:46:44 gross wait who's legacy on alabaster okay wait aren't elephants aren't elephants like afraid of of rodents and mice
Gooch III 00:46:49 Oh. Oh, just like Christmas.
Barrow Berkshire 00:46:50 Yeah, good. That's what they say.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:46:54 These creatures are disgusting. Get off of me. And I pick them up with my trunk. Kind of set them down. I would hardly call this a rodent.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:47:10 A naked shriveled old man that looks like a naked moron. What's the size of his teeth? I know. I know. And stay away from my mini flasks.
Dungeon Master 00:47:16 They're goblins, remember. They're humanoid. You put a naked old goblin in your cell. Anyway.
Gooch III 00:47:22 I'm going to, as you set him down. Come on, dad. Let's go. Put him back in the shell. Yeah, let's go.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:47:29 Put that man back in the home. That's cruel what you've done to him.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:47:43 Let's follow these tracks. We're gonna be here forever if we don't just follow these tracks. I get in my shell and I stay for 72 hours.
Barrow Berkshire 00:47:46 We're going to make our DM do another session if you don't hurry up.
Dungeon Master 00:47:53 You go in the wall. You go in there, but instantly you find that Gooch II has really made himself at home here. He's putting out all of his collectibles. And while he's in your shell, you see he's standing like a dresser across the room. And he's fully naked still. And he goes, this is actually kind of uncomfortable.
Karak 00:47:53 Gooch, I'm not sure you should have invited your whole family, man.
Gooch III 00:48:05 Thank you.
Barrow Berkshire 00:48:15 Yeah.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:48:24 Dude, you were invited in here via virtue of a friend, and you're literally making yourself a home in my home. I guess that's fine. You can clean, just not me, I guess. Okay, anyways.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:48:24 He's moving in.
Dungeon Master 00:48:35 He grabs a broom and he starts to kick you out with it. A little light turns on from inside your shell. It's...
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:48:50 Let's continue. The Tortimus bits are going to go too far. Can we please go? I'm going to start rolling away after scooping all the douches.
Barrow Berkshire 00:48:55 He's like glowing.
Gooch III 00:49:01 Mm hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:49:03 From crashing from inside. As you guys jump in, presumably, you enter initially what is a free fall. You plunge through the barrier of the eternal court and you kind of hang in air as you lose momentum and your acceleration blows to nothing. And there is a sort of awkward moment where all of you are just sort of
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:49:25 There's no way it's me. Are we all dumb?
Dungeon Master 00:49:29 three floating in the same space as each other in the party, who has the highest intelligence? I feel like it's probably Gooch. Zero? Zero? Zero? Zero?
Karak 00:49:38 Not I. Oh, I'm negative one.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:49:40 Yeah, I don't think it's me. A negative one. We have a mission to do. There's nothing to think about here.
Gooch III 00:49:44 I have zero. You've heard the dialogue. Oh no.
Barrow Berkshire 00:49:55 How are you negative 100? That's hilarious. What are you? What is Carrick? Zero is the highest. I said zero.
Dungeon Master 00:50:04 of barbarians you guys don't know how to move you are stuck in space and you can't go anywhere
Alabaster Leatherback 00:50:10 Carry on, men.
Karak 00:50:12 oh my god I'm just trying to fly going nowhere
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:50:21 I start frantically flapping. Gooch the second is wise. Your relationship with your dad seems so good.
Gooch III 00:50:22 Wait, wait. My dad. My dad's smart. Yeah. Dad, help. Daddy, help me. Loading away.
Barrow Berkshire 00:50:27 Yeah, what are the dad and son? Roll a d20. The dad and the son. Okay, d12. Get a 12 for a plus one. He can barely speak.
Dungeon Master 00:50:36 is generous so Gooch the second has a negative two on his he's barely coherent Gooch the fourth has a four
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:50:57 Guys, I should have studied something more than whiskey in school.
Barrow Berkshire 00:50:59 Yeah, the dice don't lie. They really don't. I tried, dude. They gave me a sword instead. What?
Gooch III 00:51:00 Peace.
Dungeon Master 00:51:05 You guys are awkwardly stuck in this position. Hmm.
Karak 00:51:07 It was meant to fail. It was absolutely meant to fail.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:51:24 All right, shape up. Put some effort into it. And I'm going to try to like...
Gooch III 00:51:30 I have the sage thing. Could I meditate on how to move through here? Guys, I think I have it. I'm thinking. Yeah, you can see my brain just flexing with my heartbeat because I'm using it for the first time.
Dungeon Master 00:51:37 Yes. Boom, boom, boom, boom.
Barrow Berkshire 00:51:37 Just throw a bomb right behind you. Blow us forward. Nice.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:51:40 He put all two of his brain cells together. Your head's poked out of my neck hole. How old are you?
Dungeon Master 00:52:04 You see like an atom traveling through your brain at light speed as it glides. And you realize that you have to think about where you're going to get there. And in theory, it should be fast to will yourself a certain direction. But with anybody who has an intelligence of zero, you move five feet.
Barrow Berkshire 00:52:10 Brain blast.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:52:13 It's Jimmy fucking Neutron.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:52:27 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:52:30 for round which in general movement slow but it moves um then people with negative are like barely moving through they're like kind of tumbling in your direction so you'd have to keep them in the shield and you have to kind of tether the other two with you to move at a reasonable pace but you uh yeah it's by mind powers that you float
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:52:51 Everybody hold on, we're moving quick.
Karak 00:52:51 Thank you.
Gooch III 00:52:55 So I'm gonna, like, my eyes are gonna open in, and I'm gonna be like, got it. Just think, think about it. Guys, imagine thinking about moving forward.
Dungeon Master 00:53:03 the card burns and disappears from in front of you. You start to inch forward, yeah.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:53:21 I move backwards. Oh, you burst out of my shell. Oh.
Gooch III 00:53:21 And then I'm going to go like this. And I'm going to think about just inching forward. Does it work? Oh, fuck. Yeah, guys. Just rips off alien style.
Dungeon Master 00:53:37 You, a little clumsy at first, you kind of start to tumble a little bit, but you catch yourself.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:53:51 I meant out of the neck hole, dude. Use your last wish. Fix my fucking shell. All right. I started thinking as well.
Barrow Berkshire 00:53:56 They fucking owe me.
Dungeon Master 00:54:14 Okay, you guys. One by one, start to apply your brains for maybe the first time. And you. Oh, perfect. I'm going to say that gives you five extra feet. That's clever. A lot of motivation. You're like a sea worm. Like those...
Gooch III 00:54:16 I'll throw some rope. Ha ha ha.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:54:22 I huck my flask ahead of me so I have a target to keep me going. Oh, my God. I'm having withdrawals. I got to get to that flask.
Barrow Berkshire 00:54:32 Barrow uses peristalsis with his fat. I'm fucking like... My fat's just rolling forward. Yeah. You could use your fucking trunk as a propeller.
Dungeon Master 00:54:43 Sea slugs in the depth of the ocean. Boomer alabaster.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:54:48 think alabaster really isn't moving much he's just kind of flailing wildly very frustrated of course i can hear what do you think i am an imbecile my ears i have no such time for childish movies
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:54:53 Your ears, dude. Your ears. No, dude. Opa Dumbo style. Opa Dumbo style, dude. Flap those puppies. Flap those puppies.
Karak 00:55:03 All right.
Barrow Berkshire 00:55:09 Have you ever seen Dumbo? Are you an African or Asian elephant? How much velocity are we working with?
Alabaster Leatherback 00:55:18 I'm gonna I want to kind of like, start wiggling the ears and then a little bit. And I'm kind of spinning, but I'm spinning in the right direction. Tumbling. Definitely an Asian Asian elephant. Yeah. Yeah. But I have three three trunks. Oh,
Karak 00:55:33 Smaller ears.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:55:38 Oh, small ears. Yeah. You know, we do, at least I have routinely forgotten about that. No wonder you smell so good. Size and amount of noses.
Barrow Berkshire 00:55:38 Oh, but that's why it took so long. No wonder. Yeah, I did forget about that. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, your cologne is nice, man.
Dungeon Master 00:55:47 I was right. You have great trauma. He likes your cologne, dude.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:55:52 I'm sorry? Yeah. Well, I did get it in the Feywild at this shop here. It's quite nice. The vendor was selling high-end perfumes. Anyways, let's move on. We have a mission.
Karak 00:56:05 My head hurts from all that thinking, man. I just barely got down here.
Barrow Berkshire 00:56:06 It's all put together. I'm like, all of money. All of money.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:56:20 That's the alabaster we know. Her leader. Dude, eat a cookie, dude. Your blood sugar's low. You're fading. Prick your finger. You got a test. You can't forget.
Gooch III 00:56:28 Thank you.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:56:30 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:56:32 Sorry, I'll just beard.
Barrow Berkshire 00:56:41 Your Dexcom is beeping, bro. Yeah, his internet. Yeah, you've given two fucking PCs diabetes in that session. Yeah, yeah.
Karak 00:56:45 Yeah.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:56:52 Okay, I'm sorry. I just canonically made you have diabetes. And I have alcoholism, so we all have our gripes.
Dungeon Master 00:57:03 He's got type 1, not type 2. Not his fault. Eventually, you guys land at the base of an enormous ascending staircase. Pretty much exactly how it looked there. It is this gorgeous palace set in the middle of this eternal astral sea.
Barrow Berkshire 00:57:09 Mine is absolutely behavior-based. That is for sure.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:57:25 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:57:34 and this would be from common lore be known as the eternal court the center of all fae politics in the golden age of the fae world where the last true monarch of the fae lived before they were eventually killed how would you guys interesting point you're looking for the tree of death which you know is in
Barrow Berkshire 00:57:53 And this is where we're trying to end up, like this is the goal. Okay. No way. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:58:02 The Eternal Court, I would say that I don't know that any of you have been here personally before. So you're sort of following where you feel like you have to go, but it seems a little out of place. You're looking for a tree. You're in this natural sea.
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:58:09 you
Dungeon Master 00:58:20 At the base of this, and you won't have to fight them because they're so mechanically lower CR than you, you see set up as guard outposts, little packs of dogmen and wolves set up as sentries on the perimeter of this castle.
Barrow Berkshire 00:58:36 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:58:39 And you guys haven't been discovered yet because you're so far away, but you would know that you have to approach with some caution. You hit the ground, so you guys have normal walking speed at this point. You don't have to wheel yourself through the air right now. But how would you guys like to approach entering? Do you still feel like this is where you're supposed to go?
Tortimus Staggerfin 00:59:06 I mean, does it feel like we need to be sneaky?
Barrow Berkshire 00:59:10 How many of these dog people, like, is there specific numbers that, like, packs of them? I don't know.
Dungeon Master 00:59:19 small packs so if you guys went in guns a blazing you would get there and i wouldn't take hp away just because again they're real they're real weenies and you guys would just like mechanically find a way to take a long rest so it'd be not worth it but um there are many of them so what you would infer from seeing it is that this seems like an established setup
Dungeon Master 00:59:44 You didn't know that they were here, but these people have been in this space for more than just a couple days. Some look like gnolls, some just look like wolves, some just look like dogmen. They're just like the warriors or the subservients of the three boars that are the leaders of the group.
Alabaster Leatherback 00:59:51 Are these like nulls? Got it.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:00:08 Bye.
Karak 01:00:11 All right.
Barrow Berkshire 01:00:15 Oh. Like, these aren't the typical guards of, like, the Fey court that would be here. They're with, like, the people that... Okay. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:00:31 No, the previous lords of the Fey Court were all elven, so you would expect some sort of Aladrin mix to be huge. Again, the Feywild has been in some disarray for a long time. So like bandits kind of rule in isolated camps of power. They're always fighting each other. But you didn't know that they were set up where the old ruler used to be set up.
Barrow Berkshire 01:00:45 Okay. Okay. All good.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:00:55 Thank you.
Gooch III 01:00:57 Hey, I'm back. Sorry I had to fix the Internet. So should we kill him?
Dungeon Master 01:01:01 You're good. You guys just found this palace and you found it's being guarded by some wolf men and they seem pretty established. And that's where you guys have gotten so far.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:01:15 That's what I was thinking, Gooch. Let's move along and slay these lupine creatures.
Barrow Berkshire 01:01:20 God, I wish I had a fucking bow. I could really shoot these guys from afar. Fuck. I could use one. They're going to notice that they get picked off one by one. We might as well just go and fight them.
Gooch III 01:01:27 Can you use a bow? Do you have the ability? Because I have a short bow. As you say that, I'll just...
Dungeon Master 01:01:31 Mechanically, he probably could. Um...
Karak 01:01:31 Roger.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:01:42 He did go to... He did attend... He attended four years of art school.
Dungeon Master 01:01:48 While this next section is, it'll be a group stealth check or it'll be group dexterity checks because mechanically, even though they're weak, they probably would miss nearly all of their attacks. There is enough of them to surround you at any given point that they could damage the little amber beings that you have sort of strapped to your back. So recklessness encourages that you might kill the chosen ones. Stealth gives you a better chance of succeeding.
Dungeon Master 01:02:19 But, you know, again, three successes per three failures, depending on the route you take. Dexterity. Dexterity checks.
Gooch III 01:02:27 I'm stealthy as shit. I'm also dextrous.
Barrow Berkshire 01:02:29 We might as well try to sneak around. All of us are little. All of us are small. Yeah.
Karak 01:02:30 I'm pretty stealthy. What was the other option? My stealth is better. I'm proficient in it. We just need three wins.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:02:33 pretty good stuff
Alabaster Leatherback 01:02:40 Dexterity saving. I am not very stealthy. I have a plus zero and I have disadvantage. You and your port. God is not going to hide behind that pillar.
Gooch III 01:02:57 You say that as I'm looking up from your knee. Just a monolith. I'm going to start sneaking.
Barrow Berkshire 01:03:02 I could hide behind that pillar. So we might as well try that. Our dex is going to be worse than our stealth almost always. Like metagaming wise. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:03:06 It's like broken. Okay. That is a DC 16 average. So you guys as the group have to average out to 16. 25. Hell yeah.
Karak 01:03:07 We're just going to hide behind alabaster. Yeah. I'm going to roll one of those stealth checks. Okay.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:03:24 Easy, with this nat- with this nat 20. I got a nat 1, fuck! Fuck. I drank too much. I stumbled and hit a column.
Barrow Berkshire 01:03:32 But that's a good start.
Dungeon Master 01:03:36 18. 8. 8. Nat 1 is 2 fail. Nat 20. So the Nat 1, the Nat 20 will disappear. It's a 25 and 18 and 8. That is like a
Gooch III 01:03:44 Nice. We need one more.
Karak 01:03:47 Last one. Last one counts. That was it. That was all. Let's go. Might just barely be 13, 16, 17. What's the math on that?
Alabaster Leatherback 01:03:53 Hey, there it is. That's funny.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:03:55 Hey! Good enough.
Dungeon Master 01:04:07 No, that's good. That's a pretty good average, actually.
Barrow Berkshire 01:04:11 Wow.
Gooch III 01:04:15 I think it's like 17 17 point something.
Karak 01:04:17 Yeah, yeah. It's above the bar, above the bar.
Dungeon Master 01:04:18 yeah so you guys carefully this is a deep palace and you guys are sort of very sneakily moving between shadows it's the astral sea so it's very dark and purples and blues are like the color schemes some like light red sprinkled in there but really dark colors um of this very historic old place that has not been fully inhabited for a while you know that um
Dungeon Master 01:04:49 This place was ran by the previous monarch of the Eternal Court, the last person to wear the... What did I call it? It's... The Eternal Weave. It was an elf by the name of Lonre Salitos. Not of a whole lot of importance...
Dungeon Master 01:05:14 But that was just the last monarch. And then, in theory, out of game would be, like, one of the closest living relatives to, like, Kaladin's true heritage. But as you guys go through and you see these various artworks and everything, and you're sort of sneaking between these little wolf encampments, you continue to descend and descend and descend and descend.
Dungeon Master 01:05:42 Finally, you kind of get to the last two rooms. You are in the communal room, the dance hall equivalent. And beyond that, you know to be the throne room, which would make sense as your final stop. So as you guys hit sort of the dance hall, do you like to take any precautions or steps at this point?
Alabaster Leatherback 01:06:12 I'm going to put on my dancing shoes first. So in case we get cornered, I can do a little performance, do a little jig and maybe distract them.
Gooch III 01:06:12 Oh shit.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:06:12 Hmm.
Barrow Berkshire 01:06:27 One of my new ranger abilities is to give myself temporary hit points with an action. So I'm going to use one of those actions.
Dungeon Master 01:06:37 Gooch, roll your temporary hit points for the day, by the way. Oh, you just get 10. Add your 10 temporary hit points as well. Picking up all of your attention. You actually have to be quiet. You hear from beyond the room.
Gooch III 01:06:42 I just get 10. Okay. I'm just going to use my action to stop my elderly father from making a bunch of polarizing political comments. Now. Now. Snap. Please stop.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:06:59 Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:07:02 Uh,
Barrow Berkshire 01:07:06 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:07:06 three sort of more gruff voices speaking to each other not in hushed tones but far enough away that you don't really make it out but very recognizably these are the same people who have been chasing you through the whole Feywild
Dungeon Master 01:07:25 in search of what you're carrying, but you don't know why. And as you sort of get up to the door, would you guys like to sort of listen in, get yourself to position, burst in with your style here? Yes, it's true.
Barrow Berkshire 01:07:40 I mean, we're all dumb. You put your fucking foot in his tail hole.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:07:44 Alabaster, kick me through the door. Throw me like the green shell I am. Oh! You made me... Oh!
Alabaster Leatherback 01:07:48 All right, son, I like your action. And I'm just going to pick him up. I was like, pull that head in. And I'm going to stuff my ass, stuff my foot right into his ass and just launch him.
Dungeon Master 01:08:03 tortimus crashes through the door it is made of a beautiful stained glass with the metal frame and it goes shatters and you hear the crack of the glass and the metal as it bends out and blows out sideways tortimus hits the ground and it's like a sheer marble finish so he slides and spins kind of angling at first as he goes into the room where it comes to a halt on the rug
Gooch III 01:08:03 Absolutely.
Karak 01:08:12 I don't.
Barrow Berkshire 01:08:16 Okay.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:08:28 I'm throwing up all the booze in my lunch. It's like the opening scene of Pitch Perfect.
Dungeon Master 01:08:33 We'll just go right to the next map. I love it. Tortoise will be the first one to take this in. In this room, it's sort of more destroyed than the map is going to make it seem. There's like dirt piles and refuse and discarded bones and meat and various things that they've taken for themselves. But the key things of feature are...
Barrow Berkshire 01:08:57 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:08:58 like beautifully regular interval torches surrounding the room. The whole room disappears into like eternal space past the windows. So it seems like just like a sheer drop into the astral sea. And at the very head of the throne room is a large regal
Dungeon Master 01:09:16 royal purple chair with stained glass behind it art pieces sort of surrounding it and to the side and in front on your right side is a willow tree rooted into the marble kind of breaking it up um
Dungeon Master 01:09:33 looks a little sickly compared to how you'd expect a normal tree, but it seems very nicely manicured even for being here as long as it has, um, sort of off to the side on its own and standing in the center of the room are three of these four villains who are just like chatting with each other. One of them seems to be like pointing to his stomach, like he's pretty uncomfortable. Uh,
Dungeon Master 01:10:01 And they all sort of turn to you and the stomach sort of swivel in front last as they like make their little snort sounds at the sudden explosion of noise. And as Tortimus sort of speaks to a stop and has a chance to stand up, does he want to say something or just like awkwardly stand there?
Alabaster Leatherback 01:10:12 Yeah. I'm going to
Barrow Berkshire 01:10:23 Yeah, can we all make intimidation face at least?
Gooch III 01:10:24 Give him a line, Alabaster. Give him a line.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:10:25 I just got... I just say, my fucking asshole, you guys are gonna pay Alabaster, you're after these guys, and I'm gonna just, like, boxing pose. This guy's gonna kick you guys in the asshole.
Dungeon Master 01:10:42 Give me an intimidation check. Give me a performance check and an intimidation check.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:10:43 Walk in behind with an intimidation check. Yeah, that's what I was going to say. Yeah. I'm walking on the next step. I'm going to put my foot through your ass unless you turn tail and get out of here. And with that performance check.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:10:54 See this? Your turn. You three now. Can I help since I'm... Can I help since I'm evidence that his butt kicks work? Oh, fuck.
Karak 01:11:11 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:11:14 Tortimus, you are making the performance check. Alabaster's making the deception, the intimidation. Gooch the second's naked body squeals on the freshly waxed floors. He gets caught and all this skin folds kind of pull him to a stop at one point.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:11:16 Okay, yeah, I'll do the intimidate. Yeah, nice. Oh, yeah. That was pretty good.
Gooch III 01:11:22 I'd like to also add that Gooch the second and the fourth squirted out through the armholes when you put your foot in his ass. He stops quick.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:11:28 Oh, Nat 20! I turn around, I have a red ass, like a baboon. Also had a Nat 20.
Barrow Berkshire 01:11:37 Sounds like a fucking basketball shoot.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:11:50 Yeah, that's great.
Dungeon Master 01:11:52 not 2017 a great check uh and in fact you see uh i don't know if i told you their names but um there are three of them standing in a line and um you see uh
Dungeon Master 01:12:13 Your left to right, you see one of them is like kind of barrel chested, kind of muscular, but a little flabby. Sort of the middle of the three of them, short cut kind of mohawk hair, small tusks, but two sets of them coming up like a distinct like reddish brown fur color.
Dungeon Master 01:12:35 um his name would be brought if you were to ask him it uh sort of seems really alarmed by the statement you make um the one on the far right is really rotund and sort of the most meager looking of the three of them shortest squattest least defined hair kind of shaggy a little bit over his head really small tusks and like carrying only like a spear his name is belly
Dungeon Master 01:13:05 if you were to ask, and he was the one who was sort of like scratching at a stomach uncomfortably. The one in front is taller than the rest.
Dungeon Master 01:13:13 a dark brown color stained with blood, muscular boar form. He's got like almost all of his teeth kind of jut out of his mouth in jagged patterns, all overgrown with his lead tusks, huge and up in the sky. He's got a flowing mane of hair that goes down his back, looks freshly, uh, shampooed, conditioned, oiled, um, large sword at his side. And this is Sir Loin, um,
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:13:36 Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:13:43 And the three of them sort of stand in front of you, giving a little bit of gumption, if you will. And Sir Loin speaks up. He goes, well, well, well, if it isn't the Guardians. And he drags his sword and he goes, guided you right where I wanted you. Now let me monologue.
Dungeon Master 01:14:13 He's not going to super pay attention. You can tell he's been preparing this. He drops a little bit of a paper to his side and scoots it behind him. Going on about how the Feywild was once proud. And you feel free to rearrange yourselves in the room if you want. I'll put your tokens down. I have a different token for them. But this is a chance. You do.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:14:36 I take time to put an ice pack on my ass. It's not like you put your hooves together and it's extra pointy.
Barrow Berkshire 01:14:44 I do the pig sign for flipping them off because we don't have fingers, but we all know what it is. Yeah. And one of my little toes on my hoof is up, but not the other. One is a thumbs up, but I do it to flip off one. So we have two options.
Karak 01:14:49 You.
Gooch III 01:14:53 It's like this.
Dungeon Master 01:15:01 You can't go past the midway of the room, so if they're standing in the center, you don't want to get too close to them, but you can sort of go around the perimeter a little bit. So if one of you wanted to strategically be closer to the tree, you could be. If you want to be closer up, you could. And he continues about...
Karak 01:15:27 How tall is the building? Okay. Okay. I forgot about that. I forgot about that.
Dungeon Master 01:15:30 This is an enormous space, over 100 feet tall in the air. A team of flies. I forgot that. And he keeps monologuing about how they were the prey for the longest time, but what they had that nobody else was.
Barrow Berkshire 01:15:34 Yeah, my flies lift me up like 10 feet off the ground.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:15:35 Oh, shit. Yeah. That's come up so little. That's so good. Bye, repeat. Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:16:01 bastions of power and fortitude and nobody could take them down once the face started to crumble and they levered this powerful and safety position to gain and amass armies of wolves who needed safety and eventually they went from being prey to warlords and he's talking about how
Dungeon Master 01:16:19 they realized that the, the vague courts were weak. They didn't have it. So once we were powerful enough, we went and we took them out one by one. And you see like notions to individual skulls, mountain on pikes, that perimeter of the room with the torches, all very elven in form. The mystery of like what happened to the fake courts could be explained by this with that claim. Um, and, um,
Barrow Berkshire 01:16:20 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:16:49 He doesn't totally give it away, but he hints that they came across this power from a powerful archfey who only made one request in exchange. And he goes, just like an off comment, he goes, this guy just punched Brat in the face and disappeared. So it looks like we got off easy. And as he's talking, go ahead and give me perception checks.
Barrow Berkshire 01:17:33 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:17:40 I gotta find the right thing. Okay, give it to me a second. 14, 18, 22, 14, 15. The 22 will do it from just in the corner. You see Belly, who's in the corner sort of scratching at his stomach.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:17:43 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:18:10 At the mention of this figure only asked for one thing in return from each of them. He wanted to harm them once.
Dungeon Master 01:18:19 each and he punched brought in the face and then left and so in theory this would kind of unfold in real time as you saw it you see belly scratching in his stomach is like getting fervorish and he just keeps going keeps going and he's scratching at his hide and as he like scratches away the fur you see that
Dungeon Master 01:18:41 Carved into his skin, large and bleeding and sort of inking black ichor is a phrase that says, four for a birth. And it has four kind of bird-like depictions carved off the side.
Dungeon Master 01:18:59 almost like it came out of nowhere as he's scratching at his stomach. And then you see his body starts to bloat and expand in his arms. Like almost like they have a sudden onset of like severe lymphedema, just like balloon out elephantitis. Like, and he gets like to this bobble-ish form and then he expands and he becomes this enormous monster, almost gargantuan in size. He fills up the whole room.
Dungeon Master 01:19:27 Sir Loin doesn't seem to notice as he's monoling. This is happening behind him as he's finishing his speech. You see Brat kind of backs off in the corner, gets really scared.
Dungeon Master 01:19:38 And this creature that like starts snorting behind Sirloin gets irritated, used to being the leader. And he says, what is going on back there? And he turns around and belly bites him in half, tearing his form apart, throws the legs against all splatters against the window. It lets out.
Dungeon Master 01:19:57 This awful, horrifying, foul screech as you smell just blood and decay on its breath as this now enormous form is in the center of the room. And I would like everybody to roll for initiative as we go into this. I don't know. Your intimidation means that Brat isn't going to act right away.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:20:10 My big sore asshole makes him take a turn less.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:20:18 I take it our intimidation didn't do much. Okay. Get ready, man. This is what we train for. Shape up.
Barrow Berkshire 01:20:29 so he's the only one in the room now other than us
Dungeon Master 01:20:48 um there is brought who is the other page sort of in the corner but not acting and there is this large monstrosity get rid of all that stuff i don't know why his um token isn't got a picture of it
Karak 01:20:50 to.
Barrow Berkshire 01:20:59 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:21:17 I'll figure it out. But as you guys are doing that, let me load it back up. Yes, he's got legs. Yeah, let me get out. I'm trying to figure out why this...
Gooch III 01:21:24 Does it still have legs? Yeah, the initiative thing just blanked too. Oh.
Barrow Berkshire 01:21:34 Do we have a token for bra as well? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:21:47 Yeah, I cleared it because there's a bunch of old stuff on it. I will add you all back in. Combat tracker. Is that your guys' initiative you just rolled?
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:21:50 yeah.
Karak 01:22:01 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:22:17 image. Address.
Barrow Berkshire 01:22:42 That's pretty fucking sick. Honestly dude, fuck you. Fuck you.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:22:43 Pharaoh, they should have taught you that in school. Fuck. It's just too easy, dude.
Gooch III 01:22:44 Holy shit.
Dungeon Master 01:22:48 And now that I've got everything, he re-rolls his initiative. Tardim is so mean to Barrow.
Barrow Berkshire 01:23:11 You'll see what I'm capable of soon fucking enough.
Dungeon Master 01:23:19 We're going to just call this one Bra. OK. So that'll be the setup right there, supposedly. Everybody's rolled initiative. We're going to take a quick breather. Refresh on the smoke job.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:23:22 That it won't be from afar, dude.
Dungeon Master 01:23:48 And then we'll get into the fight to end the Fae. Nice. I'll be right back. Well, actually...
Gooch III 01:23:54 Sweet.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:23:56 Nice.
Karak 01:24:19 Rex, dude, you were golfing so well yesterday, man. Did you get two birdies, like real birdies yesterday? That's rad. That's rad. That's rad.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:24:23 yeah you know i i was having some some good rounds yeah uh two two proper birdies yeah that was pretty sick i'm definitely i think i've kind of hit a step change and like skill i mean i'm definitely not good but
Dungeon Master 01:24:47 Rex, that is really impressive. For reference, yesterday I shot four bogeys, but I had zero birdies. I was four over just because I wasn't getting anything back. So the fact that you kept hitting birdies, even though you were bogeying, is a great, great sign.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:24:50 I think I've hit the point where at least I can golf. Yeah. Yeah, I just need more consistency, which I think with practice I'll get there.
Karak 01:24:50 Milestones, man. Milestones.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:25:17 Yeah. It's fun to, fun to actually be able to feel like I can like visualize a shot, you know, like it's tough when you're just like, I'm going to just huck this thing. I don't know what's going to happen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it goes a little too high and it clips to the left, but
Barrow Berkshire 01:25:17 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:25:24 Well, do you have a predictable shot, Faith? That's really nice. Yeah, but now you know in general what it's going to do, so you know kind of how to fix it, right?
Karak 01:25:30 That's yeah, fair point.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:25:47 Yeah. Yeah, definitely. No, it's fine. Yeah. That's so true. Yeah. Cause I, for the longest time, it was like all of these might as well be the same. They're all terrible. I don't think there's anything different about them. Yeah.
Barrow Berkshire 01:25:50 Disc golf gets way more fun once all the discs actually do different stuff. Once you throw hard enough and straight enough that the discs do what the numbers say they're going to, it gets way more fun. Yeah, exactly. That would be exactly the same thing. Who gives a shit what I throw?
Dungeon Master 01:25:56 Yes. Yeah.
Karak 01:26:11 It's... I... I was going to say... It... I was going to say... No, because we... Because...
Alabaster Leatherback 01:26:17 Yeah, it was a real shame that I fucking gave up that Saint. Next time... We looked a lot, dude. I don't know where it went. It just fucking disappeared, man. Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:26:22 You didn't give it up. Between the two groups, we covered the entire area. It either buried, that guy picked it up on his way through, because there were two discs in that tree. What if one of his discs landed up there and he grabbed one of them to go? Okay. Yeah.
Karak 01:26:40 No, because we were out there right when they were even just walking through playing. I wasn't worried about having someone else grabbing it. I think it buried itself. I think it just landed soft enough to where it just skidded under some dirt and we just didn't see it. Because that area was so open. Yeah. Just like
Alabaster Leatherback 01:26:47 I mean, yeah, I don't think that would be. Yeah. Yeah. In a bush or something. I don't know. Yeah. I mean, I guess it's kind of, yeah. Yeah. Somebody is going to have a, have a good day. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:26:57 And it was black and clear. It's just a shame there's no name or number. Halloween limited edition, not a single scratch in it, you know. That's true.
Karak 01:27:10 This is crazy. Halloween disc? Well, that's the same one. I remember the one I most recently found was the Christmas edition. Was it George or Greg? Get that back.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:27:24 Oh, yeah. You know, well, next time you guys pass through, pick me up a Saint. I'll pay you for it. Yeah. I got to have one of those. I'm going to keep throwing that Valkyrie for sure. I do like that disc. That was a lot of fun.
Dungeon Master 01:27:34 I don't know. You did so good with the Valpar. Do you even really need a different one? I think you're muted if you're talking. You look like you're talking.
Karak 01:27:43 Okay.
Barrow Berkshire 01:27:56 Thank you. Thank you, my ones. Say, the Valkyrie was sweet. Every time you threw it on your second shot, it was, like, sick and, like, fast and dead straight. Like, I don't know what it was, but you throw it on the tee shots, there was, like, stuff. Not the same. Yeah.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:28:08 that's true yeah yeah it's just fucking yeah i even flight i mean like i gotta probably stop what i should probably do is throw my regular shot then just give a flick just for the practice but it's nice to have that one in my bag too so i felt like i was actually able to get distance on a couple of flicks too yeah
Karak 01:28:13 You know zone where you were flicking that zone that was that was zipping along.
Barrow Berkshire 01:28:34 Yeah, but flip was nice, actually. You're kind of tucking that thing around. Yeah, that was sweet. Yeah, when you were trying to pump. It was funny.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:28:39 Yeah. Yeah, especially that disc is kind of wild. Yeah, like, Alright, I'm gonna putt with this. Yeah, just cruise on by. The issue is, it's like, I'm like thinking myself, I'm like, Alright, I'm just gonna give a real light touch. And then it just like kept going. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:28:53 You kept absolutely fucking things the wrong way. Just so far as you didn't think it'd go that far.
Karak 01:29:06 Utilize it.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:29:09 Which I mean, honestly, that's a good thing to have like on a true approach. I just gotta calibrate to what it's gonna do. All right.
Barrow Berkshire 01:29:26 I just looked through all my ranger abilities again, and I was definitely underutilizing my abilities last time. It's way cooler. I mean, it was cool. The flies are fun, but there's other things that, yeah, in a dynamic kind of fight, it'll be useful.
Dungeon Master 01:29:32 Okay.
Karak 01:29:36 There's a lot more. Let's go.
Barrow Berkshire 01:29:58 I'm just so uninterested in just using a bow as a ranger, which I knew. That's why I chose this ranger class, but I hate sitting back and casting spells, shooting a bow, whatever it is. It's not my speed. The axe of returning was one of my favorite things as Stout.
Karak 01:30:07 Yeah. Well,
Dungeon Master 01:30:09 Something wrong with that one. I remember you used it all the time.
Barrow Berkshire 01:30:29 That wasn't, like, a god item. Like, I used it a lot. It was super fun for fighting. He put their...
Karak 01:30:37 Jonathan, what are the specs on the orb? Just in case that gets thrown. Throws the orb in my inventory? I want to look.
Dungeon Master 01:30:45 I think it's in your inventory, isn't it? Check. I might not have. I've got it written somewhere.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:30:57 Okay.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:31:29 you you
Dungeon Master 01:31:33 Oh, it's on my phone. That's what it is. So I can't see it. Um, it is, um, a like, um, like a disintegration spell, but on an AOE. So you throw it and it's every enemy within a 15 foot radius has to make a, um, dexterity saving throw or take like the damage from disintegration spell, which is, um,
Karak 01:31:36 It's 100 or 10 to 10.
Dungeon Master 01:32:01 Jesus, I think it's like 10d10 plus 40 or something like that. 10d6 plus 40. Hello, Winston.
Karak 01:32:04 Yeah. 40. I concur. All right. And that's that items non transferable. I think it is that is used today or gone forever. Okay.
Barrow Berkshire 01:32:07 Baby, sit. Sit down. Say hi. When it says hi, there's uncles and there's friends. Sit. Sit down. Say hi.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:32:12 Hello, Bowie. Hello, Bowie.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:32:24 That's big.
Dungeon Master 01:32:35 Oh, we're all back. Sweet. You ready?
Barrow Berkshire 01:32:41 He says hi.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:32:51 mm-hmm
Karak 01:32:53 Yeah, I'm good. Making some tea real quick.
Gooch III 01:33:03 Do it.
Dungeon Master 01:33:10 Okay, first up is Belly the Boar Titan. He's going to start things off with Jesus, I gave him a lot of stuff. I don't mean that as a good thing.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:33:39 you
Dungeon Master 01:33:40 He's going to make his attacks, and then he's got something called Gravity Grunt. So he'll start off by doing... You see he gets down almost on all of his haunches and lets out an enormous sort of grunt expression of mist and smoke from his mouth.
Barrow Berkshire 01:33:52 Perfect.
Dungeon Master 01:34:08 It is everybody in front of him must give me a dexterity saving throw as a 10 by 30 foot wave just kind of blast past you real quick. I'm going to figure it out.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:34:27 damn that was a 20 in the world
Karak 01:34:29 Who all is in front of? Is that just Alabaster and... Is that Barrow to the left? Yeah. He's hiding.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:34:32 So is that hitting everybody?
Barrow Berkshire 01:34:35 Okay. Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:34:41 It'll be everybody but Cordemus there on the right, isn't it? Oh, that's Carrick. And Gooch. Are you way back there? It's up to you. I had you guys move yourself, so you could put yourself where you would have started at. Okay. He can get...
Gooch III 01:34:53 I didn't want to be back that far. I wanted to be up, but I wanted to be... I wanted to be, like, here. Yeah, just... I wanted to be off to the side. Shit. Nice.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:35:03 Bye.
Karak 01:35:09 I technically wanted to be flying. 20 feet.
Barrow Berkshire 01:35:12 in the arc of everybody else. I think he chose it. Fuck. Yeah. Damn.
Dungeon Master 01:35:15 How far up do you want to be? Okay, so you'll be 30 feet up. It'll be Barrow, Alabaster, and Tortimus in front of him. So their deck saves. Alabaster, that's a fail. Barrow, that's a fail. Just barely. That's really close. 12, that's a failure.
Dungeon Master 01:35:42 You each take 2d8 damage. Not bad. Blows you backwards. You take 5 points. And that is force damage and you are knocked prone. And then he takes his cleaver attacks.
Barrow Berkshire 01:35:46 I tried to jump out of the way and fucking eat shit. It knocks me right off my flies. Just fucking eat shit out of my mouth.
Karak 01:35:52 Ugh.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:35:52 I'll just take it head on.
Gooch III 01:35:53 thank you
Dungeon Master 01:36:09 I hand wrote it so it's not just a button. I gotta roll this shit. He'll do one on each of you. 24 to hit Barrow. Jesus. 29 to hit Alabaster.
Gooch III 01:36:30 Like me dude Free attacks fuck me
Barrow Berkshire 01:36:31 Yeah, that'll do it for sure.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:36:37 Yeah, big hit.
Dungeon Master 01:36:39 13 to hit Portima. Nice. Yes, three attacks. The two hits. 11 damage to Barrow.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:36:42 Does not hit.
Karak 01:36:42 Well.
Dungeon Master 01:37:08 And 10 damage to Alabaster. And then he will close the distance to you. After that, it is Carrick.
Karak 01:37:26 Yeah, I'm going to fly in a manner so that I can kind of move forward and then fall on top of him while making a melee attack. I believe that will activate what would be the Stormcaller's Descent.
Dungeon Master 01:37:43 Okay. Oh, how interesting. What does that look like as the party actually gets to see what your sword does?
Karak 01:38:01 So I think this would be a combination because I still carry my shield, but this is so my sword would it's called the eye of the storm. It's just really good thing for a sword. I think it would. I don't think it would crackle with like electric energy, but I think it might emanate like a darker sort of purple, maybe like you or glow as it activated or did things.
Gooch III 01:38:09 Nice. Yeah. Nice.
Barrow Berkshire 01:38:14 Yeah, sick.
Karak 01:38:29 And so I think this feature in particular, yeah, this activates if I fall more than 20 feet while making a melee attack. I can then add 2d6 thunder damage if I land the attack. And so I think what I'm really doing with this attack is I've just got my shield and my sword stacked on top of my shield. I'm just falling directly on the enemy all the time.
Dungeon Master 01:38:30 kind of lightning-y.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:38:46 Bye.
Gooch III 01:38:57 Oh, shit. Nice.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:38:59 That's sick.
Karak 01:39:02 So yeah, if I fall at the right angle, would I have any sort of chance of having advantage with Alabaster already engaged in being quite large? Just asking. I haven't raged yet. Isn't that just a bonus action?
Barrow Berkshire 01:39:14 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:39:17 Are you not raging? Yeah, you wouldn't have to. I mean, you could, so you can get the extra rage damage. But also, yes, you could go down and then just five feet forward make your attack, like a little swoop.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:39:31 Hello. Hello.
Karak 01:39:33 no so actually i have to be raging to do the storm bonus action would have happened before i did okay yeah so to do i just read that to do the storm colors descent to add that extra thunder damage i have to be raging so bonus action bridge general 1d8
Dungeon Master 01:39:56 I guess a bonus action raid. Let's see that attack roll.
Karak 01:40:03 Now you saw this extra work. I was throwing a 1D8. What's a 1 on the wild? It's just a dude every time. I know. I'm really slow with it.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:40:03 Thank you.
Barrow Berkshire 01:40:03 It's hard to remember if that pays a lot of attention, I think. I can't say it all. Oh, shit.
Gooch III 01:40:25 Oh shit, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:40:26 Oh, right, Wild Magic. What does that do? I forgot.
Karak 01:40:35 Wild Surge. Click on it. Table of Fears. One. Oh, this is pretty good. Shadowy tendrils lash out around you. Each creature that you see within 30 feet must make a constitution saving throw or take necrotic damage. Uh...
Barrow Berkshire 01:40:37 That could fuck us so hard. So it's not just enemies? Is anyone to see?
Karak 01:41:03 It does just read that you can... No. Your choice that you can see. It's up to me. So two enemies, just looking at them. They'll make a constitution saving throw. It's totally pass. Oh, okay.
Barrow Berkshire 01:41:10 All right.
Dungeon Master 01:41:16 23 for the monster. Very constitutional. And natural one on Brock. Yeah. Yeah.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:41:17 Thank you.
Gooch III 01:41:23 Nice.
Karak 01:41:33 So 1d12 for damage. All right, for six and then let's get on. And then we'll get on with the attack. So now that I'm raging, I will attack.
Dungeon Master 01:41:50 Six points of damage. You got the first one straight. 27 hits. What a good roll.
Karak 01:41:57 The first one will just be regular, and then, like you said, I'll sort of do this landing attack, and then I'll step forward, and I'll have advantage on the second. Is that what you said? First one straight, which will be a 27 to hit. All right, so that's going to be a...
Gooch III 01:42:13 Nice.
Karak 01:42:34 They're just rolling really slow. They're pretty good though. They're at 16. One of them was an eight. One of them was a, so we, yeah. It's a fun catch. We'll have to keep remembering that. That's good. Plus, plus additional three. So 19.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:42:37 This guy listens to the rules.
Dungeon Master 01:42:39 That's okay. 16. Ooh! Exploding dice. Roll that 8 again. 19 damage.
Barrow Berkshire 01:42:44 Exploding dice. I love Max's.
Gooch III 01:42:50 Oh shit. Nice.
Karak 01:43:06 And then I'll step forward and do advantage on the second attack. Oh, same thing. Yep. And then...
Dungeon Master 01:43:12 I'll forget. 28 hits, obviously. 19, 18. No, it's just the one.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:43:14 Anti features.
Barrow Berkshire 01:43:14 I will not say it for when you roll, Jonathan. I won't. So you better catch me. I'm not playing fair both times. Wow, what good rolls. Every roll you did was fucking crazy. Oh, it's just the time.
Gooch III 01:43:21 Fuck me, dude. Jesus Christ.
Karak 01:43:33 Damage is... That was a seven, so I'm going to roll again because there's been two at the top of it. Just the one. All right. There you go. There you are. Good. Well positioned. Let's get this guy in place. That's my... That's my character right now.
Barrow Berkshire 01:43:45 Nice, though. That was sweet. What's a fighter thing? That was sweet.
Gooch III 01:43:51 Don't you crit on, like, 19 and 18? Or is that a different character? Oh, okay. Never mind. Okay. Oh, sweet.
Dungeon Master 01:43:57 Those are fighters. Okay. Good turn. Anything else on your turn? After your turn, he's going to use a legendary action. And in fact, he's going to use all three of his legendary actions. He's going to use Saucaller Scream.
Karak 01:44:09 Uh, no.
Dungeon Master 01:44:26 Each creature within 20 feet must succeed on a strength-saving throw or be pulled 15 feet toward belly and take damage. With spending three actions, he slams his cleavers into the ground and causing a 20-foot explosion. Everybody must make a different save on the second part of it. Okay, so it'll be a deck save and then a two-deck save.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:44:26 Bye.
Karak 01:44:51 All right, string C. Did you say string? Or is it? Go ahead.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:44:57 Thank you.
Barrow Berkshire 01:44:57 Okay, so we're going strength save first.
Dungeon Master 01:44:59 Yeah, so, okay. I don't know why I wrote it this way. First one is just to... Hold on. I think I read it wrong. It's a strength save and then a deck save with advantage. So, strength save to avoid being pulled in. He slams his cleavers into the ground and you make a deck save with advantage to get out of the way of the second part. Yeah, strength save straight.
Gooch III 01:45:08 X makes a little more.
Karak 01:45:21 Do I get advantage while I'm raging? Right? That hurts. I'm surprised it didn't just show you as a 20.
Barrow Berkshire 01:45:31 20 minus 3. Gooch. No way. You're so little and frail. That's awesome. Awesome. Nice. Yeah. Straight save. All bastards is probably good, right?
Dungeon Master 01:45:31 That's still a nat 20. 27. Safe. It's a DC 17.
Gooch III 01:45:37 The natural 20 minus three. Yeah.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:45:41 Minus 20 minus 3. Wait, this was, I'm sorry, strength check? Strength save.
Dungeon Master 01:45:58 Gooch, you succeed automatically with a nat 20, though. Pharaoh fails, Karak succeeds, Alabaster succeeds, Tortimus succeeds. So you are not pulled in. Those who fail take 3d8 damage. That's the next part. The next part is separate. Ooh, 15 and that exploded.
Karak 01:46:06 Ooh, everybody flexing. Everybody's flexing.
Barrow Berkshire 01:46:06 Just me? Thanks. He noticed.
Gooch III 01:46:13 Fuck, don't they get to roll dexterity to see if they take the damage or they just take the damage? Oh, gotcha. You had to bring it up.
Dungeon Master 01:46:31 18 points of damage to those who failed, and then everybody give me the deck save with advantage. Yes. Natural 20.
Barrow Berkshire 01:46:40 being fucked I'm gonna save so far that's alright if she pulled me with that am I still prone noted
Alabaster Leatherback 01:46:43 Advantage, okay. Two sevens.
Gooch III 01:46:54 Nice 20. And we're rolling hot.
Karak 01:46:56 Steve.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:47:00 This 3020.
Barrow Berkshire 01:47:09 You too, sir.
Dungeon Master 01:47:10 21 23 20 so only alabaster fails everybody takes half damage so you all take uh eight points of damage nine points of damage eight eight no eight and then 17 it is uh first one is force damage second one is bludgeoning damage
Alabaster Leatherback 01:47:22 I would take more, right? I would take 18. 14.
Karak 01:47:25 What kind of damage? And I take less bludgeoning damage. And would I take half of that for being raging right now? So four.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:47:32 Sir, tort has... Yeah. Tort also has evasion.
Dungeon Master 01:47:36 And you were pushed 15 feet away. So you all come in and then you explode outward. Everybody goes 15 feet back. Yeah, you would. Did you succeed? Yeah, nothing happened. It's always round down on damage. Give yourself the benefit.
Gooch III 01:47:52 I think with evasion I just miss all of it.
Karak 01:47:56 Jonathan, do you run that four and a half over down? Okay.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:48:10 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:48:11 Maybe it's too complicated. But that's all three legendary actions on one big go. As you guys are brought in and exploded outward. After that, it is Alabaster.
Gooch III 01:48:25 brought in.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:48:26 Oh, you thought you could take me on? And with that, I'm just going to take a slicing blow with the Ivory's Edge. Roll to hit. 21 to hit. Okay, and then let's see. Looks like for this one, do you see succession?
Dungeon Master 01:48:43 21 hits. Okay.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:48:52 Thank you.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:48:58 And then I'm going to go ahead and use one of its special abilities to roll a d20 instead of a 2d6 for that strike. Was it average? It's been so long.
Dungeon Master 01:49:12 So far, this has proved to be exactly average. Prove yourself wrong. Yes, you were rolling very normal numbers on damage. You still had your modifier and everything. How did you explode on it? Do you move back in to get to him?
Alabaster Leatherback 01:49:23 Uh, it's been so low. Yeah. Uh, so four, yes. 13 damage on that. Yeah. All right. And then I'll take another. What's that? Uh, 30 feet.
Gooch III 01:49:33 I was thinking that. Yeah, because he got thrown.
Dungeon Master 01:49:43 What does Alabaster's movement speed? 30, so half your move to get up is 15. You would technically be... No, you'd be 15 feet. Yeah, you'd be right on him. 30 feet's perfect. Yeah.
Barrow Berkshire 01:49:47 Yeah, it's got to take half to get it. The map is big.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:49:53 I'm standing right next to him, aren't I? I have my movement to get up. I guess maybe this map is a little deceptive. I thought I was, like, right on top of him. Oh, got it. Got it, got it.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:49:57 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:50:13 No, I had you 15 feet away. If you drag your token and you have the measurement on, it'll tell you the distance that you move. You were over there. You have the movement, so you can get right up into his face. If you had 25, you'd just be short, but I'm pretty sure your sword has extra range when you do this anyway.
Karak 01:50:18 Everybody's got. Yeah.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:50:28 Oh yeah, and I have to take a d6 to damage. It does. Do I not have enough range to just do a regular strike? Got it. Yeah. Turned out to be.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:50:32 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:50:45 You could, but I was saying that even if you were 10 feet away, you could still hit him. Okay. 2d4 plus 2.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:50:52 I'm going to mess with that one. And then with my bonus action, I will do the minor heal thing. What was that? What's a minor healing potion? God, some low rolls tonight. Six. Okay, now it's my turn.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:51:09 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:51:21 Six to hit? Oh, no, six to heal. I was like, that's not good. Okay. Gooch, the third.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:51:24 No, no, I rolled a 12 to hit. That was pretty bad. I took six heels.
Gooch III 01:51:38 All right, Nate. I'm going to move around here. And since I'm flanking, oh, I had ruler on. I'm going to make an attack with advantage. 28. All right.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:51:41 you you
Dungeon Master 01:51:56 Go for it. 28 hits, obviously.
Barrow Berkshire 01:52:08 Oh, here we go. Fucking exploding dice incoming. Yeah. This one.
Gooch III 01:52:12 So that's going to be nine piercing damage. And then I'm going to use my sneak attack. Where is that? Here we go. All right. So I get one of those or two of them? OK.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:52:30 There's a six.
Dungeon Master 01:52:31 Nice. Okay, go ahead. Yeah, so when you roll a lot of dice at once, you roll one extra one. You just have a greater chance of hitting it. So you're at 19 plus... Come on, explode again for him. Okay, 22, 21, 22. Okay.
Gooch III 01:52:42 Okay, so 19 plus... All right. And then, so yeah, so I'll shift over, trying to get into position, and then my dad and son will be kind of behind me. I'll be like, go, stay over there. Then I'll run over, and I'll just like...
Alabaster Leatherback 01:52:57 No.
Gooch III 01:53:11 Start stabbing him right in the knee. I got one more attack. That's fair. I, uh...
Karak 01:53:15 Tune in again.
Dungeon Master 01:53:16 Right in the joint. He's so large. After your turn, it's Tortimus. Tortimus Staggerfin. How do you want to talk to this dude? Ouch. When you take a mid-turn pause to put your grandparents away, like, it's... I thought you were done. 28 to the air. 28 to the air.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:53:29 I'm going to take a swig, run at him, and swing at him with my claws. That's damage.
Barrow Berkshire 01:53:35 Yeah.
Gooch III 01:53:39 They come over for a second time, and I shoot them away again. I just...
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:53:59 I rolled the wrong one. 26. Okay, 14 damage. Then I'm going to Flurry of Blows. I get to do that twice now. Or three times now, I mean.
Dungeon Master 01:54:04 26 hits. You guys are rolling so high that I can't even use his ability. You're just fucking bypassing everything. You say 14 damage? Yeah. Hell yeah. What of it?
Barrow Berkshire 01:54:10 Yeah. You're using Wolverine claws. Are they made out of shell or like metal?
Gooch III 01:54:30 Nice. Nice.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:54:31 They're metal. It's attached onto my claws. OK, 15, 24, and a 19.
Barrow Berkshire 01:54:39 Okay. There. Three. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:54:52 15 misses, 24 hits, 19 hits, but he's going to use his ability that he's been sitting on, which is just a reaction. He parries you with his snout, and as part of his reaction, he's going to make one attack against you. But roll your damage for the other ones as you guys exchange blows. And he only rolls a 14, so you kind of
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:55:15 OK. Oh, the 19. So he parried the 19? Is that what happened? OK. So one of those hit. OK.
Dungeon Master 01:55:22 We'll describe it in a second. Because you hit a lot of times. 13 damage. Any of those explode? Yeah, one of them did. Yeah, so he parried the 19. It'll be the 10 that hit. That exploded anyway, so you can roll another 10.
Barrow Berkshire 01:55:38 Yeah. Nice. That's awesome.
Karak 01:55:45 Nice. Nice.
Gooch III 01:55:51 Nice.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:55:51 Shit. Boy. 18. Okay, and wait. Flurry of Blows is... Okay, my bonus action. Okay, so I still have one more regular attack. Right? Yep.
Dungeon Master 01:56:00 All right. 15 damage. Make it back up. Yes, you do. Yeah. You guys are fucking crazy. Yeah. Hold on.
Barrow Berkshire 01:56:16 I love putting the bonus action in the middle of the two. Unless he does the thing again.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:56:23 19, so that hits. Unless he parries. Cool. I'm going to stunning strike this fucker. Nine more damage. And now he needs to do a con check, or save.
Dungeon Master 01:56:30 It might just be for that. Against the triggering attack. So it's just that one time. 19 hits.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:56:46 Nice.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:56:56 14 dc didn't he say he's really yeah he's good at calling he saved all right and then wait how do what is this this way
Barrow Berkshire 01:56:59 Can't imagine this guy's con is low. It's pretty good.
Dungeon Master 01:56:59 25. He is good at conning.
Gooch III 01:57:09 You need to make an amendment.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:57:28 Okay, no, we're good. Happy.
Dungeon Master 01:57:33 Okay. Barrow, following that up. It's your go. Yeah. One of them. But it's still doubled. Just double the number. So it's like
Barrow Berkshire 01:57:39 I have one clarifying question. If an exploding dice happens on a crit, roll two of them or one of them? Okay. That's what I mean. Like, do we roll two dice on the crit or we just double the number? Okay. Well, I mean, it's her game.
Karak 01:57:50 wants to rule. We roll double dice.
Dungeon Master 01:58:03 Well, I mean, it depends on how you roll crits, because you can pick one as long as you're consistent or whatever. Like, when I roll my crits, I just double the dice. Other people, you roll the same dice and just double the damage. Whatever you do. So, like, exploding dice, if you're... So if you roll double dice, you're rolling one extra. So it'd be three dice tripled instead of two dice doubled.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:58:03 Thank you.
Barrow Berkshire 01:58:17 I tend to double. All right. Tripled. Let's see what you said.
Karak 01:58:24 Two more. Okay. Okay. I like that. That's like a brutal critical.
Dungeon Master 01:58:34 wait yeah you get yeah it's like an extra damage dice that doubles instead of just doubling the damage of two dice that's what i mean okay
Barrow Berkshire 01:58:47 Yeah. Okay, cool. I am going to take half my movement and get up. And then I'm going to throw my Axe of Returning, not at the big fucker, but at Belly over here, whatever the hell his name is, or Brat. And I'm going to huck it at him. He's just out of my short range, but he's in my long range. So is that with disadvantage?
Dungeon Master 01:59:05 Yeah, but you can still do it. Oh, shit.
Barrow Berkshire 01:59:17 Okay. Yeah, yeah. No, that's fine. So I'm going to huck it at him. Under my leg, I'm going to say, fuck you, Tortimus. Check what I can do. Learned this in ranger school. And I fucking crit on his ass, motherfucker. No, I'm just kidding. I had disadvantage. I had disadvantage, so the crit... I rolled it with advantage, but I didn't mean to roll it with advantage. It was with disadvantage.
Karak 01:59:20 Oh, shit.
Gooch III 01:59:27 We feel that.
Alabaster Leatherback 01:59:32 Nice.
Tortimus Staggerfin 01:59:35 You just got that. There's no way you learned that in school. You just found that.
Dungeon Master 01:59:46 It's 3 plus 7, not 20 plus 7. But you still fly towards them. Yeah.
Barrow Berkshire 01:59:48 which sucks so it was a 10 and I missed that would have been cool um right so it like lands next to him and it stuck me right to him right where I threw it from so I'm fucking like a triangle like a conehead baby that gets like morphed as it comes out I'm like fucking like in a triangle shape of speed
Karak 01:59:50 That's a bummer.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:00:09 Thank you.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:00:12 Whoa.
Barrow Berkshire 02:00:13 coming at this pig. Fuck you, dude. And I come in, and then I beat that and pull out. I'm two-handed, actually. So I have my prickle in my hand, and I try to hit him with that. Please, dude. 15. All right. So 15. Prickle is a little thick of a sword.
Dungeon Master 02:00:32 If you crit again. 15. 15 hits him. Yeah. 6 damage.
Barrow Berkshire 02:00:43 And I swing it so fast that it looks even smaller than it is. So part of it disappears, and it looks like there's a bad hit box on a video game. It looks like it didn't even hit him, but they recoil. It's fixed damage. And then my swarm I can use when I hit on a turn for a free action to do another D8. So I'll do that. So my flies can lean in and bite him with teeth.
Dungeon Master 02:01:05 Mm-hmm. Nice. The fuck's in a horse flies? Or do they have, like, buck human-ish teeth, but, like, really small? Oh. Uh-huh.
Barrow Berkshire 02:01:18 buck human teeth for sure that's been damaged from my flies they did more than me okay last thing and then I use hidden step which is a ranger ability so my flies like fucking fly around me and I turn invisible as a bonus action and then I use my my speed is 20 so I use my last 20 feet to like back away from while I'm invisible
Gooch III 02:01:24 Woo-hoo!
Dungeon Master 02:01:36 Here you go. Okay. Normally he would get an attack with disadvantage, but being this still in the first round is not acting due to the intimidation.
Barrow Berkshire 02:01:55 That's fine. Oh, let's go. Oh, no.
Gooch III 02:02:02 Nice. That guy's the worst.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:02:03 Oh yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:02:04 After that, it is his turn. You see him still looking frantic. He's the one with the short mohawk, medium build. On his face, you see a very intricate and detailed sigil start to glow and burn into his skin. And you see his eyes roll backwards, and he readies his weapon, but he doesn't act on this turn. Back up to the top, however.
Barrow Berkshire 02:02:32 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:02:35 It is Belly. Belly is pissed about taking all of that damage, Gooch. He lets out a howl, and he starts to shake violently, and you see those sort of quills sticking out of his back, those really large bristles.
Gooch III 02:02:45 on me.
Dungeon Master 02:02:57 get launched into the sky and arc down. He picks up to 10 adjacent 5-foot cubes within 60 feet, and each creature must succeed on a deck save. So he'll go... He'll go... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. He just misses Alabaster, but he will get any line out of the sky. Tortimus...
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:02:58 you
Barrow Berkshire 02:03:06 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:03:27 Gooch, and starting at Carrick. Each of you give a deck saving throw as you get rained down upon by these enormous bristles. Doesn't Tortoise have evasion? Yeah.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:03:39 i do have vision that's only if i pass so i guess i take half damage no matter what damn weird cannot save on this guy
Gooch III 02:03:43 Maybe 14. Mm hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:03:57 So 17 was the save. That is three fails. No, you can't. When he rolls a save against you and you guys roll a save against him, it fucks you. That's okay. He rolled 17 damage and one of them exploded.
Karak 02:04:01 That was tough. That was tough. Oh, wait. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to hit that button. It's a bummer. I think it's as shield master, don't I add my shield to my deck save?
Dungeon Master 02:04:31 Yes, and if you succeed, it's like evasion. So that's 21 points of damage if you failed. And 10 if you succeeded. It was a DC 17. So if you hit 17 with your shield bonus, which I don't think it does. Oh, you hit 15. So you get right to 17 then.
Karak 02:04:34 Right, so I think, what is it? Yeah, it's plus 15, yeah, 17, yeah. Correct.
Barrow Berkshire 02:04:35 Okay.
Gooch III 02:04:57 Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:05:00 Okay, so then you hit it and I think you take no damage. Like an Elden Ring dodge. You just sort of perfectly dodge through his attack animation and take zero damage from the quills as everybody else sort of gets just pegged like a hundred times with these little thorns. But that is his whole action economy for that. So after that, it'll be Carrick's turn.
Karak 02:05:30 um i am i'm am i prone right now how did that play out i was on the ground there we all got i i succeeded so i just got pushed back 15. okay great uh i'm gonna use
Dungeon Master 02:05:39 Did you fail to save or did you succeed it? Yeah, it pushed back 15, but not pro. Okay. Just abused.
Karak 02:05:55 all 40 feet to fly up and do the similar attack where again i just fall out of the sky and try to add that under damage just coming down oh this is with advantage so the first one person's 19 to hit
Gooch III 02:06:08 button masher doing it
Barrow Berkshire 02:06:10 You gotta. You absolutely gotta. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.
Dungeon Master 02:06:19 Yeah, and as a barbarian, you can reckless attack whenever you choose. You can attack with advantage, but they just get advantage back on you. Perfect. Yeah, that hits for sure.
Karak 02:06:26 That's exactly what I was trying to do the first time. So it's 19 and 27. So they hit. It hits, whatever. Let's see if these go. There we go. One of the D6s did it.
Dungeon Master 02:06:53 18. Elia, 18 plus. One, nice.
Karak 02:07:02 Another three. 21. That's a great hit. Second attack. I'll just, so after landing on him, I'll roll off to the side here and do second attack. 17.
Gooch III 02:07:07 Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:07:28 17 would hit but he's going to use his reaction further round and parry that he's going to make one cleaver attack on you and then at this point it is coming up now because he has officially taken enough damage to take him down to 126 hp he enters frenzy mode you see
Karak 02:07:36 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:07:49 When he parries you, he pulls his cleaver out of the ground, and sticking to it are like rocks that are held aloft in the actual scene. He's going to hold the thing down on you, and he'll just do a little bit more damage. Wow, that's a 25 to hit.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:07:51 Thank you.
Barrow Berkshire 02:08:09 Hmm.
Karak 02:08:12 That definitely hits. 11. Okay, but that is piercing, stabbing, whatever, so half-t.
Dungeon Master 02:08:21 He gets an extra D10. Oh, wow. Oh, she passes modifier. That is 16 points of damage. That's not a lot. He does bludgeoning, actually, with how big his weapons are. So you'll half it every time.
Karak 02:08:45 So, yeah, so eight. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:08:53 Perfect. And then after your turn, he's going to use a legendary action. Does he have one that's just... Yeah, he's going to use two legendary actions and use Spiraling Deathbore. He launches into a spiraling charge straight in a straight line. So he'll just go... Well, that's not great, actually.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:09:14 Ooh.
Dungeon Master 02:09:27 He can go up to 60 feet. He goes right past you two. So he'll go after Carrick and Barrow. Give me a deck save. And it doesn't say he doesn't take attacks of opportunity. So the four of you could attack him. Yeah.
Barrow Berkshire 02:09:37 I'm invisible. Dexy.
Karak 02:09:47 for each. Dex save first. Print two.
Dungeon Master 02:09:59 1 and 2 succeeds. This is an all or nothing thing, so you take no damage when you dodge. 13 fails, but you'll take half because of evasion. Oh, that's your attack. Never mind. 13 doesn't hit, though. Barrel 13 does not succeed. So you'll take damage.
Barrow Berkshire 02:10:23 That makes sense. 40, 10. I'm getting fucked.
Dungeon Master 02:10:30 This is bludgeoning damage and you are knocked prone. That is 25 and he exploded once. You take 26 points of damage. Yes, and then go ahead and roll your opportunity attack against him.
Karak 02:10:38 Can we roll, do you want us to roll the opportunity attacks? That was a miss.
Barrow Berkshire 02:10:48 I went over here to not fucking die. It's not working.
Dungeon Master 02:10:59 Ferrick misses. Portimus missed. Gooch gets to attack. This is Jesse. Is Jesse there? Yeah.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:11:21 We can't hear you, Jesse. Yep.
Gooch III 02:11:24 There we go. Sorry. Can you hear me? Okay. Would this be with advantage because of where he was when he would have left?
Karak 02:11:24 Yeah, there you go. Yep. Opportunity attack. Okay. Oh, yeah.
Barrow Berkshire 02:11:27 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:11:28 Did you say anything? No, you're up next. This is his legendary action, but you get to make an opportunity attack against him. You are... Yeah. In fact, everybody with Roll of Advantage. So if you missed and you didn't Roll of Advantage...
Alabaster Leatherback 02:11:28 Oh, wait, hold on. Did I, did I miss my turn? Oh, it's got it. I'm tracking. Oh, okay.
Karak 02:11:57 19, 19 hits. Woo. Woo.
Gooch III 02:11:57 Natural 20.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:11:59 Yeah. Alright. I'm going to use my second charge here. I'm going to roll a d20. Fuck it. Big money. Hey! Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:11:59 Metro 20 for a 30. That's the first 30 I've seen in this, I think, campaign. 27, 20. He already used his reaction, so he can't parry. Everybody hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:12:06 30, 20.
Karak 02:12:29 It's not bad. Question modifier. Did someone reroll?
Alabaster Leatherback 02:12:30 yeah that's that's that's better so plus four so 20 damage and then i'm gonna go ahead and add a um that's my oh i took max damage though good thing i used my bonus
Dungeon Master 02:12:31 16. Jesse, you crit on a sneak attack damage, by the way? The roll double on everything. Anybody who exploded roll extra damage. Give me all the big numbers.
Gooch III 02:12:49 Oh, okay.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:12:50 Holy shit. There's a six. Yep.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:13:07 I'm going to do a third level smite on this bitch. Which means, what is that going to add? 5d8. Hell yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:13:11 Mining. Okay. Fourth level, 5d8. 5d8 extra. 53. 16.
Gooch III 02:13:29 I did 53 total. Actually, it's 59. It's 59.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:13:35 Let's see.
Karak 02:13:36 That's ridiculous. If you click the number, it'll show you that has a dice roll and you can read the numbers or stare at the dice. Yeah.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:13:37 I don't think any of those were eights. How do you look at the Yeah, but they like, oh, if I go to the dot dot dot. Yeah, got it. I was gonna say they cut off but yeah, another 16 damage.
Dungeon Master 02:13:42 Just hover over it. None of them exploded. You're right. Jesse, what'd you say? Yeah.
Gooch III 02:13:59 Oh, it's actually 59, because when I did the crit damage on my dagger, it was 1d4 plus 6, but it did 2d4 plus 6 instead of 2d4 plus 12. Yeah. Me? Oh, yeah. Yeah, no. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:14:12 Got you at 75 total then. 75 total in the round then. Not for you. No, no, for both. And then everybody else hit two, right? What did I miss? Eight, okay.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:14:29 Yeah, I rolled all my damage.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:14:34 Yeah, I did, I think I did eight, yeah. Eight damage. Jesus.
Dungeon Master 02:14:44 Perfect. Okay. That was a big hit. That was 83 points of damage on that. As part of his spiraling death boar thing, he goes again. So he's going to charge directly back. And he gets to there. One more time. Run it back. 60 feet. Give him that straight line.
Karak 02:14:59 Excellent.
Barrow Berkshire 02:15:02 He gets to there by running?
Alabaster Leatherback 02:15:11 Oh, he came back?
Dungeon Master 02:15:14 He goes twice. Deck save, yeah. He's looking hurt right now, though. Yep. Everybody who he goes back over
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:15:17 So what was this roll again? A dex save? 30-20.
Gooch III 02:15:23 For who? Do I need to make one as well? OK, that's me too. This is minus 2. This is minus 2.
Barrow Berkshire 02:15:33 For everybody? For the love of God, dude. I failed every single one so far.
Karak 02:15:35 And we're in that line. Definitely a goose. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:15:46 Success, success. Doesn't matter, 28 success. 14 does not. You guys are going to have to bring back Barrow. 25 points of damage.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:15:53 Unleash it. Unleash the torch section.
Gooch III 02:15:59 yeah you and Tortimus I think my oh yeah
Barrow Berkshire 02:16:02 I'm getting butt fucked. Yeah, I'm going to be down.
Karak 02:16:05 Don't you have some potions? Didn't you have potions in your inventory? And didn't everybody decide that each turn you can rip a heal? Isn't that a thing right now? Right, but that's everybody's bonus action right now, is a regular healing potion. Correct? Yeah. Use it. Use it.
Dungeon Master 02:16:19 It just hasn't been his turn yet. He's sort of towards the end. Yeah. Which is helpful.
Gooch III 02:16:31 Oh shit. Yeah. Can't see me.
Barrow Berkshire 02:16:36 I use my bonus section to go invisible. It wasn't, apparently. I've been hit by fucking 50 damage since.
Karak 02:16:39 I got you. I got you. Get that bonus. Get that sneak attack damage. Since going invisible. It's going to fall.
Dungeon Master 02:16:50 Yeah. Alabaster. Well, he didn't even know you were there. He just goes 60 feet. And that's the only line he had.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:16:53 My turn. Okay, I'm gonna move in. Oh, you're down? Yeah, Dr. Feelgood was gonna take care of you.
Gooch III 02:17:04 Hmm. Yeah. Don't worry. We got Gooch coming to help you. He's going to rub you, make you feel good. Yeah.
Barrow Berkshire 02:17:05 I am down right away. Yeah. Yeah, I was at 22 health.
Karak 02:17:09 Or you went down? You went down? I have you as still...
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:17:12 yeah gooch section our little the other gooch's have potions too
Alabaster Leatherback 02:17:28 Okay, well, if Gooch is going to make that happen, I'm going to move in and close in the difference and just kind of stampede full storm with my longsword here and come in hot. Oh, nat 20, baby.
Gooch III 02:17:54 Nice.
Karak 02:17:54 Yeah, double roll your damage. And then double your model time.
Dungeon Master 02:17:55 Ah, 20. Nice. Yep. Either roll two of the damage dice or roll the damage dice and double it.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:17:58 So we're double rolling, or I guess roll as crit damage. I'll just roll these. So that's two, and then... All right, so 21 on that hit.
Dungeon Master 02:18:25 21. And it's double modifier, too. But that already happened with you doubled it. Perfect. 21. 13 misses, though.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:18:30 Oh, yeah. 13 misses, and then I guess this is a bonus action. So is this potion something that I can give to somebody else, or it's only self-administered? Oh, he's way over there. I can't do it.
Dungeon Master 02:18:49 Self-administered. Everybody has actual potions, so you could administer one of your actual ones, or you could use... No, you used your action already, so you can't do lay on hands. You can use one of your actual potions if you wanted. You can smite on anything, yeah. On your crit? Yeah, you should have smited on that.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:19:03 Okay, can I use a smite on that attack that hit? Is it too late? Okay. Yeah, on the crit, right? Yeah. 10 to eight. Yeah, that's insane. That's a lot.
Barrow Berkshire 02:19:18 Yeah, you should do that. I can see all of them.
Dungeon Master 02:19:18 So roll 10d8. Yeah, there's no reason you shouldn't use that. That's okay. All you need is one. 47 plus another d8.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:19:33 That's at least one, only one exploded, I think, or maybe. Yikes. That's a big smite. 52. Yeah.
Gooch III 02:19:37 Two of them. Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:19:48 Five more. 53 points of damage. You go to finish him with one massive swipe. You cleave into him, setting him into phase two. He lets out a harrowing howl as he launches into the sky like a meteor going backwards. He breaks through the roof, and there is a full round of reprieve. Everybody do what you would do.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:19:49 All right.
Dungeon Master 02:20:15 If you had one round of something, but you still felt like something was coming, you're not resting yet. You have the sensation. This isn't over. Rod is still there yet.
Barrow Berkshire 02:20:24 I'm down. That's my action. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh. Holy hell.
Gooch III 02:20:26 Isn't there a whole other dude over there? Yeah. Can I send my dad over to help him? Or somebody faster?
Karak 02:20:26 feed a potion to Barrow. Oh, come on, man. Why are you taking a break? Get up.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:20:40 Uh, I'm going to do the lay hands, uh, pool. I'm going to, I'm going to heal. Uh, I've got 50 points to give out, I guess. Well, yeah, I was just thinking, I don't know if I can get over there.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:20:48 Just lovely. Jesus.
Karak 02:20:54 Yeah, just dump him on, dump him on Barrow. And tort, little, little, little for tort.
Barrow Berkshire 02:20:57 Oh. Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:20:58 You can dump as many or as little as you want. To give you an idea of what will happen, you see that there is like a light flickering in the sky of the Astral Sea, and it's getting a little bit brighter and a little bit larger, and you put together pretty quickly, like an asteroid falling from the sky, he is descending upon you. So he's coming in hot, whatever you're going to do. So you're going to Healing Hands Barrow,
Gooch III 02:21:25 Yeah, hit something. Hit yourself. I'm going to
Barrow Berkshire 02:21:27 How much health do I get? How much health do I get from the healing word thing or healing hands or whatever?
Dungeon Master 02:21:27 What is Portimus, Karak, and Gooch doing? Okay. Make an attack on Bra, if you want.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:21:32 Yep.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:21:32 Yeah, save your potion. Well, I guess you give a potion. I'm going to give you 50. I'm going to give you all 50. I give you 50. Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Karak 02:21:33 If this counts as a round loss, I'd like to be raging when he lands.
Dungeon Master 02:21:55 He did his lay on hands and he gave you all 50.
Barrow Berkshire 02:21:59 50. Holy hell. No. What is that? I apologize. Okay. I'm going to add two still. So six.
Karak 02:22:00 And then whatever you rolled, did you roll for your basic healing potion? 2d4 plus 2 plus 50. That's a bummer. Okay.
Gooch III 02:22:07 Yeah, 2D4 plus 2. Or is it 1D4 plus 1?
Alabaster Leatherback 02:22:09 And then as a bonus action, I'm going to take the 2d four plus plus two. Yeah. Damn. That's exactly what I got last time. Actually, that's lower.
Dungeon Master 02:22:26 That's unfortunate. Everybody do their free round.
Karak 02:22:33 56, that's not bad. It's back. It's back. Yeah, I'm going to bonus action Rage. Let's see what we get.
Barrow Berkshire 02:22:34 Okay. I'm doing fine. That was fine. Thanks. Holy shit. The biggest fucking paddles on my chest electrocuting me.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:22:38 Yeah, we're the same. We're back equal.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:22:44 Nice. You know
Gooch III 02:22:45 I'm going to take the dodge action. Oh, I'm holding an action then? Is that what you're thinking? Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:22:52 You shouldn't do that, Jesse, because once you resume, we'll resume back in your turn. So if you take a dodge action, you're not doing anything. Right, because it's going to resume initiative. He doesn't just get to skip back to the top. He died for second phase two during Alabaster's turn. You all get one round to do something, and then it's back in initiative order. So I'm just letting you know, don't waste Gooch's turn on dodging.
Gooch III 02:23:18 Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well then I'll just, I'll, I'll wait. Oh, I'm, I'm full. I guess, um, Gooch, Gooch the fourth. I took, uh, I took tough.
Barrow Berkshire 02:23:20 I'm fucking dead and this dude hasn't been hit and I ran away I literally ran away from that person it's unbelievable
Dungeon Master 02:23:24 You're not going to do anything? No healing or anything? You're going to fall? Jesus. Okay, never mind. I didn't realize you hadn't taken any damage yet. I just assumed. Sorry. That's me. That's on me. I thought you could do it. That's so nice.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:23:35 laughing
Alabaster Leatherback 02:23:36 Yeah. He also has a hundred. I don't understand how your health is so much higher than mine. Okay. Makes sense.
Gooch III 02:23:47 It gave me an extra 22 hit points taking tough. I guess I'll just gooch the fourth while you keep trying to show me his trading cards. Fuck off, dude. I'm trying to fight right now. Get out of here. I don't care. I don't care. I don't get your generation. I'm trying to work.
Dungeon Master 02:23:58 No, you don't understand. It's a Celebi EX Shiny, dude. It's full art. Gooch the second goes, who? Who? Gooch the second is sneaking into the corner.
Barrow Berkshire 02:24:10 Goose the fourth says dude. Or Goose the second. It's got no defects. Oh. Oh. Oh.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:24:12 Dude, you have to grade that. You have to. Who?
Gooch III 02:24:19 You're supposed to be healing Barrow. What are you doing? You're not even helping. That guy. The guy's fucking dead. I'll hold an action, I guess, if it's going to go by to attack. He's still not here?
Dungeon Master 02:24:32 Okay, everybody does their thing. Back into order. Gooch, it's your turn. No, he's got to come back on his turn. That's what I was trying to tell you. Don't waste your turn doing nothing.
Gooch III 02:24:52 Yeah, I'll just move over here and I'll throw a dagger at him. I'll use my bonus action to give myself advantage. I also have Savage Attacker, which I've been forgetting to use.
Barrow Berkshire 02:24:58 There's still a guy way over there. Wow. Wow.
Dungeon Master 02:25:09 16 hits him. How do you have so many feats? Good for you.
Gooch III 02:25:25 I got like three of them. All right. So nine and then sneak attack. I'm going to reroll to see if I get a better sneak attack. Okay. Yeah. So I think it's just the sneak attack.
Barrow Berkshire 02:25:41 You can do that? Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:25:44 I think it's the... Is it the sneak attack or is it the entire attack? Like, is it the damage from your weapon or... I don't know. Nice. Finish Brock. Yeah. Yeah.
Gooch III 02:25:56 It might just be weapon. So that'd be 24. So it'd be 9 plus 24. So, 33. Finish him? He's dead? I... I...
Barrow Berkshire 02:26:11 oh my god I'm literally still invisible by the way
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:26:13 Oh.
Karak 02:26:14 Good minion. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:26:15 He's taken a surprising amount of damage. It's just been in the background. I love that they're not even giving you the invisibility. It's just no matter what, you're there.
Gooch III 02:26:19 I finally just throw the cards back at Gooch IV, and I say, I gotta go. I cross, and I throw the knife. It bounces off of Barrow, and it slices right into this guy's thigh.
Barrow Berkshire 02:26:41 Perfect. No, it's only when I do damage, attack, or make someone do a saving throw. That's all stuff I do. Yeah, I've gone down, gotten picked up, and had my belly reflect something. Just all of this. Perfect.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:26:46 Well, you got hit. Doesn't it go down when you get hit? Or take damage? Oh, shit. We've never noticed. It's so cool, but we just didn't see. Alright. Well, I'm going to run back.
Dungeon Master 02:26:50 I don't think it specifies that. It's just funny that they're using him in combat. Gordimus, it's your turn. Your turn proper.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:27:16 Well, big boy's still in the air, is he not? Well, I guess I'll get like here. I guess I'll move down a little bit, I guess. I can't really do anything. Yep. That'd be me.
Barrow Berkshire 02:27:20 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:27:21 Yeah, he's coming down hot though.
Gooch III 02:27:26 Oh, I guess I should have moved back.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:27:52 This fucker's still there. Sure.
Karak 02:28:00 you
Gooch III 02:28:01 and hold an action, right?
Dungeon Master 02:28:04 Okay. Okay. Holding your action, waiting for him to come down and attack. Pharaoh, it is your turn.
Barrow Berkshire 02:28:19 Okay. Um, I can't imagine he's within 90 feet for a hunter's mark. Just can't imagine that's true. Really? 100 Morgan.
Karak 02:28:34 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:28:34 mechanically speaking he is exactly 90 feet away flavor wise he was farther but he is 90 feet away from you in the air
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:28:44 you
Barrow Berkshire 02:28:50 I'm just as a bonus action. I'm still invisible. I'm just gonna kind of back away from the group. And I suppose I will hold the natural who
Dungeon Master 02:29:07 Okay. You are the end of initiative, which means that at the end of the round, your held action expires. So you can choose to do something else if your held action doesn't come to term. So the two people who held their action, you can do something else because he's not here at the end of the round. He comes back on his turn and he's at the top of initiatives.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:29:14 Yeah.
Barrow Berkshire 02:29:20 I don't have any actions. I don't think
Dungeon Master 02:29:36 So you hold your attack. He doesn't come. What do you do next? Do you want to, you can bonus action heal if you want, if you're still down.
Barrow Berkshire 02:29:49 Like, used, it's not. Yeah, I just don't. Okay, I'll use the bonus action, like, minor healing potion or whatever you have. That'll be me.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:30:16 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:30:32 The most he can get is three in a row. On his turn, he plummets out of the sky, and when he crashes into the ground, each creature in the crash zone must give me an additional deck save. So that's just Karak, Gooch, Alabaster, and did any of you three hold your action before?
Barrow Berkshire 02:30:44 Yeah.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:30:55 Thank you.
Karak 02:31:02 I bonus action just to stay. I bonus action just to stay raging. Plus two. It's come in handy.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:31:03 I think I used mine, didn't I? Damn. Damn roll tonight.
Dungeon Master 02:31:06 Yeah, I believe you did. Okay. So go ahead and give me those deck saves. 15 is a fail. 15 plus two, 17. That 17 might do it, actually.
Dungeon Master 02:31:35 It's an 18. DC 18 save. Goose the third succeeds, and because it's a deck save, you take zero damage. Otherwise, everybody who gets hit takes a significant...
Alabaster Leatherback 02:31:35 Bye.
Karak 02:31:37 Oh, it's a mess.
Gooch III 02:31:38 I do a Trinity from the Matrix style.
Barrow Berkshire 02:31:48 has been hit gucci third is fucking unbelievable just dodging everything coming at him holy shit
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:31:53 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:32:06 48 points of bludgeoning damage. Yeah, that would have been nice.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:32:06 Oh, geez. Really wish I hadn't rolled a three on my hit die. Paladin is so squishy.
Gooch III 02:32:07 Jesus Christ.
Karak 02:32:12 Okay, that's better. That's better. I can swallow that.
Barrow Berkshire 02:32:18 better than 90 on the max though. What?
Gooch III 02:32:38 Well, it's all these AOEs, dude. Your AC is so high. Just so many AOEs. Please no.
Dungeon Master 02:32:42 Yeah, it's not an attack roll. This guy's just built all on jumping around and crashing and does shit. Health, yes. What's your calling score? It doesn't help either. Okay, and if you failed the deck save, which was...
Barrow Berkshire 02:32:47 I'll instill what, a D10? It must just not have rolled well either. Yeah.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:32:51 Yeah. D10, yeah. 2, yeah, plus 2. 14. Damn.
Dungeon Master 02:33:09 Karak and Alabaster, you are not prone again. But after that, it is Karak's turn. You see, he looks vehemently wild. His spikes are bigger. His swords have all of this energy coming off of him. He's got rage coming out of his eyeballs. He looks temporarily buffed in this state.
Karak 02:33:14 I will.
Dungeon Master 02:33:36 You don't know how long it'll last for, if he's going to die afterwards. But he's definitely not at full. He didn't reset.
Karak 02:33:47 That's great. I'm going to move forward and go ahead and take my action. So first two attacks, and then I think I'll use my swords feature and do my bonus action third attack. This will be three of them. All right. First one. It's going to 30, 20 to hit.
Dungeon Master 02:34:18 20-20 hits. 24 hits. 24 hits. Roll that damage.
Karak 02:34:20 Second one. 24 to hit. Last one. I'll do that there. 24 to hit.
Gooch III 02:34:43 Nice. Nice. Damn.
Karak 02:34:58 Oh, middle of the road there. That's all right. 27. No, it was close. Seven. One of them. Yeah, the last one had to be reckless. I just made all the reckless.
Dungeon Master 02:35:02 Any maxes? No. Damn. 27 damage. Good. Already starting to show signs of wear again. After your turn, he's going to use a legendary action, however. Seeing that you swung, that was reckless, correct? Correct.
Dungeon Master 02:35:28 He'll do his just basic legendary action, and he can make an attack and then move up to 10 feet. So he's going to swipe at you with advantage. I don't have an advantage for my modified attack, so we'll just see. 21 to hit.
Karak 02:35:51 It is.
Dungeon Master 02:36:07 You take 21 points of bludgeoning damage halved. And it is Alabaster's turn. Mm-hmm.
Gooch III 02:36:09 Helpy Chonk. And feet.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:36:18 And I just kind of hawk out some blood onto the ground and stand up. And I am how far from this guy? Oh, I have enough movement. Yep. And I'll lumber on over and I'll say, it's time for you to pay the price. Like a stampede. I am inevitable.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:36:47 And I'm going to swing my sword. If I can hit this guy. It would be with advantage, yeah? Because I'm flanking. Correct. Excellent. 25 to hit. And...
Karak 02:36:57 Yeah, yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:36:58 Yes, that's correct. Yes, sir.
Gooch III 02:37:09 Nice. Nice.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:37:10 you
Alabaster Leatherback 02:37:14 I'm out of third level smites, but I'll do a second level. So that would be 48. Excellent. So for the regular sword damage, 14 and then 48. Hey, and one of them exploded. Nice. Hey, there it goes, baby.
Dungeon Master 02:37:31 Again. All right. That's what it's all about.
Karak 02:37:37 Here we go, do it again. Do it again. Let's fucking go. 27, 28, yeah.
Gooch III 02:37:46 Oh shit. Still. 42 damage. Oh fuck.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:37:48 add just a one but that was fun. Yeah, so 28 plus the 1440 Yep, exactly. Now I have another strike.
Dungeon Master 02:38:04 I've got it in. He's looking hurt. And because of that, is that the end of your turn? Oh, let's go. Finish him off. Come on. Misses. That is a bummer.
Gooch III 02:38:15 Jesus Christ.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:38:19 Ah, bummer. That one misses. If I call in a bonus or a spiritual weapon, will I be able to use it like this turn? Or is that my next turn? Okay. So for my bonus action, I'll cast spiritual weapon. And would that be with advantage because it's flanking? Or is that just regular?
Dungeon Master 02:38:34 Yeah, it goes. As part of summoning, it makes an attack. Okay. We'll just use Barat. No. There's no way it could get flanking. Your spiritual weapon takes up a full space of movement. It's like a body-sized weapon. Yes. Yes.
Gooch III 02:38:57 This phantom menace. Yes. Nice.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:38:59 Shit. That's it for me. Didn't make it.
Dungeon Master 02:39:02 It's Battle of the Fates epic version. Okay. 11 misses. After that big turn, though, Pissed on his... After your turn, he's going to use two legendary actions, and he's going to do that super annoying charge attack again. Spiral and Death Force. So he's going to go line up,
Karak 02:39:23 All right, so two saves.
Dungeon Master 02:39:31 And then that catches Karak and Gooch. And then he's going to go back. And he just hits back into Alabaster. So Karak and Gooch, you get hit twice. Alabaster, you get hit only on the second one. He's insane.
Barrow Berkshire 02:39:52 Fucking Gooch dude. Oh my god. That's unbelievable.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:39:55 Yeah, dude, this guy. He's a fucking squeaky little guy.
Karak 02:39:56 18. 18. Right, you're still
Dungeon Master 02:40:03 Would you say 18? 18 is exactly what you need. But they're Nat 20s, so it doesn't matter. The first round of damage, anybody who failed takes 40-10.
Gooch III 02:40:10 You know what? Here's something crazy. I'm cursed. So all my saves have been at minus two. So it should be two more. It should be two more than all of these. Crazy.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:40:25 Thank you.
Barrow Berkshire 02:40:25 Okay.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:40:27 13, I'm down.
Dungeon Master 02:40:32 And then on the second one, 13 fails. He only does 13 points of damage on the way back though. Yes, you both can take attacks of opportunity on the way back or on the way in if you would like.
Gooch III 02:40:47 Can I hit him on the way by the first time? I want to do it to keep him from hitting Alabaster twice. Oh, never mind. Never mind. I want to keep him from hitting him at all. That's a natural 20.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:41:03 Oh, I thought he was only hitting me once anyhow. Was he? Oh. How'd you, what did you do?
Dungeon Master 02:41:03 Do you have Sentinel as well? Huh. He used his reaction to hit him as he left the first time, and he crit again, which I think is number five or six. We can roll back the tape in a second.
Karak 02:41:13 That's nice.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:41:14 Jesus.
Gooch III 02:41:30 been a lot. That's going to be nine. That's 15 total for the, and then with the sneak attack damage, which will be crit. It won't let me crit it, so I'm just going to roll it twice. So 20 and 23. And I'll just roll one more. One more d6, even though it's for the double
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:41:47 The six. Jesus.
Barrow Berkshire 02:41:51 You got to roll another one too.
Karak 02:41:53 Yeah, you got one more.
Gooch III 02:41:57 So that's 40, 46 plus 15 is 50, 61. All right. He goes by, and first time I just lean out of the way. Oh, shit.
Dungeon Master 02:42:12 Finish him. How do you want to end this creature before it brings Alabaster down?
Alabaster Leatherback 02:42:14 Nice. Favorite spot.
Gooch III 02:42:27 The next time I wait, and as he goes by, I just catch him right in the back of the knee. He just crumples. That's a lot. That's a lot.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:42:31 One little shink.
Dungeon Master 02:42:42 You have crit six times, in fact. With 55 hit points, you go over that and knock him down. This monstrous creature slides to a halt in front of you guys. Anybody who went down in combat...
Alabaster Leatherback 02:42:45 Jesus. Incredible. Gooch the second and Gooch the fourth didn't even have to do anything.
Dungeon Master 02:43:06 Not that it matters because you made it to the end, but your amber bean person has like a little crack in the amber, but none of them were destroyed. So unless something attacked you, mission success. Preacher's dead. The room falls silent. There's the stained glass starts to sort of twinkle again. The floor just reflects the space above and below you.
Karak 02:43:16 Ooh.
Gooch III 02:43:17 Yeah, I didn't even think about that.
Dungeon Master 02:43:36 And you guys are in this room with this sort of decrepit-looking tree on the right, the throne and the paintings and the skulls and torches. And the only thing that seems like it would be of value were the cleavers. Everything else is unimportant.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:44:02 What the hell happened to that guy? Did you see what he had written on him before he exploded? We had heard, overheard that
Karak 02:44:12 Yeah, I did. I rolled really high. What did that say, Jonathan? Something for the birth? Forth? Or to come forth? Or for birth.
Dungeon Master 02:44:18 It said, right here, four for a birth. And it's got four birds carved in.
Gooch III 02:44:19 And.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:44:31 Somebody had to give up something. One person got punched in the face. This guy presumably got edged. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:44:38 Looking back, this archfey that he talked about from whenever that they met that approached them and gave them this power, gave them this power with the caveat that he could harm them each once. He punched Brott in the face at the spot where that rune popped up, but it never came into play because he died so fast. And then the other two seemingly got off scot-free.
Barrow Berkshire 02:44:47 forms.
Dungeon Master 02:45:01 You saw Belly have something carved into his stomach before he, in one attack, killed Sir Loin. So each of them harmed once for some above-them-masterful plot. If it had come into play, it was a dominate monster.
Karak 02:45:02 Thank you.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:45:17 What was this rune? I didn't capture that. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:45:27 spell coded by like a protection spell so it would have been really hard to break but he was brain controlled by it again never came into play because the successful intimidation kept him from acting and then when he by the time he had a chance to act he died because he was bottom of the initiative so never came up he would have been dominated and under control of the monster
Alabaster Leatherback 02:45:46 But he would have been dominated? Got it.
Dungeon Master 02:45:54 But the monster seems pretty mindless.
Barrow Berkshire 02:46:04 Let's fucking go. Fucking eat shit, Tortimus. What I did was super sick. I might have gone down, but it was still cool. I learned that in ranger school, you fucking prick. I fucking went invisible with my flies.
Karak 02:46:06 He did get that critical pretty early. That was kind of cool.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:46:15 I can't. Fair enough. Fair enough. It was pretty sick, dude. Maybe it just takes getting a big kick in the ass to really awaken oneself to understand that you are just a dude to me and you're really cool and I toss you my flask.
Dungeon Master 02:46:29 Just a bunch of frat boys. Oh, no.
Barrow Berkshire 02:46:45 I feel so bad that I taught shit to tournaments. It hurts. My belt is fucking real. Oh my god. Fuck, we're nice this time. Deal? And I hold out the last dribble in the rosé bottle.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:46:53 I berated you a lot. I deserved it. But I was mean a lot more, so we can just be neutral now. I hand out a half-empty fireball flask.
Gooch III 02:46:58 I mean, it's this time.
Barrow Berkshire 02:47:23 Bill drink it. Oh, my God. So sweet.
Dungeon Master 02:47:25 You guys have a second to catch your breath.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:47:26 I trade. I guzzle that drop. I have an instant migraine. And I'm still cold. The fireball turns into dual torpor.
Gooch III 02:47:34 Thank you. Thank you.
Barrow Berkshire 02:47:51 I go and hug the one foot of alabasters that I can reach and say, thanks for picking me up, dude. That was really scary, man. I didn't like that. I'd like this to be more emotional for you. Okay.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:48:00 Yeah, of course. You got it. We had a mission to do, and you weren't awake for it, so you needed some help. Well, I don't know. I think we better focus on the task at hand. Spit some more blood out.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:48:09 You cough up so much blood. You're so hurt. Dude, we're all boys and you guys almost died. You should be at least a little more happy about that first and then we can go
Dungeon Master 02:48:12 Yeah.
Barrow Berkshire 02:48:22 It's because you're right to me, right? You sound just like my dad. This is 4624 or whatever year it is. You can share your emotions now. You don't have to keep it all in anymore.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:48:40 Oh, indeed. Oh, thank you for the stiff drink. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I've been beat up a little bit. I'm happy to take a drink or two. Like, give me any heels.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:48:46 I empty a flask into one of your three trunks. I'm just getting everyone drunk. No. Take the edge off, dude. Smile a little bit. It'll do good for you.
Gooch III 02:48:46 That's nice.
Dungeon Master 02:48:52 Does he consent to this?
Barrow Berkshire 02:49:08 The characters are just always liquid based. Just a second. Please take my fluid.
Gooch III 02:49:19 I'm going to find Junior. The fourth. I'm going to dust him off a little bit. Make sure he's doing okay. Give him a little pat. These fucking kids. And then I go over to my...
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:49:20 Yeah, I guess I do feed a lot of liquid to people. Dude, what games do you have on that?
Dungeon Master 02:49:38 He's just playing his DSi. No. Fuck off, guys. I'm playing The Legend of Zelda The Phantom of Time. I forgot the time. Duh.
Barrow Berkshire 02:49:43 He's playing Sims pets. ocarina of time.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:49:43 This DSI. Yeah. He's blowing on the microphone.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:49:51 No, he had a Pokemon card. This guy's playing Pokemon Platinum. Oh, that's a nerd game, dude. He's my new bully victim.
Karak 02:50:01 And.
Gooch III 02:50:09 I'm going to go over to Gooch. I'm going to go over to Gooch Senior and just be like, well, are you proud of me, Deb?
Dungeon Master 02:50:12 He's playing that weird Mario game where he turns into pencil drawing to go in between walls and shit. You see...
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:50:20 Okay, you're back on. That's a lot cooler. Who are you? Does he have dementia? Oh, fuck.
Barrow Berkshire 02:50:20 Thank you.
Karak 02:50:37 for a while.
Dungeon Master 02:50:40 his heavy eyelids raised for just a second and he's got tears in his eyes as he puts his hand on his shoulder and he goes do you smell that it burns off my eyes as he just shits himself
Gooch III 02:50:43 Thank you.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:51:06 Dude, he's having a stroke. Dude.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:51:06 What the hell? He's stroking out. What?
Karak 02:51:09 you you
Dungeon Master 02:51:12 Oh, and he just sits right in front of you, choking on a cookie now. So your dad sits his pants in front of you. And then after that, he goes, I want you to meet my son. He's pretty special, I think. And then he turns around and he just stares at the wall.
Gooch III 02:51:16 Well. Just there was some.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:51:40 Oh.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:51:42 What is the singing aisle, dude? I can't say he didn't give you a reaction. I'm going to yarf. That's foul.
Gooch III 02:51:45 Some good and some bad, I guess. And I'll just... I'll light a little candle. A little pet. Aging is beautiful.
Dungeon Master 02:51:49 It still smells funny, guys. In fact, anybody in the room can kind of smell it. No way. Get rid of your knife. Just get rid of it.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:52:12 There's no way you think that after witnessing that. Let's draw some cards. Can we rest or what's the next thing?
Barrow Berkshire 02:52:12 It cracked me up. That's the company we are.
Gooch III 02:52:22 I've never had this much family time. What's up?
Dungeon Master 02:52:24 I think they both level up again, so they're like level six and seven. Yeah, you guys, you're not being incursion. The only thing in here is the remainder of the room, the throne area, the tree. Being from the Feywild, you're all very familiar with the ancient prophecy.
Barrow Berkshire 02:52:43 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:52:54 you know that there's some sort of ritual to bring this person back. So you know, you're supposed to bring it to the tree, but, um, up to you on, if you look around, if you do anything special, uh,
Gooch III 02:53:11 Guys, I have another wish. Do you think I should do something nice for these guys? They're supposed to be important. That seems weirdly specific.
Barrow Berkshire 02:53:22 You should give that angsty elf like a crazy buff. That'd be sick. You should give him a bigger dick. Probably. Like way too big. Like not enjoyable.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:53:24 That's epic, dude. Dude, this is my elf. I claimed him. I pop him out of my shell. Opa, third leg.
Karak 02:53:34 But.
Gooch III 02:53:39 This? That's way too big. I'm a look guy.
Dungeon Master 02:53:46 way too big
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:53:56 Gooch, dude, do you think this is your throne? Do you think the cards are that specific to size? Dude, you own a throne. Is this yours?
Alabaster Leatherback 02:54:07 It's okay.
Karak 02:54:12 yeah. Oh.
Gooch III 02:54:15 Oh, you mean like, I have a secret palace somewhere? One of the cards, is that what you're saying? Does this seem like mine? No. My estate is otherwheres.
Barrow Berkshire 02:54:24 What's your what's your address?
Dungeon Master 02:54:27 No, you get like the general sense. Yours is like off in the land somewhere. Land of the beast, you know.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:54:34 Worth a shot. Flare. All right, I want to waddle my egg dude over to the tree.
Dungeon Master 02:54:57 Walk over to the tree. What would you like to do there? Go ahead and give me some kind of check. How do you want to analyze it?
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:55:01 Does it seem like it just needs to rest at the tree, or is there something I need to do to it? Well, I want to check it out. I mean, we've had this mission that's ingrained in us at this point. We kind of seem to make it to the last thing.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:55:27 I think I need to do something with this tree. So I guess I'll just do inside. Not that that's even my best thing, but 12. I think you have to jam this egg against the tree somewhere. I'm just going to set it against the tree, I think. See if there's any reaction.
Dungeon Master 02:55:34 Yeah, I like an insight check. 12. Set it next to the tree.
Barrow Berkshire 02:55:48 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:56:05 You see the tree starts to open up behind it, like really slowly at first. And then it like snatches it and the tree gets up and starts to run with the egg out the door. Do you do anything? It yoinked your voice.
Karak 02:56:24 How big is the tree? Is it like 20 feet, 30 feet?
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:56:27 duty yoink to my boy uh i that was crazy i think you gotta let it happen
Barrow Berkshire 02:56:34 Thank you.
Gooch III 02:56:38 I throw a dagger at the tree's leg.
Dungeon Master 02:56:41 Dornimus gets to act first in this this tree it's like 20 feet tall seems to have been like a faux tree and it is stealing this egg and running away with it your 12 didn't decipher the trap
Karak 02:56:54 Yeah, unacceptable.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:56:57 Give me my boy back. Give me my boy back. Can I attack it? Can I chase it? 19. 14.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:56:57 That's great.
Barrow Berkshire 02:57:04 You attacked a magical tree. So that egg didn't go where it's supposed to go? Or that's the tree it's supposed to go to?
Gooch III 02:57:08 This tree just chilled that whole fight. This tree up. Big tree.
Dungeon Master 02:57:11 Go ahead, yeah. You can attack it before it leaves your space. 19 hits. Are you not? You're not sure.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:57:32 This is a fake tree, dude. It looks so promising. It's fake. I have 14 damage.
Dungeon Master 02:57:41 14 damage to the Awakened Tree. After you take your turn, everybody roll initiative real quick. No, this is right in it.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:57:53 Did we get a rest or we're just okay. Back at it. Damn. Yeah. Catch him.
Barrow Berkshire 02:57:56 No, no way. I think it's fine. This tree is going to be done quick.
Karak 02:57:56 We're just taking a breather. Just going to get a couple hits of 14.
Gooch III 02:58:11 To the bottom of initiative.
Dungeon Master 02:58:15 It's not going to go well for it. Okay, Tortimus, you're up first again. Go ahead and roll your actual attack. It hasn't had a chance to actually run out of your space yet, so it's like horizontal with you.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:58:32 Dude, I said give me my fucking boy. I'm just going to take both my attacks right now. Okay. I don't... Where am I? Okay, there we go. Okay. 1, 13. Bonus action flurry blows this fucker to...
Dungeon Master 02:58:44 10 misses, 20 hits. 13 damage. It doesn't say it's immune.
Gooch III 02:59:02 You stun a tree.
Barrow Berkshire 02:59:02 Thank you.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:59:02 That's three more attacks. 21, 26, 9 probably isn't it? 15 mole.
Dungeon Master 02:59:16 9 doesn't hit, but 21 and 26 hit. 6 and 9. 15 damage. This is a hardy-looking tree. It's not that strong-looking.
Tortimus Staggerfin 02:59:37 okay uh yeah dude this tree took the boy get it dunked him right out of my hands i did not just let him go
Gooch III 02:59:38 to the BBE tree.
Alabaster Leatherback 02:59:42 Yes.
Dungeon Master 02:59:46 BB3 is great. Barrow, your turn. Oh, you've been Cyrus too. That's the boy.
Barrow Berkshire 02:59:49 three three three three um i'm gonna fucking i'm gonna hook i'm gonna hook my uh oh fuck
Karak 03:00:01 My boy, my boy.
Barrow Berkshire 03:00:14 I choked my axe over turning in it. It's a disadvantage because it's far away, but I'll try my best. No way. Yeah, I'm around it now, I suppose. I'll try to hit it with my other thing.
Tortimus Staggerfin 03:00:16 you you
Dungeon Master 03:00:28 11 method. Yes. You have enough movement to get there. Damn.
Barrow Berkshire 03:00:44 Yeah, it's right in 60. Fuck me. I miss with my other attack. Not one style. Let me see if I'm still invisible. Is it one attack?
Barrow Berkshire 03:00:58 Yeah, it's until I attack. So I've become... Halfway through the year, I become visible again. And then I fucking each get swiped just, like, desperately as I'm falling, and I miss that too, obviously. But then I bonus action and say, fuck, and my fucking flies. My fucking flies. There's my bonus action. My fucking flies.
Tortimus Staggerfin 03:01:07 you were the he was the most startled for becoming visible again
Dungeon Master 03:01:16 You go invisible again? No way. You go invisible, hit the ground ancient, and then disappeared as you rolled.
Karak 03:01:30 Just poofs out right again.
Barrow Berkshire 03:01:31 Then I'm going to use my movement, which I have not used yet, to climb the tree and try to hide in its branches. I'm fucking embarrassed. That was fucking horrible, dude. Okay. Come on.
Dungeon Master 03:01:42 Give me a stealth check. Would be advantage, but I'm going to say climbing on him. He can feel you, so it's disadvantage, so it's a straight roll. I only got a 16 on that perception check. Doesn't know you're there.
Tortimus Staggerfin 03:01:47 Right. Nice.
Barrow Berkshire 03:02:04 19. I fucking beef it too, like I beef it hard. Embarrassing. Yeah, right.
Dungeon Master 03:02:11 Carrick, it's your turn. Pharaoh falls on the ground, turns invisible, and you don't realize that he's in the tree, but he is there. You scrape up your hand, your forearm, and your shin.
Karak 03:02:15 um i'm going to go ahead and take two attacks with advantage oh you're gonna miss 15.
Barrow Berkshire 03:02:37 It stays, dude. I'm in his branches. He can't run away. He can, but I'll stay with him.
Tortimus Staggerfin 03:02:41 Use your grenade orb. There's no one near him. There's definitely no one in that tree. Use your nade. Counts as a death because he ran away with you.
Dungeon Master 03:02:44 15 misses. Guys, this train is going to run away from you guys. Oh, that's true. 18 hits. Taking forever.
Karak 03:02:56 Oh, does an 18 hit? Okay, that's all right. The next one was good. It is there, though. Nine. That was unfortunate.
Dungeon Master 03:03:16 Douche the third. Okay. Yes, sir.
Karak 03:03:26 And I'm going to use my little bonus action to do one of those little healing little actions.
Gooch III 03:03:34 Alright. I'm going to move up to here. Attack with advantage. There's an ally within 5 feet of it. About time something like that happened. 17? Alright. Yeah. 7. I'm going to re-roll that.
Dungeon Master 03:03:47 17 hit. You mean not pretty. Yeah.
Gooch III 03:04:04 Because I think I'm supposed to do it on the weapon damage like you were saying. 8. And then sneak attack damage. That's good. 31. Oh, shit. So, 31. 39. Oh my god, I exploded again.
Dungeon Master 03:04:17 Yep. Oh, again. Come on. Hefty hair.
Karak 03:04:18 One of them, one of them exploded. Another one. Do again. It's rad. That's funny. The duality there every time.
Gooch III 03:04:32 45 plus 46. And then I have another attack. 26 to hit again. That's another 7.
Barrow Berkshire 03:04:32 Come on. Go again.
Tortimus Staggerfin 03:04:33 Use so much damage. Baseless tree.
Dungeon Master 03:04:45 This tree is losing a lot of bark on its base. 26 hit. Right. Heavy hit. Just stabbing an alabaster. You're up next. What's this thing's movement?
Gooch III 03:05:01 As I find its lowest root, I just
Alabaster Leatherback 03:05:14 Oh, I'm feeling so good. And I'm just going to kind of lumber on over. I don't have the movement to get there. But I guess I have my spiritual weapon. And let's see, I might have a spell that I can use.
Barrow Berkshire 03:05:22 And you're fucked up.
Dungeon Master 03:05:33 Yeah.
Alabaster Leatherback 03:05:44 Yeah, for, uh, let's see. Um, I'll do a whole person spell second level. Oh yeah. Uh,
Karak 03:05:48 And.
Dungeon Master 03:06:04 Can you read the spell? Because I think that only affects humanoid. This is a plant, technically. Okay. Is that a save? That is a 15.
Barrow Berkshire 03:06:08 Bye.
Alabaster Leatherback 03:06:15 Well, then I'll command this. I'll use command. Yeah, that's a wisdom saving throw. Meets it, beats it.
Dungeon Master 03:06:39 Dang, okay. Hits it. What do you say to try to stop it? Perfect. Okay, that's the turn. Yeah, absolutely. I think it's got 30 feet of movement to get over.
Alabaster Leatherback 03:06:44 I was going to yell a halt and then I'll use my bonus action for the spiritual weapon candidate attack. Cause it was already there. Sorry. Floating around. Oh no. Uh, 60 feet, 60 feet range. Or is that casting range?
Karak 03:06:50 The.
Dungeon Master 03:07:13 Regardless, they can get there. I think that's casting. I think you can move it 30 feet on your turn. 11 misses, though. Okay. This is just to see if you guys can all hit. Pharaoh does not get an attack of opportunity because he is with it the whole time. But it uses 60 feet of movement. It passes everybody else. It is dashing for the door. Everybody can take an attack.
Alabaster Leatherback 03:07:15 Okay, cool. That doesn't matter. Didn't hit.
Barrow Berkshire 03:07:33 Yeah.
Tortimus Staggerfin 03:07:41 21 to hit. Not a lot.
Dungeon Master 03:07:42 Except one. And those of you that were set up for advantage beforehand still have it when you have the attack. 21 hits. 19 hits. Come on, guys. You can do it. Dang.
Gooch III 03:07:57 And then I wouldn't get sneak attack, because it's still the same round. I guess I can reroll this, though. Oh. OK. Well, then I'll do that.
Alabaster Leatherback 03:07:58 19. Two ones. Yikes. Such low rolls today.
Karak 03:08:15 17, did I hit? Oh, again.
Dungeon Master 03:08:16 Yeah. It's the same run, but it's a new turn. You get sneak attack again. Okay. So we have 26, 37, 8 is 45, plus 4 is 49 damage.
Gooch III 03:08:32 And I got a 6, so 7, 26. All right.
Tortimus Staggerfin 03:08:38 you
Dungeon Master 03:08:50 It had 48 hit points left. So it gets combined to there before the tree slumps and explodes and splints and splinters to the ground, inside revealing the amber egg it tried to steal. The room, once again, quiet. This tree is no longer up in the corner. So there is the throne.
Dungeon Master 03:09:18 The artwork, the skulls on the pikes, the torches, and some stained glass stuff, but not a whole else out. A whole else there. What do you guys want to check out? You guys hear it, but you don't see anything. In theory, yeah.
Barrow Berkshire 03:09:29 I eat shit again hard falling out of the tree. Fuck! Fucking god damn it.
Gooch III 03:09:39 These eggs are supposed to be like the new leaders of the Feywild, right? So we should probably just throw it on the throne. Which one of them has...
Karak 03:09:44 Yeah. Because you're like,
Alabaster Leatherback 03:09:49 There you go. I like that idea.
Dungeon Master 03:09:56 You know the prophecy says, yada yada, at the source of death's life, they who would be crowned lord must give to the nourished realm, must rest the dream of stars, long diminish, and must give up their identity to be reborn in life's death with the breath of life and the twilight weave. You know you gotta put them in the tree. That's the whole shtick. Not that you've seen.
Karak 03:10:17 We're not at the tree yet, the real tree yet. Is that what we're saying? Okay. Is there any evidence?
Gooch III 03:10:28 I look around for the tree. 13. Really good. I think.
Barrow Berkshire 03:10:28 Barrow did good, yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:10:32 Yeah, go ahead and give me an investigation or perception. Everybody who wants to look can. Don't you have reliable talent or something?
Alabaster Leatherback 03:10:41 Yeah, I'll do one. Oh, but I have advantage. God damn. I don't think I can roll above a 10 tonight.
Karak 03:10:48 14 50 average they're hurting
Gooch III 03:10:58 It's only for things I have proficiency with, I think.
Barrow Berkshire 03:10:59 Okay.
Dungeon Master 03:11:02 a barrow invisibly sort of licking your wounds you make your way to the crown of the throne at one point sort of by yourself dusting off nobody can see you yet um and like after brushing off like your stomach you look up and a like
Dungeon Master 03:11:22 kind of crude but really uh like artistically beautiful oil painting of a tree sits hanging on the wall and that's the only thing you notice of importance you guys hear emanate from nowhere
Barrow Berkshire 03:11:35 There's a tree in the painting. As I speak, my flies slowly slow down, knowing that the fight has ended. Then you can see me again. I'm like the fucking guy in Charlie Brown and the kid in Peanuts where you can't see him.
Tortimus Staggerfin 03:11:49 Dude? Barrow? Dude?
Karak 03:11:54 On a dirty film.
Dungeon Master 03:11:58 Is it actually that you disappear or is it that you are just consistently hiding in the swarm of flies and you just can't really be disturbed? Like, do they know your general area? It's just like you guys see a swarming pile in the corner and you know it's Pharaoh. Okay. Okay.
Alabaster Leatherback 03:12:05 Thank you.
Barrow Berkshire 03:12:09 I mean, technically... Like, technically speaking, I'm invisible, but it's cool for the fight for it to, like, my things swarm around me and then they dissipate and I'm no longer there. Like, it's a magic trick. That's how I see it. Yeah.
Gooch III 03:12:16 Yeah, I like to imagine it's like the beekeeper, where it's just your full silhouette covered in flies, but you're just like, you can't see me. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:12:27 I like that too. That's very ninja-y. But you're technically invisible. Yes.
Barrow Berkshire 03:12:39 That's funny, but I'm going to keep the mechanic. I think that's funnier for sure. Yeah.
Gooch III 03:12:47 That's fair. So, can we look at this painting? Can I poke it? Oh. Oh, fuck. Bearer, I think you might be onto something. Oh, whoa. Don't throw my child in there.
Tortimus Staggerfin 03:12:48 Blah.
Dungeon Master 03:13:00 Yeah. You poke it and your finger doesn't hit any resistance. Keeps going.
Barrow Berkshire 03:13:10 Let's throw Gooch the Force in there just to see what happens. Yeah, which one's more expendable? Gooch, you have to answer. I mean, he looks close to death. He's like fucking in rigor mortis already. He died in the middle of the fight without getting hit.
Gooch III 03:13:17 Or my dad. Well, my dad was already dead, so... Yeah. Get rid of the smell. I'll just...
Alabaster Leatherback 03:13:17 We could throw the second instead and see what happens. Well, the dad shit his pants. I don't know.
Karak 03:13:23 you know,
Dungeon Master 03:13:39 He's fully erect. He's freaking mortised. Yeah, you toss him through and you see, like, in the painting, he hits the ground and lands and rolls in grass.
Tortimus Staggerfin 03:13:45 Jesus.
Barrow Berkshire 03:13:45 that Goblin's fucking hung dude
Gooch III 03:13:53 I'm tossing through. You okay, Dad? Oh, fuck. I'll jump through.
Dungeon Master 03:14:08 You guys see Gooch III turn into a small oil painting, sort of off in the distant version of himself as he runs into the painting. Yeah.
Barrow Berkshire 03:14:19 What the fuck? Can we get in? That sounds pretty cool. I let my flaws carry me.
Karak 03:14:20 I'm like, I don't understand what just happened, man. Like, what? The elephant just rams himself into the wall. Yeah, they all jump into frame.
Gooch III 03:14:25 It's a painting that's this big.
Alabaster Leatherback 03:14:32 We have a mission to do. Let's go. Yeah.
Tortimus Staggerfin 03:14:35 I put the, I put the egg back on the tree.
Dungeon Master 03:14:40 trees just like a shadow that's coming around you all get in when you get in your perspective doesn't shift you don't suddenly see everything in oil painting colors you're in a very vibrant and beautiful like scene and this is not really like any Feywild you've got to experience in your lifetime
Barrow Berkshire 03:14:48 My thighs carry me through. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:15:05 this is what you feel like it would have been in its prime. And in front of you is a very large ash tree sitting sort of on top of this hill. And as you walk up, you see that sort of carved naturally by the wood into this shape of like a cradle sitting nested at the root system at the base. And the sort of amber beans on your back glow ever so slightly as you walk up.
Alabaster Leatherback 03:15:40 I'll walk up, take the three I think I've got. Yeah, I'll take the ones I have up and walk towards the tree with them.
Dungeon Master 03:15:42 I believe it. Barrow has Kaladin. Gooch had nobody. Portimus had Cyrus. Alabaster has Cletus and Zariel. And Carrick has Leopold.
Karak 03:15:46 I'll do the same. Put mine down.
Tortimus Staggerfin 03:16:08 I'm going last. Last time I tried, it did not go well for me.
Barrow Berkshire 03:16:08 We make our way towards it.
Dungeon Master 03:16:19 Leopold, sorry, Alabaster's up first. You put one of them down. It only really seems to fit one at a time. And it sort of gets enveloped much more slowly and graceful and then disappears. And you see the cradle kind of like a wooden flower opens up. Nothing there.
Alabaster Leatherback 03:16:23 Yep. All right. Keep them coming, boys. And I'll just keep doing the next two or whatever. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:16:49 You do the next one, the next one, the next one, the next one.
Dungeon Master 03:16:55 And after you do all of them, you see the root system seems to glow underneath with like a golden color, sort of just like light escaping from the crack between the root and the ground. And you see this light sort of rise from the ground through the tree roots, up through the trunk and out the canopy. And it's like explodes into the sky as like this beam shoots from where you are into some distant space.
Dungeon Master 03:17:22 uh, like a reverse of what you guys saw when you were around the other tree. And we will leave it as you guys are in this oil painting. You just sort of sent off the, the future Lord of the Fae. Um, and you have completed your mission. You sit there, uh, some of you very battered and beaten. Some of you perfectly fine. Um,
Barrow Berkshire 03:17:44 I'd like to say one thing. That tree just came super fucking hard, dude. That's all.
Dungeon Master 03:17:52 Just sort of, yes. Okay.
Tortimus Staggerfin 03:17:59 Okay.
Alabaster Leatherback 03:18:02 Oh, indeed. Really set one up. And I'll turn to Gooch and I'll be like, so Gooch, what'd you wish for? Huh.
Gooch III 03:18:10 oh uh I guess I just wish they had like a shit ton of money you know that's always helpful yeah there's a recession in the farewell that's why they got us working
Barrow Berkshire 03:18:24 Thank you.
Tortimus Staggerfin 03:18:31 It's trying times. Everyone can use a little more pocket change here and there. As I scoop the tree come and put it in the shape of a pillow and I fall asleep.
Gooch III 03:18:46 That's a circle of life.
Dungeon Master 03:18:47 Okay. According to D&D standard rules, a gold piece weighs 9.1 grams or about 0.02 pounds. A weight of ton is 2,000 pounds. So the total weighting grams of that equals...
Barrow Berkshire 03:19:00 at the worst.
Dungeon Master 03:19:12 99,717 gold pieces to create one ton of gold. Shit or otherwise it still weighs a ton.
Alabaster Leatherback 03:19:24 Are we going to need money later after that? I don't know.
Gooch III 03:19:26 99k is pretty good. Well, it's not for me. I think I wished it.
Karak 03:19:29 Well, I guess you can't pass money on. You just have it in this guy's pocket. Big win. Well, we usually exclude gold from poundage. Or at all. I don't know if we've ever washed.
Barrow Berkshire 03:19:41 Also can't carry that much weight. That's fucking cool.
Tortimus Staggerfin 03:19:52 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 03:19:53 If you are getting a ton of something, that's going to break the passive rule.
Alabaster Leatherback 03:20:00 We could leave it stashed somewhere, I suppose. I can make one. There's nowhere to stand in the workshop. It's just full of gold.
Gooch III 03:20:04 Well, I think we have a bag of holding, don't we? I think we've got a... Oh, we've got the workshop. We can just dump it all in the workshop. It's a Scrooge McDuck basement where we just
Karak 03:20:10 Swim in it.
Barrow Berkshire 03:20:27 Okay.
Gooch III 03:20:35 We're going to find out the real BBEG of the campaign is just the IRS. Sick.
Alabaster Leatherback 03:20:40 you guys didn't pay your taxes
Dungeon Master 03:20:41 uh i asked i asked chad gpt this actually so i i asked just the internet how much the money would be how much coins would make up a ton um if it was solid i'll define the shape and everything later that much gold because again the workshop needs to be able to fit the gold in a piece um
Tortimus Staggerfin 03:20:43 We get hard .
Dungeon Master 03:21:06 A pile of 99,000 gold coins would be just larger than the size of a large chest. It'd be like about four foot by three feet by one and a half feet. But it would weigh 2,000 pounds. Gold is heavy. It makes sense. A gold bar is really hard to pick up.
Karak 03:21:15 Oh, we're great. We're great. We have plenty. We have plenty of space down there. Yeah. Speak for yourself.
Gooch III 03:21:17 Oh, that's nothing. You have to grab it all at once. For some. Sweet.
Barrow Berkshire 03:21:24 That's more dense than I expected. Yeah, for Gooch, the third it's simple.
Alabaster Leatherback 03:21:27 Gold is heavy. Yeah. All right. Well, we got a shit ton of gold.
Dungeon Master 03:21:44 We won't get into what you guys look like yet, but as the odiers awake in a very lovely oasis, sounds of birds running water like a spring,
Gooch III 03:21:45 For Goof's assert, he's secretly ripped.
Dungeon Master 03:22:07 uh before you even get a chance to see yourselves or your friends around you as you open your eyes you're by yourself in this space with the exception of in the center of the whole party is a about the size if not slightly larger than a giant a large chest is a pile of shit completely solid gold
Alabaster Leatherback 03:22:32 That's one piece. Oh dear.
Dungeon Master 03:22:34 But just sort of like curved and like pinched off at the top. Kind of rounded. Just sitting there and the weight of it sort of sinking into the ground. One large piece. One shit ton of gold. And we'll pick up with the rest in three weeks.
Gooch III 03:22:39 Wow.
Karak 03:22:50 Thank you.
Alabaster Leatherback 03:23:04 Oh, yeah. Well, we'll just need to get some aqua rega going. Maybe we can dissolve that. Make some... Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Dissolve it. Precipitate it out. Cast it into something convenient. The one shit tonic.
Dungeon Master 03:23:12 I mean, Leopold would know how to do that as an artificer. You can break down the elements. That'd be a nice side project. ...
Gooch III 03:23:29 I was going to ask if Cyrus was just a giant pig now.
Barrow Berkshire 03:23:31 goodbye Barrow my sweet sweet prince yeah I don't know
Alabaster Leatherback 03:23:34 That's great. Hmm. I wasn't thinking about it, but I can think, think a little more.
Karak 03:23:39 Might reassess my feet, but no.
Dungeon Master 03:23:44 Yeah. You don't have to say if don't want to, but is anybody going to change their character a little bit? Because your characters are being, you're being reborn as like the Fey Lord. So you don't, you can change things and it still make like canonical sense.
Barrow Berkshire 03:24:01 I'm tempted, but I don't know if I will or not.
Gooch III 03:24:16 Yeah, I don't know. I really liked being a little rogue. That was a lot of fun, to be more of a silly character. But I don't know. Think about it. I did roll really, really good. Yeah.
Tortimus Staggerfin 03:24:26 Yeah.
Alabaster Leatherback 03:24:29 Yeah, the thing is insane. Your character trashed things. I like monks.
Dungeon Master 03:24:36 Rogues are... You have to hit them with melee attacks. You need to be engaged during play. I'm getting dodged.
Barrow Berkshire 03:24:37 You didn't take your points the whole time.
Karak 03:24:41 In attack. Yep. It's good.
Gooch III 03:24:45 Higher level monsters, they don't generally tend to hit once they hit with AOEs. And so high level rogues do really well. Because even if I did get hit, I could do not evasion, but any dodge. Or even if I do get hit, I only take half. So I mean, I never even had to use that. Crazy.
Barrow Berkshire 03:25:15 That's crazy.
Dungeon Master 03:25:18 Yeah, I don't think you really got touched. It was also... Oh, you could have re-rolled, I guess. It was an AoE, though. You couldn't have made me...
Gooch III 03:25:21 I got hit one time with the spikes when he shot him, and I thought about using my luck to not, but I was like, eh. Yeah. No, no, no, no. Yeah, I just rolled really bad on the deck save because my deck save is huge. I still missed. This is that cat
Alabaster Leatherback 03:25:33 Might as well take a hit. Oh, no. Not a good fighter like the other one.
Gooch III 03:25:51 that we had to take all the teeth out. It's got no teeth. It's just all gums. It's all gummy. She's a sweetheart, though. She just sits on my lap. She's super mean to the dog, though.
Karak 03:25:56 Now.
Dungeon Master 03:25:56 Thank you.
Barrow Berkshire 03:26:04 What kind of barbarian did you choose? Were you playing it?
Alabaster Leatherback 03:26:12 You kind of have to be with no teeth.
Tortimus Staggerfin 03:26:15 What else are you going to do?
Gooch III 03:26:20 She's always smacking him around. Wild magic barbarians are awesome. We level up.
Karak 03:26:33 uh wild surge yeah of course we did through that thing
Barrow Berkshire 03:26:38 It did so much.
Dungeon Master 03:26:54 You guys leveled up with your other characters right before you went in. You don't get to level up again. There's five of you.
Gooch III 03:26:59 What? I don't believe it. I should have. I should have wished that they were all up 20. Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah.
Barrow Berkshire 03:27:08 We had an EXP share equipped.
Tortimus Staggerfin 03:27:13 Yeah. You'd have had to or forced to respect it.
Dungeon Master 03:27:23 I would have made you each level four. I like that you played it in character. That shit tentacle is funny. They have no conception of why that's there. That's just... You guys come to... If changes occur, you're changed slightly. You're confused.
Gooch III 03:27:29 I guess my intelligence was too low to ask for a good wish. That's why I tried to keep it simple.
Karak 03:27:34 Thank you.
Alabaster Leatherback 03:27:40 Yeah, that was good.
Dungeon Master 03:27:49 You're not in the same place you left, and there's just a giant pile of gold shaped like a turd just right in front of you. All righty, fellers.
Gooch III 03:28:02 Oh, shit. Well, that was fun. It was a fun little mini arc.
Tortimus Staggerfin 03:28:03 That was fun. These characters are real fun.
Karak 03:28:13 yeah.
Alabaster Leatherback 03:28:17 That was awesome. Hey, yeah. So are we going to have some like perk going on there? Having gone through that ritual? Is there like some innate ability? Okay. Interesting.
Barrow Berkshire 03:28:17 Yeah, I had a blast. For a while, yeah. Not forever.
Dungeon Master 03:28:19 Your old characters are now fae. Imagine just being silly to serious shit. That'd be funny. Am I going to have some what? Yeah, I'll figure something.
Gooch III 03:28:44 Yeah, bed, bath and beyond discounts. You famous. F a assaulted.
Dungeon Master 03:28:44 I was thinking like, you know, it would have been easy to do just like fey touched, but I think since some of you are already fey touched, it's like a wasted thing to give you. So I'll give everybody something that nobody just has yet. A little boon. What? A fey. Just a new fey. Fey assault is the worst.
Alabaster Leatherback 03:28:47 Yeah. Cool. Just pick a feet. Face. Touch. Oh, God.
Karak 03:28:50 Awesome.
Alabaster Leatherback 03:29:17 All right, well, I got to get off the bed, but good games. See you all later.
Karak 03:29:21 Yeah. GGs. Later guys.
Gooch III 03:29:22 Yeah, same here. Thank you, Jonathan. All right.
Dungeon Master 03:29:24 See you guys.
Barrow Berkshire 03:29:26 He's. This time we.
Tortimus Staggerfin 03:29:29 Yeah.

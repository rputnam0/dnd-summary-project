Dungeon Master 00:00:00 This is the first thing we wanted to record.
Zariel Torgan 00:00:03 That AI guy sounds like the coolest dude I know. He definitely is. He's definitely fucking.
Kaladin Shash 00:00:03 That's funny. Hey Craig.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:04 All right. Yeah. So that, that will pick us all up. And then, uh, you guys can download the file too, just by clicking that, that link in the chat if you want. He pulls tail big time. Got it.
Zariel Torgan 00:00:28 Oh yeah. Sorry. Apologies. How's everybody doing?
Dungeon Master 00:00:30 This is it. Why not? Yeah, we should cover that first, honestly.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:34 Yeah, that's great. Doing good. Sticking around. Oh yeah, I guess, well, we could sort it out after the session too, but we should try and figure out the plan for this weekend. OK.
Kaladin Shash 00:00:53 Yeah, rough timelines would be great. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:00:57 Yeah, let's just do it now. I'm cool with whatever. I assumed we weren't gonna really be doing anything Friday, just because everybody's gotta get here. So I figured Friday, we get in, go to bed, hang out, wake up Saturday, and then from there, I'm cool with whatever. It's not gonna take all of Saturday to play the session.
Dungeon Master 00:01:09 Right.
Zariel Torgan 00:01:21 So if you guys wanted to get up whenever you feel like it, have breakfast whenever you feel like it, and then meet up for lunch or something, like an early lunch, and then we could either hang out or do something as a big group with all of our... Sure. And then, yeah, do something fun together.
Dungeon Master 00:01:40 Like blank or something. Something.
Zariel Torgan 00:01:52 that's not D&D and then do D&D in the afternoon, you know, towards evening. Or we could play D&D when it's hot so we can stay in the cabin and then later at night we could go out and do something fun or go have dinner somewhere. I don't know, that's kind of what I was imagining. But I'm cool with whatever you guys want to do.
Leopold Magnus 00:02:14 Yeah, that sounds great to me. Sounds like a lot of fun. Definitely figured to get down by the lake would be would be fun, especially if it's warm. But if you guys want to. Yeah, yeah, I can have Megan bring hers.
Kaladin Shash 00:02:14 Yeah. I'm just along for the ride as far as Saturday's organization. Yeah. Yes. I was planning on bringing one of my sub board.
Dungeon Master 00:02:16 Ram.
Zariel Torgan 00:02:35 Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, the weather is actually not supposed to be terrible. I think it's only going to be, like, high 80s up here. So... Yeah. So... Yeah, and so if we, you know, and that could always change, too, you know, it's... But if we want to plan on just spending the hot part of the day, you know, just chilling,
Leopold Magnus 00:02:44 Oh, yeah, that's catch, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:02:44 That'll be good, not hot, hot. Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:02:47 Yeah, warm but not hot.
Zariel Torgan 00:03:01 You know, we could all have lunch at the restaurant or something and then go out and play on the lake or do some fishing because there's some really good fishing going right now. Or anything like that.
Zariel Torgan 00:03:12 and then just at like four or three or five or something, depending on how late we want to play, we just buckle down. Right now, I've got three different cabins reserved for you guys. I didn't know if you were bringing Megan, Bren. I wasn't sure if... Okay, so I was figuring I'd put you in the biggest cabin, the six-person cabin, and then
Leopold Magnus 00:03:27 Thank you.
Kaladin Shash 00:03:32 No. That's totally fine. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:03:41 we would play in the cabin that you're going to be in. Okay, and so I figure that Jonathan and Rex, you both got two-person cabins because you're bringing somebody. That way your significant others have somewhere to stay if they don't feel like sitting there and watching us play D&D.
Dungeon Master 00:03:54 Mm-hmm. Yeah, and we'll just lose interest in that very quickly.
Kaladin Shash 00:03:59 No, no, no. Walk on out. Walk on out. Let's. Yep. Is that where we played last time with the big deck?
Leopold Magnus 00:03:59 Yeah, that's very thoughtful.
Zariel Torgan 00:04:04 Yeah, uh, yeah. Um, so anyway, um, I'll shoot you the details, uh, which cabins I've got set aside. I don't care which one of you gets which. I mean, they're all pretty much the same, uh, in that smaller category. And then Bren, I'm gonna put you in cabin 14. It's a six-person cabin, um, with, uh... No, no, actually, uh, no, we are 19.
Dungeon Master 00:04:29 Now we are in one. Awesome shit.
Kaladin Shash 00:04:33 OK. OK, sweet. Some weeping. OK. It's good. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:04:34 But this one is also a good size, and it's pretty close to the Starlink setup that I've got, so we probably would be able to get on there for a decent amount of stuff. But anyway, it's got a decent-sized table, and then I figure that way, you know,
Leopold Magnus 00:04:49 Cool.
Zariel Torgan 00:04:58 people that want to not necessarily sit there with us and, you know, have a place to be. So anyway, that's the loose idea. I've got all three of them booked for Friday and Saturday night. If anybody wants to stay into Sunday, that works fine too. Yeah, that makes sense. Absolutely.
Kaladin Shash 00:05:15 No, I'll have to head back. I'll have to head back. Jesse, I wanted to just ask, is it OK if I bring CODA? OK, sweet. Yeah, I don't get off.
Leopold Magnus 00:05:17 Yeah, I've got got to work. Cool. Sweet. Yeah, no, I guess like I think Megan I could probably get there like evening Friday if you guys I don't know what what time of day you guys would be able to make it, but we can play some games today.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:27 Yeah, any animals that want to come is fine. They're all pet friendly.
Kaladin Shash 00:05:44 I don't get off until like 520 and then I'd probably just come over here, throw stuff in the car and then drive down. So I don't know how long the drive is. Yeah, so I probably wouldn't be getting up. You guys are meant to get three hours drive.
Leopold Magnus 00:05:51 Okay. Okay, so you guys are going to be there around nine then? Okay, I'll probably aim for about that then. Around there. I mean, they'll probably like that a little better anyhow and have some time to get ready.
Dungeon Master 00:05:52 Mm hmm. I don't get off until at least five also, so I would be getting there like nine. Right. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:06:15 But yeah, we could. We could definitely play some more casual board games or something Friday evening or. Yeah, bring clank, bring clank again, do those fun. OK, yeah, oh yeah, yeah, we'll have like 677. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:06:19 Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I can bring a few different games. Oh yeah, that's a great one. And then I have some games that are for larger groups too, which are good. Cool, right on.
Zariel Torgan 00:06:33 Yeah, I was going to say, because I know Becca's going to be up here this weekend with me. So what's that? 2, 4, 6, 7? So yeah, that'd be cool. So then let's say we want a soft commit, and we can always change it later. Soft commit, late Friday night, if we feel up to it.
Zariel Torgan 00:06:57 We could get together and do some stuff. Otherwise, it'll be for relaxing. And then Saturday morning is however you guys want to spend it. Saturday afternoon, we'll get together for lunch at like 11 or something. And then we can all go out on the lake or we could do this or that or whatever. And then towards the afternoon, we'll sit down and that's when we'll start really hitting the D&D bricks. All right.
Kaladin Shash 00:07:02 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:07:22 Got it.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:26 Well, I'm good with that. That was all I had, so I'm cool. Yeah, I'm cool. Yes. All right, where is that? Oh, here it is. Gotta get on your Spotify link. All right, well, I will be quiet now, and I will just listen.
Dungeon Master 00:07:28 Mm-hmm. Are you cool? Nice. Are we thinking we're ready? Does anybody have anything else?
Kaladin Shash 00:07:38 No good.
Dungeon Master 00:08:03 Nice. OK, then. Recap of last session if you guys need it. Otherwise, we can just go right into it. How about no?
Zariel Torgan 00:08:18 I wouldn't mind a really ancillary recap, just like really not important stuff. Alright.
Kaladin Shash 00:08:23 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:08:36 Okay, so our last session picked up with the whole party standing in sort of the mouth of what became that fungal cave. You spent some time licking your wounds before setting off again down the tunnel that you felt was where the missing person was drug through, which you had discerned with some good investigation checks. You followed it with ease until you finally came to a three-way split where the drag marks went left, but the direct path that what you felt was the right direction went straight ahead.
Dungeon Master 00:09:07 He eventually followed the left tunnel, and after an unfortunate natural one, the party alerted yet another large fungal monster, the Myconid Sovereign, which was just around the corner. It was a hard-fought battle, but the party was able to destroy the monster with just a single near-death experience from a certain somebody. It was also down this tunnel that the party had discovered the missing person that they had just chased down here to rescue.
Kaladin Shash 00:09:10 Please.
Dungeon Master 00:09:34 At this point, they were beyond saving, having already died as a part of the process. The party had not been aware that the tight timeline you had been was deeply impacted by that first short rest. I feel like this is going to be a lesson that's going to prove key to your guys' future success as legionnaire soldiers, but you know, who knows? Maybe you don't learn. You continued onward down the tunnels before eventually converging into a singular large fungal arena.
Dungeon Master 00:10:02 light ambiently with a purplish hue sort of sifted through the air, the large death cap mushroom slowly released toxic spores at the perimeter, and in the center, a hulking engorged fungal soldier, the mutated form of the fire previously known as legionnaire lancex.
Dungeon Master 00:10:22 A deadly fight ensued seeing many close to death experiences with Zarya and Leopold both finding themselves having to push forward and deeper and give in to the reserves of their blood curse. You closed and vanquished your foe and then set forth to discover an unconscious mysterious but fair woman.
Dungeon Master 00:10:45 fairly normal in appearance. She had flowers growing out of her hair, certain parts of her hands, and very densely inside of a mask that was on her face. It's difficult to assess if the plants are also in her mouth or not. It's like very filled, and there's like a lot of mist sort of in there, and you are not sure if the mask is putting her in this state, or if the mask is the only reason that she is breathing.
Kaladin Shash 00:10:59 Ciao.
Dungeon Master 00:11:15 Doing the sensible thing, you gathered her up, concealed her, and then set out to put her in a secluded and isolated tunnel just for you guys. Another unnatural one, sorry, another natural one, which is very unfortunate, you stumbled into a very obviously more powerful, unrecognizable soldier bearing the insignia of the Corps on its shoulder, the same as you.
Dungeon Master 00:11:42 Silently, it made quick work of its quarry and then watched you closely, making obvious note of the figure you were trying to conceal. You did your best to talk your way out of this, but not moments later, Ratchet, your commanding officer assigned to overseeing and monitoring your vital status, made verbal contact through your arcane speaking runes and said that you had been called in for an emergency meeting by the captain. You pushed forward and stashed the girl, and that is where we pick up now.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:52 you.
Kaladin Shash 00:12:03 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:12:12 You guys just made it to this very far end tunnel section that Zariel had known about. This girl's still unconscious. She doesn't show any signs of waking up. What would you like to do?
Kaladin Shash 00:12:36 We're trying. We're trying to get back like quickly guys. We're trying to follow. For this. Command that we got to return quickly. OK, that's fine. It takes me a while though. It takes me a while to cast identify. No. That's OK, we should.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:49 Yeah, I think if we diddle-dally for too long, it will draw some suspicion if they're not already queued in.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:53 Yeah, I would imagine. Oh, good. I thought we already identified. Yeah, didn't you figure out it was Faye? Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:13:06 Did we do it? Do we do identify on it and just realize there was some sort of arcane magic to it? No zip. OK. No.
Dungeon Master 00:13:12 The mask. You did identify it while you were in that sort of large arena and as part of that process, Kellen Oak like went a little bit extra to establish a connection with it.
Dungeon Master 00:13:29 And we'll touch on that as soon as it comes up with your character. But yes, you did do identify on it. It was inconclusive as with all magic of the Fae as sort of ever-changing and breaking rules. But you got an overwhelming sense that this is like Fae.
Kaladin Shash 00:13:40 Yep.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:50 Yeah, I think I would agree that we should probably get back. I mean, there's a good chance that our cover's already blown with this thing anyway. We should probably start thinking of what our cover's going to be when they're like, so why'd you leave that girl there? Because, I mean, that thing clearly saw us. So we should probably, I guess I should be doing this in character.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:05 Yeah, that's a good point, strategize a little bit. Well, that's a very good point, Keledon.
Kaladin Shash 00:14:12 They just they just saw they just saw a body though, right? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:14:16 You're not sure. The figure didn't speak, and they were like in a full suit of armor. You couldn't see face. You couldn't see any skin. It was just like a sleek black suit that sort of hid any expression from them. They just stared at you, made note of it, and then you got that sort of contact later. But it didn't stick around. It went and got its blade and then moved away.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:41 Jonathan, how far away from the cave are we? Have we left quite a ways?
Dungeon Master 00:14:47 Yeah, like if, if you think about it, the wall is huge, the walls between each sector, like, you know, 50 to 100 yards wide, just like space in between and like very long is a huge city. It's sort of along the Grove District, but it's like the distal end between the Grove and Don district. So it's very far away. It's nowhere near the cave that you were initially at.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:12 Got it. And right now we're in the Emerald Grove. Okay. Hey Zariel, I have a question for you and your adventures. Did you ever come across at an unfortunate place, a mortuary?
Dungeon Master 00:15:16 No, right now you're in the tunnel in the wall of the core of like one of the sections. Not in the wall.
Kaladin Shash 00:15:19 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:29 Shoot. Have I come across a mortuary? I don't know. Yeah, whale. Leo, I think that's more of a surface type thing.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:55 What we've got down here is mostly service tunnels and access ports, things of that nature.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:55 Hmm. Oh, indeed, you have spent your time underground. Hmm. Well, I was just thinking if we could find some unfortunate soul to sling over our shoulder, we might be able to come up with an excuse as to whom we had underneath the blanket.
Kaladin Shash 00:16:09 Very good. Why don't we just say it was some fungus? We do, we have the heads, do not?
Leopold Magnus 00:16:28 We have to have something to bring back, don't we?
Zariel Torgan 00:16:35 Well, gentlemen, I think that first we should assess what they know. You know, I mean, we're only keeping her secret as a precautionary measure. It might behoove us just to get there and see whether or not we even are questioned about it. I think if they ask us, we can then say, oh, you know,
Zariel Torgan 00:17:02 this or that or whatever and then ask if it matters, you know, private business and such. We are in a totally different area than where these attacks were. We could be on unrelated business.
Kaladin Shash 00:17:06 Yes. Very good. OK.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:09 All right then, why don't we make our way? I don't.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:27 Can I ask, out of character, or above the table, who has good charisma in this group? Well, I've got minus one.
Dungeon Master 00:17:30 I don't think any of you did it.
Kaladin Shash 00:17:35 My wisdom is my softest score, my very softest score. I'm just like you, just a neutral. We're the face of the party, here we go.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:39 Yeah, I have plus zero to charisma, so I don't think any of us have good charisma. Minus one, and Kaladin, what do you have? Okay, so both you and I should technically be the face. Oh my god, with a plus zero?
Zariel Torgan 00:18:00 Yeah, I'm gonna carry the bag and I'm gonna be quiet. But I'm cool with that. I mean, if we wanna just get in there and just see what's up, we don't wanna be like going in to see the cops and like, we didn't murder that girl. And they're like, we're here for parking tickets. So I say we just check it out. Let's do it.
Kaladin Shash 00:18:05 Yeah. What girl? Already.
Leopold Magnus 00:18:22 OK, yeah, that's that's fair. Yep, just roll with the punches.
Dungeon Master 00:18:32 I, okay. Before we go any further, Kaladin, give me, I mean, you guys are just talking about it. Give me just a straight charisma check. There has been something sort of boiling in the back of your head since making contact with that mask.
Kaladin Shash 00:18:35 Let us go. On fire. There's almost a 19. I was like right there.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:39 Uh, uh,
Dungeon Master 00:19:03 You seem like unable to break the connection to it. You just have like, almost feels like a strand of Fae magic tethered to you. Something happened when you were identifying it. And as far as you can tell, the mask feels bound to you.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:19 Hohohohoho, no.
Kaladin Shash 00:19:27 I think I would, um... I'd be a little bit reserved, but I'd probably... Gentlemen, we need to be careful with what we say. Let us keep this secret close to our chest. I think... I think the mask and the girl of some import. I cannot tell, but... There's something there.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:55 Well, I would agree.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:59 Well indeed, Kaladin. What do you sense behind this mask?
Kaladin Shash 00:20:07 I don't know. I had difficulty with the identification of the magic, which told me it is not of this place. I need to do more. I don't know anything else. I just know what I feel. I've not felt it.
Dungeon Master 00:20:25 Hmm.
Zariel Torgan 00:20:32 Well, we all wear masks, metaphorically speaking. You gotta stop doing that. It's gonna hurt you one of these days. Are we doing this while we're walking back?
Leopold Magnus 00:20:39 Well, indeed. In fact, I can't even take this thing off. And I reach up and I try to rattle my face mask off.
Kaladin Shash 00:20:43 Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
Dungeon Master 00:21:00 Yeah, so you guys are heading back to the core. Sweet. You guys make your way back. Easy enough, you just use the direct line within the wall, the one that leads you back to the center. And then as you get to HQ, the bunk area, do you guys report back in to Ratchet, which was your CO?
Zariel Torgan 00:21:02 OK, all right, sweet. Yeah, he's the one that called us, right?
Kaladin Shash 00:21:26 Yeah, he's who won first in the meeting, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:21:31 Yeah. As you guys approach, do you sort of just walk up silently? Do you start with a conversation as you walk in? Do you see a... Oh my God, I think I've had to do his Irish accent. As you pop up and he says, Oi, lads. Pleasure to see you again. Thanks for coming in so quickly.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:47 I'm just gonna not say anything. I'm just gonna slowly pull out one of the bigger Mike and Ed heads for my bag and just kind of give it a little shake.
Kaladin Shash 00:22:09 Say hello to that shit. You told us to investigate the missing person. We did this. All this, this mice in it, it's nothing. We took care of it. It was a whole colony.
Dungeon Master 00:22:14 Now, what the fuck is that? Right, but what is it? Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:22:36 We'll address your guys' rewards once you're done with the briefing. I'll add instructions on this one. Not entirely sure what's going on, but you've each been requested to talk. Zariel, if you'll follow me, there's this room down here I'm supposed to take you to.
Dungeon Master 00:22:56 Caledon, go ahead and head to the office at the end of the hall. And then Leopold, come with me. I've got another room for you after Zariel. And I've just been told that you're supposed to wait there. I do mind. I just told you where you're supposed to go.
Leopold Magnus 00:23:09 Well, I don't quite like, uh, splitting up. Zariel's quite a buddy of mine. Would you mind if I hang with him? Oh, dear. I do not like this rat shit fellow, but I say it too loud.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:10 All right, boys. Just right in front of him.
Kaladin Shash 00:23:26 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:23:31 You do realize I just said that I was supposed to be the one who was supposed to talk to you, right? And you're going to start it off by saying that you don't like me. Give me a persuasion check or a deception check.
Leopold Magnus 00:23:38 No, no, no, of course. And I just trail off.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:45 He's got like a British office sense of humor, you know, very dry. Oh, no, don't give me that. 10.
Dungeon Master 00:23:59 You can't make up for a charisma-based statement. Right. Well, anyway, you two follow me. Caledon, can you manage yourself?
Kaladin Shash 00:24:00 You got this. It happened. It happened. Right.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:19 Can I, would I have time to say something? Because, I mean, I wanted to make that joke, but would I have had time to say something before all this goes down? All right, I just want to say, boys, we did a good thing bringing that injured, vagrant lady home. You guys were good men. And then I'll take off.
Kaladin Shash 00:24:30 Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:24:30 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:50 just so we can get our story straight when they individually ask us about what happened.
Dungeon Master 00:24:58 Okay, you each go to like a separate room. Zario yours is like pretty standard just looks like side office. It's just like beside the bunk area. You're not sure it's like pretty basic room.
Dungeon Master 00:25:13 Leopold, you're taken to a similar room, although you don't know it. It's all happening simultaneously. And then Kaladin, as you make your way down the hall, you eventually hit a set of guarded doors. And in front of them, you recognize what you can identify as the more elite guards. They take on much higher responsibility, and they're very strong, formidable soldiers for the Corps.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:22 Bye!
Dungeon Master 00:25:41 There's one to each side of the door. Do you head in? Do you falter? What's sort of the plan from each of you? All right, you step in.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:51 I'll go right in.
Kaladin Shash 00:25:51 Let's have a walk around.
Dungeon Master 00:25:56 Zario sitting at his desk with his feet kicked up onto like the corner of like the nice wood and dirty like sort of cowboy shit kicker boots. You see Captain Levi's just waiting there for you. Hands like sort of gently folded up on his lap. His hat tipped down just a bit. Leopold, as you enter the room, nobody is there just yet. Ratchet goes, right, I'm supposed to go talk with somebody first just because I'm not entirely sure what I'm supposed to be asking you.
Dungeon Master 00:26:26 I'm going to brief, get briefed before I brief you, if that makes sense. And then Kaladin, as you step into the room, it opens up to like a huge space. And I even, I just put up a little scene on this one so you guys would have something to look at for this part. But sitting at the end of the office space, you have Lord Marshal Thuris sitting at his desk going through some paperwork.
Dungeon Master 00:26:56 silently you have some scribes in the corners just taking notes and he's got like his spectacles at the edge of his nose that he sort of adjusts and puts on a little bit closer before he makes eye contact with you and he goes oh yes um hold on he's his accent similar to yours uh come in sit please and then each of you
Dungeon Master 00:27:20 Go ahead and roll. We'll just do a loose initiative checks to see who gets sort of addressed first. Nice, nice, nice. Leopold, bring it up first. Then Kaladin and then Zarya. OK, Leopold, you're sitting in this room by yourself. Do you do anything while you wait?
Zariel Torgan 00:27:35 Thank you for watching.
Leopold Magnus 00:27:57 All right, there it goes. Yeah, so I'm in the room. Is there any little gizmos or gadgets? I'm looking for an object. Maybe it's small, like a candlestick or I don't know, what would be a common item in here?
Zariel Torgan 00:28:08 Hmph.
Dungeon Master 00:28:23 In the room that you were specifically in, it's pretty basic. There's just like, it's a pretty empty room. You've got like arcane sconces that have just like the light cantrip enchanted into lighting each side of the walls. And then there's just like two chairs and a desk set across from each other. So it's just like a briefing room. It's pretty standard. There's not like loose candlesticks because that's not necessary anymore. There's no like extra furniture in here.
Leopold Magnus 00:28:54 Okay, um Is there a chair in the uh in the room Okay, I am going to do some magical tinkering with the chair that rat shit is gonna sit in Um, and uh, i'm gonna i'm gonna record a a message of fake fart just kind of like a
Dungeon Master 00:29:05 Two chairs and a table. Okay. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:14 Oh god.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:24 you know, like really loud ripper and make it emit a fart odor. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:29:35 Give me, we'll do a dexterity check to see how fast you can do this so that like, there's no, not like how close of a chance it is to him walking in on you like underneath his chair, putting a quick tinkering thing on.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:53 Uh, let me. Oh, that was going to be a 19. God damn it. OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah. After I done, I would just sit back down.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:56 Going to invent a whoopee cushion real fast, that's all.
Dungeon Master 00:30:00 Keeps doing it to you. 11's pretty good. I was just going to do DC 10. He walks in on you. You get it done. Sit down at your desk. It takes a couple minutes, but finally, Ratchet walks in. He goes, right. Are you sitting at this point? Right. Obviously, you saw if you had to sit yourself. That's totally cool. So I just got
Dungeon Master 00:30:27 sort of briefed on what I'm supposed to know about this and it's a little interesting. What's up with the girl? He did. He sat in his chair in front of you. Yeah. It's just you.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:37 But he hasn't sat down at this point. He did. He sat in his chair. OK, and it ripped a big fart like it was audible.
Zariel Torgan 00:30:38 Only the important stuff is what he wants to know.
Kaladin Shash 00:30:52 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:30:55 It's just you and him in the room, and a fart sound and smell comes out of nowhere. He looks at you dumbfounded. He goes, you can fart. A suit of armor can pass gas.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:09 I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Leopold Magnus 00:31:12 Oh, dear, Magnus, that is some horrendous doo-doo. Ratshit, what have you been eating? Oh, didn't you just smell it?
Dungeon Master 00:31:22 Right, so you don't think that I'd know if I was the one who shit myself. Right, but I'm one person who's in this room. I know that I didn't shit my pants, and you're the only other figure in this room. Like, logically, you have to see how that adds up, that if it's not me, it has to be you.
Leopold Magnus 00:31:46 Well, if you're the smart one, Ratchet, I don't know what you're talking about. Anyways... Hm?
Dungeon Master 00:31:51 Is this a fucking game to you? I'm so fucking confused. Anyway, I was, uh, I'm just supposed to ask you what the deal is with the girl. It's a sort of, like I said, it's an odd situation.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:01 High fantasy.
Leopold Magnus 00:32:15 What girl? Oh, I had no idea what you were talking about. And that smell is just got, oh. Rat shit. That's what I was going for. All right. Uh, performance check.
Dungeon Master 00:32:23 give me a deception check and go ahead and you can roll give me the deception check with a d4 of just like bonus just because you've sort of threw him off in this situation.
Kaladin Shash 00:32:45 Perfect.
Leopold Magnus 00:32:47 All right, but with a D4. Not very good. What's that? Oh. Yeah, yeah, it was 11 plus 2, so 13.
Dungeon Master 00:32:52 Oh, sorry, no, if they're the same. Deception check, sorry if I said performance, but if they're the same number, you can just use the rule. 13 OK. So he just he sets back and he goes. Well, alright.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:11 Oh, sorry. I'll stop. I didn't think it would pick it up. All right. Don't worry, I'll be quiet. I was noodling because I wasn't on, so I'll stop now.
Dungeon Master 00:33:20 Just here, are you just shredding right now? Is that what's happening? It only takes up pieces of it, but it sounds good. Do you want to turn your characters on? You continue? If you just want to mute, you can fucking play away. That's great. Feel free to give my characters badass entrances or something like that.
Leopold Magnus 00:33:22 I think that's what's happening. Yeah, it's pretty sick. You're noodling. That's awesome.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:46 Yeah, sorry, I'll do that.
Dungeon Master 00:33:51 Ratchet sits back and he goes, well, right. I'm going to be honest, I couldn't tell if you're lying anyway, you're just a face of armor. I'm not entirely sure how it goes, but how was your guys's mission? Did it fucking go all right? That was your first big one. And he seems to be sort of shooting the shit at this point.
Leopold Magnus 00:34:09 Oh, dear. That was... Well, let me tell you, Ratshit, it was quite the doozy. First of all, we went down into this cave, and then Leopold just goes on and on and on and on. Like, you would be bored to death.
Dungeon Master 00:34:28 Well, and honestly you'd think that but you see that Ratchet's like really encapsulated in this you get the sense that ever since he was sort of promoted up to a maybe like a more.
Dungeon Master 00:34:38 officer type position where he's just sort of overseeing the other soldiers that he probably doesn't get out as much. So the fact that you're talking about like this underground fungal network that like spans underneath the Storm District and the Emerald Grove, it's just like he's in the story. So then we switch to Kaladin. You step into this huge office. And then what do you do as you're sort of ushered to sit?
Kaladin Shash 00:35:08 Who's in the office with me? Right. Good day. We're putting Walker towards the chair.
Dungeon Master 00:35:10 It's the Lord Marshal Thur, the large sort of bear-like man. He's just like covered in hair, thick arms. He's a very renowned soldier before he sort of took this like political office position where he's like the face of the legionnaire. He's pretty much like the highest ranking person you've ever met in the city.
Kaladin Shash 00:35:43 Are you to question me or am I waiting for Ratchet? Please let me know what you know. I don't know why we are here.
Dungeon Master 00:35:49 You were not waiting for the rat shit, no. That depends. I could tell you what I know or you could tell me what you know. Right. I won't waste your time then. The Legionnaire Corps was made alert that two of the soldiers statuses had gone deceased for a moment.
Dungeon Master 00:36:19 There was a split section when your arcane runes lit up that you were no longer fighting. But then, weirdly enough, they resumed a second later. We checked it out, seemed all in order, but just to make sure, as we do, in case one of the soldiers is in danger, one of the mages cast a scrying spell on you. Well, more importantly, it casted it on the armor that carries the rune that sort of tracks your vitals.
Dungeon Master 00:36:52 So I do, in fact, have fair knowledge of what happened in the tunnels. Now, let me explain a little bit more. Myself and myself alone was aware of Lansenx's position. He had gone missing a few weeks ago. I had sent him down there and I had seen his fall through a similar spell. I felt as though
Kaladin Shash 00:37:02 Can I just?
Dungeon Master 00:37:18 This would be a good testing opportunity for my three recruits who all have innate curse ability. It is not surprising then that you vanquished him. I imagine that is where your arcane runes triggered sort of our alert system in case you needed our help. What I did not know of was that there would be some woman there. I'm not entirely sure.
Dungeon Master 00:37:49 But once we started the scry, we seen her. And then, oddly enough, a single of my elite soldier group saw you on a dispatched mission and reported in that you were carrying her on the outskirts of the city. I'm just curious then what your intention was.
Kaladin Shash 00:38:19 Our intentions were pure. Our intention had no... We're not hiding anything. We're helping someone, that is all.
Dungeon Master 00:38:20 And he sits back into his chair. He holds his hand up just for like a pause to sort of interject because that is good to know at least.
Dungeon Master 00:38:49 But let me make myself clear. It is not acceptable for a team of new recruits to take it upon themselves to triage and sequester a potentially ill woman on their own. There is near unlimited magic at the core that we have access to to provide help. So I'm just curious, then, why you felt as though she was better off unattended to.
Kaladin Shash 00:39:20 Because she was perfectly stable, just as we found her. I don't know.
Dungeon Master 00:39:25 Do you think you could help her? I don't know if we could help her anymore, but I would bet on it if I were a betting man. Sort of.
Kaladin Shash 00:39:48 What did you see when you scryed on that? What specifically about this woman?
Dungeon Master 00:39:56 It wasn't that you found a woman, although I will say the part of your discussion where you were discussing the mask is intriguing to me. It's not something I've heard of before. Maybe a manifestation of her curse, maybe something else. What was worrying to me when I administered the scrying spell after your vitals went down, not yours, of course, was the instant
Kaladin Shash 00:40:23 Mr. Conrad's. But it also loved the Marshalls, if I recall.
Dungeon Master 00:40:26 decision. It was a complete lack of trust. Is there something we need to discuss? I'm sorry if I've given you the appearance of being untrusty. I will do this for you.
Kaladin Shash 00:40:49 You're very trustworthy. Again, we're just helping a woman out. That is it. What is this deal?
Dungeon Master 00:40:56 and I'm willing to overlook it, that I will make you a deal. You make the decision. You bring her into our facilities, we will run our tests, we will see if we can help her, or you can do it yourself in that tunnel, unhindered by my men. But I do feel that you're wrong.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:59 Bye.
Kaladin Shash 00:41:23 You're just giving me, okay, you're just giving me choice, is what you're saying.
Dungeon Master 00:41:29 It's up to you. I will remind you that the clerics are based in the core. The druids have representatives in the core. The mages have representatives in the core. That is all. You are dismissed. Oh, quickly, see to Ratchet about the rewards of the completion of your mission. As promised,
Zariel Torgan 00:41:48 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:41:54 You can get your pay or the boys have the ritual sort of routine they do with the drawing machine. It was fun when I participated it in my youth. So good luck if that's what you pick. Dismissed. And he ushers you away and goes back to his papers. To Zariel, you are sitting in the chair across from Captain Levi.
Kaladin Shash 00:42:05 Thank you, sir.
Dungeon Master 00:42:21 And he's got his, like, boots on, the table, head down. He's sort of just waiting. And you notice that he is refusing to speak. He is just staring at you, patiently waiting. He raises his eyebrow.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:35 Well, I've got a minus one charisma, so I'm going to look around and make sure there's not somebody else that's going to talk. And then, uh, after like a couple of minutes, if, if he's still, Oh, go ahead. Sorry.
Dungeon Master 00:42:51 No, he just raises his eyebrows at you, and he sees you looking around. He's like, not sure if he's giving the look of like, are you kidding me? Or if he's giving the look like, if it wasn't obvious enough, pay more attention to what I'm doing. Waiting.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:07 What's he doing? Oh. All right. After like a minute of awkward silence, I'll be like, uh, well, like I got these mushroom guys from, uh, the mission. Uh, yeah. Well, uh, uh, I have these, uh, bodies to show you if you'd like to see, um,
Kaladin Shash 00:43:09 I mean.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:37 I thought we did pretty good considering we're very new here and we don't know what to expect from each other as a working relationship. I feel we have delivered quite well. Would you like to see the mushrooms?
Dungeon Master 00:44:00 No, and I really would like to congratulate you on your mission there. I was briefed in at the last minute by Ratched. He told me how that all went down, which that's that's all fair and good. Just I am proud of you guys too. You guys are what been on the job long week now and you solved your first big case. That's that's pretty impressive. But.
Zariel Torgan 00:44:24 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:44:27 It's not really my place here to hand out the rewards. That's a little beneath my position. I got to oversee a lot of soldiers here. So I believe that Ratshit, as he's been aptly named by my men, he's handling that portion. It just has to wait for now. But continue. I'm loving your story.
Kaladin Shash 00:44:33 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:44:53 Uh, yeah, um, we'll, uh, I just will continue to give kind of like a really unenthusiastic, disjointed account of what happened until he interrupts me or, you know, recognizes that I'm not exactly the best guy at explaining stuff.
Dungeon Master 00:45:20 He doesn't seem like his expression doesn't read like pain of listening. His expression is more along the lines of as you're staring at him, he's. Like amused at the telling, but you can tell that he's waiting for something. But he doesn't stop you, he's listening to your story.
Kaladin Shash 00:45:25 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:44 Well, I finished telling the story, and I am not going to bring up the girl, because as far as I know, the plan was to wait until they mentioned something. And otherwise, we just weren't going to mention it at all. So if he doesn't bring it up, and he acts like he's going to keep waiting for something, then I'm just going to be like, and that's all I have to say about that.
Dungeon Master 00:46:18 Well, I appreciate your straightforwardness. You don't meander from the point of the store now, do you? Well, all right. That's all I have for you then. Nothing else you want to mention before I send you on your merry way?
Kaladin Shash 00:46:20 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:25 Can I do some sort of check to see if... He's obviously playing like he knows something, but I don't know whether he actually does or not. Can I make some sort of check to see whether or not I believe that he actually knows something?
Dungeon Master 00:46:49 You can give me two checks actually. We'll do double up here. You can do a history check on him as like how much would he have access to as a part of the Legionnaire.
Zariel Torgan 00:47:01 Okay. All right, I'll do first history, then insight. That's gonna be a six.
Dungeon Master 00:47:12 And then you can give me an insight check to read him at this moment of like, what is the nonverbal cues here? What does he throw in? OK. He's your boss, just as much as you know. Right. I love the dichotomy of those.
Zariel Torgan 00:47:29 for history. And then in it's gonna be a 23 for insight. Yeah, I don't know much but I know this.
Dungeon Master 00:47:41 As history goes, Captain Levi, he is a prominent enough figure where it's like, you've got the little crews of Legionnaire soldiers who work on individual assessments and missions and cases and all that stuff. And then you have like their superiors and then the superiors report to like, I forget the name that I gave them, but they're like, are in charge of, they're the regents. They're like, they're in charge of each district's management. And Captain Levi is like the regional
Dungeon Master 00:48:11 commander for the Storm District, which is why he's your highest boss. You know the only person he reports to is the Lord Marshal. So he's a pretty high-ranking figure, but that's about it. That's all you get. That's pretty common knowledge. And in Insight of 23, he
Zariel Torgan 00:48:24 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:48:34 That's pretty high. You can tell he's not going to press you for more information, and you can tell that he knows more than he's letting on. I think it would be an obvious connection for people to be like, he knows what I didn't tell him. But you don't read maliciousness behind it. He's got a different game going on. And as part of that game, he's taking your answer in.
Dungeon Master 00:49:02 It's like he's satisfied to an extent. You can tell that he's made a decision off of something. Whether or not Zariel, with his minus one, connects that, I'm going to leave that up to you for interpretation. But I'm just saying, like, he is alluding to the woman. You don't know how much he knows, but you know that he knows something.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:16 Yeah. OK.
Dungeon Master 00:49:24 And the fact that you didn't bring it up has been like, there were a couple routes for how he was going to handle things, and he's picked one, but it doesn't seem to be negatively impacting you. That's what you get with a pretty good role. So he just goes, all right then, we'll do any.
Kaladin Shash 00:49:31 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:46 Much obliged.
Dungeon Master 00:49:49 starts working on like you see he's got like uh some sort of clunky bracelet on his right hand that looks like pretty high tech for what anything you've seen like it's the cogs and wheels are pretty small there's like a lot of arcane runes on it and it seems to have sort of a mirror finish and you see he's like almost scrolling on the finished screen through different runes just like trying to figure it out and he's like you hear him go oh interesting
Dungeon Master 00:50:15 This needs a little work to cut clunky, and then like as you leave the door closes, you're just muffling behind the door. We're going to say that. Leopold was done first just because his was just storytelling and he had a good enough check that he wasn't like suspected of anything. The next. Soonest to be done would be Kaladin.
Dungeon Master 00:50:43 and then after that would have been Azaria. So you guys are like in the hall, you would be able to see each other, but like it's pretty far. So at this point, as you guys all sort of meet up, what do you do? There's like people passing through, but nobody's paying you any mind. You see like
Kaladin Shash 00:50:57 It's a hallway fairly is it private or we sort of just us.
Dungeon Master 00:51:05 Like two women with a bunch of paperwork in their hands discussing something as they just walk from one hallway to another. You see a couple new recruits getting fitted for armor, trying it on in a room to the side. It's a bustling area but nobody's staring at you because you made an entrance into an isolated space.
Kaladin Shash 00:51:28 Yeah, I think I would just whispered sort of gently and what did they ask you?
Zariel Torgan 00:51:39 Well, boys, I think, uh, I don't know how to say this. I didn't give up any information, but I'm fairly certain Levi knew about the woman.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:52 I knew we talked about not mentioning it and we were, we, you know, we decided on if we were asked that we would have that, you know, but, uh, he never asked me specifically, but I kind of feel like we should probably say something as a group. I just didn't want to say it until I talked to y'all about it. Cause they definitely know.
Dungeon Master 00:52:01 Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:52:16 Yes, the Lord Marshal knows everything. He performs crying spell. He could see me, but he'd hear what we were talking about. So he knows a lot. He does not know exactly what this mask was, that it was physical, but he knows the woman, and one of his own individuals within the Legionnaire saw us, and let him know.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:22 Troll.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:48 Well, I'm quite confident Ratshit knows nothing. See, I got him with this really good, good distraction technique. And after that, he was just off his game and he didn't, he didn't seem to push me about the woman. So I think we're in the clear, gents. Uh,
Kaladin Shash 00:52:56 Silence. Silence.
Dungeon Master 00:53:07 Leopold, do you want to name your new invention?
Leopold Magnus 00:53:14 Yeah, I think Leopold is probably modeling this after some of the fart devices he encountered as a young tyke. See, he was bullied quite a bit. And at the time, all of the students called it the Duty Maker. So he's not going to even think about what to name it. It'll just be the Duty Maker.
Dungeon Master 00:53:37 That's funny. I have a feeling this is not the first time we're going to see it. I wanted to give it a name.
Leopold Magnus 00:53:44 Might come back around.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:50 Well, boys, I think we need to go back in and talk to them about a game plan with this woman. If they're being coy.
Kaladin Shash 00:54:01 Well, the Lord Marshal let me know quite a bit. He said he was confused as to why if we were helping this person, we did not bring her to the court where all the healers and all of the magic knowers are. Of course not.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:16 Did you tell him that we heard a voice saying that somebody was coming for her, somebody that was a man, somebody that clearly this, oh, well. Hmm. Do you trust, do you trust his
Kaladin Shash 00:54:27 I did not mention these parts of it. This is why I'm very confused as to what they might understand. He said he only wanted to help out, but he also said he would be willing to look the other way. I did not perform insight check. I was very confused that he knew everything.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:44 response? Did he seem sincere? That's understandable. Yeah, it's understandable. Well, uh,
Kaladin Shash 00:54:57 It all happened so suddenly. It is the Lord of Marshall, but we also understand that there's some sort of greater magic occurring. How much history, above table again, when we understood that we're now in the year 1090, whatever it is,
Dungeon Master 00:55:05 Three different tactics.
Kaladin Shash 00:55:32 Our understanding of the previous ages are gone, they're wiped, right? Okay, no. Yep.
Dungeon Master 00:55:38 Yeah, you know very little. Like the common knowledge is that on the continent next to your guys is there is a huge war that basically decimated the entire planet with how much it was brought out. Through like a loophole of, like this is like almost religion it's so common knowledge, through a loophole of like
Dungeon Master 00:55:59 what kept the people alive. They were spared, but not reset. So like, as time was reversed and changed, like, the people living in the domes were unaffected. So like, then the domes were so far away from each other for so long, that through various things, like there was the fall of Aesoptera, where the curse sort of ravaged the city and everybody went to war. When Aesoptera attacked the Moon Haven, the Northern Dome,
Dungeon Master 00:56:28 like that waged a war in which the other three domes teamed up and took it out but then like people who had the curse but didn't know it sort of built into filtered into general populations which is why there's cursed people in each dome but it's also been so long that like the long-range communication runes and stuff like all the ways they had to talk to each other are like not present and
Zariel Torgan 00:56:42 Meh.
Dungeon Master 00:56:56 nobody really knows the state of what's going on. And that's the extent of common knowledge.
Kaladin Shash 00:56:56 Yeah. And then with our experiences with that girl, would we have observed that she appeared to be, you know, much higher percentages of any individual sort of trait race?
Leopold Magnus 00:56:58 So.
Dungeon Master 00:57:21 Interestingly enough, she looks wholly human. She doesn't seem to have fey features.
Kaladin Shash 00:57:27 Okay. Okay. Yeah. And then, so I guess back to the, where we were kind of making points in the conversation, I don't understand fully what, what they might be able to do assist us, or if they, they know more than they are letting us know about them. Very tricky.
Leopold Magnus 00:57:49 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:57:51 you
Zariel Torgan 00:57:51 Well, if they know all that, my vote is we go in, lay cards on the table, tell them about the voice, tell them about the warning, let them know that something is approaching. And we might, oh, go ahead.
Kaladin Shash 00:58:09 It's fine, Jonathan, can I, yeah. I was gonna ask if I could roll some sort of like, I don't know, insight check for myself just to get some sort of gut feeling or response to that laying our cards on the table or continuing to hide individual, if that gave me any sort of guidance. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:58:26 I think that's gotta be a you decision. You can, you know, counsel with your party about what they think is the right decision as well, and you can do it out of character, but I know the correct answer and I can't tell you that.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:31 Heh heh heh
Kaladin Shash 00:58:42 Now, yes, I feel strongly that we should protect this individual. I don't know if turning her over is a good idea or not.
Leopold Magnus 00:58:57 Well, indeed, the Legion has demonstrated to be quite powerful. Maybe it's best we poke around and if this Magnus Thorogood character is a true straight shooter, he might tell us what they are up to. Alright, that was Thorogood. Isn't that his name?
Zariel Torgan 00:59:16 Just there. Can I?
Dungeon Master 00:59:17 Who? Oh, it's just T-H-U-R, Thur. T-H-U-R. Just Thur.
Kaladin Shash 00:59:18 Zoriel, do you see you? Thurgos. What is his name? Thurgos, yeah. T-H-O-R-G-O-S, Thur? Okay, but Lord Marthal Thur.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:28 Oh, Turgo, OK. Third, third, OK. Lord Marshall, third.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:45 Can I throw up a fairy fire real fast? Yeah, just all around us. Okay. I'm looking for a scrying orb.
Dungeon Master 00:59:50 Yeah. Just like in this open space. Go for it. What are you looking for? Do you have this full description right there, right?
Zariel Torgan 01:00:13 Yeah, it says, let's see here. Each object is outlined in a blue, green, or violet light of my choice. Any creature in the area is also outlined. I infer that it says any creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.
Dungeon Master 01:00:23 Yeah. You throw up a sky, you don't see anything immediately around you. But like, interestingly enough, there are like, what looks like just unlit lights on like the corners of the rooms, and like various places down the hall. And in each of those sort of like,
Dungeon Master 01:00:54 light bulb areas you see a scry orb just placed in like a primitive security system just like monitoring the area but you don't see anything like around you.
Zariel Torgan 01:01:08 Alright. Well, if we are deciding to handle this in-house, perhaps discussion should be at a different location. And then I'll drop it because I'm sure it's just like
Zariel Torgan 01:01:33 obvious there's this giant light thing happening in the square around us. So I'll just drop it right after. So I imagine that, so it's, I think it's just verbal. Yeah, it's just verbal. So I'll say the command word, and then
Dungeon Master 01:01:37 Oh yeah, like everything is lit up and everybody around you, like what is your magic manifest as? Like what color does it go? What's its shape? This is the first time we really get to see it.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:02 Like when you're cycling on a lens and it picks up a little bit of that rainbow iridescent for a second before it comes into focus, everything just kind of just goes out of focus for a second and comes back with that oil sheen, iridescent hue, just brightly bordering everything around, especially those little orbs.
Dungeon Master 01:02:10 Mm-hmm Life, um, yeah, it's just like you guys see this like wash of like
Dungeon Master 01:02:34 just all of the colors iridescently and they just like all expand very quickly and then you just like almost have more focus of the things that are outlined by it like they are like compared to the background they're just like sharper and more in focus and you all see these sort of like just orbs placed regularly through like the corner of the ceiling and the wall
Zariel Torgan 01:03:00 And then I'll drop it after like three or four seconds, just enough to get a clock of everything.
Dungeon Master 01:03:06 Everything sort of washes back to normal. After a moment, you see his scrawny, tall, gaunt self, the half-orc that's known as Ratchet. I forget what he was called originally at this point. I'd have to check. But he is walking up and he goes, right then, are you guys ready for the payment?
Leopold Magnus 01:03:14 Bye.
Kaladin Shash 01:03:32 Yes, I have a question. Let me know, what do we get for cash, and what is this lottery? What is this possible price?
Zariel Torgan 01:03:32 Absolutely.
Dungeon Master 01:03:41 I'm fucking glad you asked. Follow me, gents. And as he's walking again, he goes, right. So the fucking lottery has been around as almost as long as a legionnaire, right? When we were first on our missions, early days, there was still a heavy influence of arcane magic. People had a lot of cool shit. So anything that was sort of confiscated as part of like, you know, battles and raids and busts and all that.
Dungeon Master 01:04:06 You just sort of went to waste, and there's some unique shit in there. So we draw on a lottery of what you just randomly get, but as part of that, you donate a portion of your pay. Most of it, in fact. For this mission, your guys' gold would be 250 units a person, but if you choose a token and the payment, you get 62 of the gold and you get 50 of the silver. So it just sort of cuts it down by a portion.
Dungeon Master 01:04:34 But you have to make the decision beforehand. You can't go, oh, the item I got isn't good enough. I want the full pay.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:48 Well, I think I'd like to try my hand at this here lottery. Seems like fun. Did you say there was an option where you get just the lottery and maybe it's something better? Or is it only lottery and pay?
Dungeon Master 01:05:09 no no you take you take a quarter pay and then or a third pay more closely on this split but then you get that gold and a token and then you expend the token at the storeroom all right and so he um
Leopold Magnus 01:05:13 you
Kaladin Shash 01:05:18 Silence.
Zariel Torgan 01:05:23 Mmm. I think I'll do that one.
Dungeon Master 01:05:32 pulls out he's got this like really nice finely crafted black leather like coin purse that's fairly large and he reaches into it and he pulls out a bag of exactly 62 gold 50 silver drops it in your hand and then from his back pocket he pulls out like this crudely hand cut like octagonal coin in thickness and it's just got like a mystery
Dungeon Master 01:05:58 like a question mark written over the sides of it. So hold on to that. That'll be exchanged when you have it. Rooting for you. That's sort of the benefit of going on more missions is you get more chances at the lottery. A new gentleman, your decision. He gets a devil and he's like, I fucking love it. And he gives you your gold and your token.
Kaladin Shash 01:06:12 Very good. I'll be doing the same. I'm feeling quite lucky today.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:27 I would say gambling is for the losing man, but I think I'll prefer to keep my winners and let them ride, so I will put my pay on it too.
Dungeon Master 01:06:40 Love it. I knew you guys were fucking cool. It gives you each the gold and the token so you can add 62 gold, 50 silver. And then you can either add the item in and like just have to create the whole thing or you can just in your head know you have the token. Wait. No.
Zariel Torgan 01:06:41 That works. In my head, though, I have three. No? Oh, thought I'd try that.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:09 Jonathan, it was 62 gold and how much silver?
Dungeon Master 01:07:13 50 silver. And he goes, oh, and then also Captain Levi had mentioned you picked up a pretty powerful weapon in the fight too. Not sure how he knows it, but the man's pretty good at his job. I was given special instructions for you, Kaladin, Lord Marshal Thurin,
Dungeon Master 01:07:41 It suggests that you take it to ham hock. She might be able to make it a little more manageable for the party. It's pretty large and obnoxious right now. Yeah. He goes, right then, you sort of get a little bit of R&R at this point, so take a beater. Do what you will with your win-ins.
Kaladin Shash 01:07:49 Yeah, the club that uses stuff that we're talking about. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:08:09 Settle in a little bit more, I guess, but then I've got another assignment for you in a few days report then for that. All right.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:20 I'm just going to take the gold he gives me and, uh, dump it kind of down my, my helmet. You kind of hear me rattling around a little bit when I move. Why are you so down about that? I think we'll be doing just fine out there. Our first mission was a screaming success.
Kaladin Shash 01:08:26 Excellent. To the floor.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:34 We are never going to sneak up on anything, ever, on any mission. We're walking around with a... You are a birthday cake away from being a piñata. So loud.
Dungeon Master 01:08:39 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:01 Well, I can't really say. I had many birthdays, you know. I was kind of second fiddle to my brother. But anyways, yes, of course. I understand.
Zariel Torgan 01:09:15 Or do you say we go down and see if we get anything good for our tokens?
Kaladin Shash 01:09:20 Yes, let us go to the storeroom. We did quite well. We will cash in. Trust me, my friends.
Dungeon Master 01:09:31 No way it goes bad.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:31 Gallatin just has a gambling problem.
Dungeon Master 01:09:36 Okay, yeah, as you guys make your way, like, just past the barracks, like, through the mess hall and into the back room, because there's a lot of guys sitting there, like, on their kegs, they're bullshitting, they're chatting with their buddies. There's, like, one of the other soldier has, like, his fiddle out, and he's just, like, playing a little ditty, like, on his chair with his feet kicked up, and the vibes are pretty good in here. There's, like, an active bar, and then you see this large cylindrical, like, black
Dungeon Master 01:10:03 iron-framed with like an opaque glass that has like blue energy behind it. It looks like a concentration of like what comes out of the top of the core, like that giant beam of energy. And you see like at the front of it is like an actual slot that has like a coin slot at the front and a like lever in the bottom. Yeah, and so everybody's chilling out. You see like a dude standing in line and he spins the machine and the whole thing like
Kaladin Shash 01:10:17 Oh, it's a giant vending machine.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:26 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:10:33 It glows really loud and you hear... And then it just... And you see, pops out into his hand is like a little tiny ring. And he goes, oh, geez, I wonder what it is. And he goes, he sits down with his friends and it seems like he's looking at it and like in the process of what would be like attuning it, you know, like figuring it out. And then everybody's like sort of patting him on the back. He gets some whistles, some guys boo. And that's sort of the scene as you guys enter in here.
Kaladin Shash 01:11:03 Yes, I will walk. I will walk straight up and put my coin in the slot. Boy. Oops, didn't mean to do that. Where's my regular key? Just clicking stuff here. Where's my key? Check out my information. All right, here we go. D100.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:03 We're all gonna get PEZ dispensers. Oh man. That's good to know.
Dungeon Master 01:11:11 Okay, go ahead and roll me a D100. It's pretty dexterous, you guys.
Kaladin Shash 01:11:39 Uh, okay. Okay. 69. Just, just so. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:11:42 That's nice. Okay, this is, this is very cool. The whole thing lights up. And like it goes.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:44 Nice! That's great. Better be something awesome.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:44 Dinner for two.
Dungeon Master 01:12:07 and popping out right in front of you and then it sort of hovers in space waiting for you to grab it you see a like black steel ring that has like you know abalone that material sort of running in a band in the center. And you can just tell instantly that it's got like a pretty heavy enchant on it.
Kaladin Shash 01:12:22 All right, yeah, I just pick it up, and I'll begin to sort of do, or maybe I'll ritual cast. No, I'll just try to attune with it. I'll just see what it does.
Leopold Magnus 01:12:25 Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:12:43 Okay. Who's up next? And while I'll look to see if I can get the item into your inventory. I might need to make it. I didn't check. It's so polite.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:48 Well, why don't we Rochambeau for it? And I'll roll you. We'll do rollies. This is a D20.
Kaladin Shash 01:12:51 Sweet. OK.
Leopold Magnus 01:12:55 Oh, yes, Zariel. Are you, um... Well, are you wanting to put your coin in there, or shall I? Okay. What do you want to roll? Okay. Ah, 16. Okay, so then I would win?
Zariel Torgan 01:13:18 So I got a 12. So this is just rock, paper, scissors. Yeah, you got paper, I got rock. Oh, well, you always were better at this sort of thing. Why don't you go ahead and step right up? I've got a feeling it's gonna be something good for you.
Leopold Magnus 01:13:36 Well, indeed, I hope so. And I take the coin out, kind of cough it out of my visor. It kind of falls out of the main slit of my helmet. And I look at it just one last time, and I drop it down the slot. Oh, there it is. It's going to be 82.
Dungeon Master 01:13:52 Give me that D100 roll. Can I be me? OK, you get. I think this is fitting for your character too.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:59 69. Ha ha ha.
Dungeon Master 01:14:16 The whole thing lights up. It makes that big whirring sound. It has the ching! And popping out of the spout is a coin. You see it doesn't quite fit in the slot. It's not the right type of coin.
Leopold Magnus 01:14:27 Well, Zario, I think this thing might be broken. And I just drop the coin back into the slot. Oh, what the hell? It spot my coin back out. I'm just really trying to jam it in there. I realize that maybe it's a different coin.
Kaladin Shash 01:14:34 Three.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:35 Bye!
Dungeon Master 01:14:47 You get this coin in here and this coin doesn't have anything on either face. It's like just a very polished silver coin. Okay, and then last
Leopold Magnus 01:14:57 Hmm. Oh dear, I think this thing is broken. Ugh. And I just toss it down my gullet. I, like, kind of deposited it through my mouth slit. Just goes, jing, ding.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:08 Is there a chance I gotta look at this coin before he just haphazardly chucks it in his gut? Wait, Leo, that might be something cool. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:15:14 Um, yeah, like what I described is what you would see at like any distance. It's just like a very polished silver coin. It's pretty large, but there's no markings on it at all that would even be like this is currency. It's just a coin.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:33 Oh, you think so, Zario, huh? And I kind of look down at it, fiddle with it in my hands. Well, indeed, it is strange. There's nothing on either side. What do you think it is? Hmm. Yes.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:43 Well, I think that we have the benefit of our group. This here, Kaladin, he seems to be able to identify things with great accuracy. Maybe have him take a look.
Kaladin Shash 01:15:56 Just give me some, give me a little time and we will be able to tell you.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:01 Okay, indeed. Well, maybe I came away with something more than just another coin. I was starting to get quite disappointed at first.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:12 Don't worry, I bet it's something very interesting. And then I'll walk up and I'll drop mine in there and give a little finger cross. All right, here it comes. Oh, that was almost one.
Dungeon Master 01:16:18 All righty, Zario, last but not least. Let's see it, let's see it. 41.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:43 half of what Leo got. Is it half a coin?
Leopold Magnus 01:16:47 Half of a coin. That's great.
Kaladin Shash 01:16:47 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:16:49 No, the whole thing worse, it spins up and lights go flashed and chain and falling out of it is a basic, like you like basic iron ring, but it's basic in the sense that it's got like the hammer marks on it still it's not like dirty or crude or sharp, but like it was polished up looking relatively like on super finished.
Zariel Torgan 01:17:13 Well, this looks like it's got character. I'll get in line for Kaladin so we can use his abilities.
Leopold Magnus 01:17:26 Why indeed, Jario.
Dungeon Master 01:17:35 Okay. Sweet. We'll give it in order then. The one he started working on first. Kaladin, your very nicely finished ring is known as Ring of the Grammarian. It is a legendary item that is required attunement by a spellcaster. While wearing this ring, you can alter one letter in the title of a spell that you are casting to create a different effect.
Zariel Torgan 01:17:53 Damn. Jesus fucking Christ.
Kaladin Shash 01:17:56 Oof.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:01 Thanks a lot.
Dungeon Master 01:18:03 For example, crafting the spell Cause Fear, you can alternate it to be Cause Bear. The spell's School of Magic changes to fit the nature of the new spell, and the DM has great latitude in ruling of the new spell. You can change the spell components, range, casting time, and level as it is see fit. If you do not have a spell slot of the required spell to cast it, the spell fails.
Dungeon Master 01:18:28 The slot is used and the spell is wasted, yada yada. Once used, the ring cannot be used until the next dawn. It doesn't exist yet, so I'll have to like actually made it. It's just off of a thing I found. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:18:37 That's okay, that's pretty fun. I'm gonna have to look at all of my, I'll look at all of my things and see what I can spell. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:39 That's awesome. You could get up to some pretty crazy shit with that, I bet.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:41 Oh my god. That's sweet. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:18:58 You can cast Fleet instead of Sleep, you know? Steel instead of Steep. Anything that has a weird name as a title, you can just change it to be really harmful or really easy.
Kaladin Shash 01:19:12 I did. I did.
Zariel Torgan 01:19:12 Yeah, like Nice Knife or Porn Whip. Yeah, I know. Yeah, they all have to be just really gross. Yeah. It's just a thirsty ring. Oh, man.
Leopold Magnus 01:19:19 Oh, that's good. I mean, you did get it from a 69 on that D100, so. A porn whip seems about right. They're all super horny. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:19:40 And then next up, Leopold, as the coin is in your stomach, you attune to it. It doesn't require attunement, but you sort of get a feel for it. It'll be more fun than just getting identified. This is called the all or nothing coin. When the coin is flipped, runes light up on each side determining
Dungeon Master 01:20:05 in place of an Attack Roll, Ability Check, or Saving Throw. Instead, you can flip this coin in place of Rolling D20, Heads is treated as a 20, while Tails is treated as a 1. The coin cannot be used until the next Dawn. On any Attack Roll, Ability Check, or Saving Throw, you instead flip a coin, and the Heads is a natural 20, and Tails is the natural 1.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:19 Awesome.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:20 Okay, so I would flip that coin, and then... Uh-huh. Okay, and what happens when I roll that dice, if I get a 15-nothing? Like if I got a number other than one or 20?
Dungeon Master 01:20:42 When you get a what? No, you would physically like flip a coin. It's like absolute hit or absolute miss.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:50 Oh, oh, I see, okay. Okay, that's cool, I get it. Right, yep. Okay, got it.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:59 Yeah, or you could just roll another d20 and then 1 through 10 is a tails and 11 through 20 is a heads or something like that. But if you had a physical coin, that'd be fun too.
Dungeon Master 01:21:13 And then the last one, Zariel, as it gets identified in front of you, it is called Ring of the Giant Slayer. You gain a plus one to AC and plus one bonus to attack rolls against creatures of the size large or larger. That bonus, it comes up plus two against creatures of the giant type.
Kaladin Shash 01:21:32 Cool. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:32 Damn. Nice. I could definitely use that. Yeah. It's all relative. Nice. Very cool. Very cool.
Leopold Magnus 01:21:41 Now you just need to get tiny. Got it.
Dungeon Master 01:21:46 not larger than him of large or larger. Very nice guys. Okay. And then as you were sort of explained to you, you have essentially like a few days, a downtime days. And the only one who has a direct
Dungeon Master 01:22:05 sort of task at this point is Paladin who's got like a request to take that sort of club into Hamhock to get like adjusted.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:05 Yeah, I wouldn't mind trying to get like a shield or something. My AC is terrible.
Leopold Magnus 01:22:22 It would go along with Kaladin if he's headed to Hamhawk. Chat Hamhawk up a bit.
Kaladin Shash 01:22:32 Yes. Yes, you feel the money in your pocket, my friend. Let's go.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:39 Yeah, I've made more in the one day of killing mushrooms than I made in multiple months of working in the Corps. Well, at least they were paying me. I think they thought you were parts.
Leopold Magnus 01:22:52 Hmm, Zaria, I suppose you should have found a better job, to be honest. Oh, yes, indeed. But you know, back at the palace, even the cook used to make a better living than that.
Kaladin Shash 01:23:10 Peter. What I would like. Yes, I would like.
Zariel Torgan 01:23:10 What are you saying? You're dropping this lore like it's stuff we already know. You need to just tell me if you know stuff about yourself. Do you remember more than before? Wait, hang on. You just said you don't remember anything. And then you said that you've been at a palace.
Leopold Magnus 01:23:23 Well, what do you mean, remember more? No, I don't know anything about what's happening. I'll just say it, but at the palace, they did pay more than that. Oh, I don't know. I mean, I don't, I don't, I couldn't tell you to be honest.
Zariel Torgan 01:23:39 Those are two mutually exclusive thoughts. Good question.
Kaladin Shash 01:23:42 Leo, what was the year when you were in the palace? Don't remember. Who were your masters? What were their names? Who? What palace was this, Leo?
Leopold Magnus 01:23:57 Well, I wouldn't be able to say much about masters. Who are they? I don't, I mean, I just was in the tube and Zariel came and woke me up. But I do remember they paid more at the palace. So you should have found a job there. Well, it was quite a nice place. Yes. Yeah. I had my study. It was nice. I remember that.
Kaladin Shash 01:24:20 Was it your palace? Leo, what color hair do you have?
Zariel Torgan 01:24:20 What did, yeah, what did you study?
Leopold Magnus 01:24:25 Well, some tomes, you know, the history of the decades, wars in the past. I enjoyed a good tale or two. There was some quite good dramas on the shelves, I remember that. And I go on describing basically every book you could ever find in a library. Oh, yes. Hmm? Oh, I...
Leopold Magnus 01:24:51 Well, I do remember my brother Victor. He blonde, I would say. Yes. I don't know. I never took care of myself very well, so I never paid attention to those details.
Kaladin Shash 01:24:57 What color was your hair? Interesting. I'm very confused about your friend here, Zahariel. Is he? He appears soft.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:07 Well, yes, well, he's becoming more complex as the days go by. Yes, let's see what Ham Hawk has to say.
Leopold Magnus 01:25:22 Well indeed, Zariel. You're worth more. Let's, uh, trudge on.
Kaladin Shash 01:25:36 And then this is back into the storm district. That's where we're heading, right? Sweet. It's a cool workshop.
Dungeon Master 01:25:39 Yes. As you guys come over, you make it to the building. And then let me load up. I actually made a map for this one. It's easy to find online. That's the easy stuff.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:55 Nice. Ham hock!
Leopold Magnus 01:25:56 Yeah, you've been killing it with the maps. Did you find a picture of Hamlock by chance?
Kaladin Shash 01:26:10 Come on. Yeah, can we put that into the chat?
Dungeon Master 01:26:18 Yeah, if you recognize it, it is for a character in the show. Critical role. So that's that was like a really good picture, I thought anyway, so picture that like a very large woman who looks like that.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:29 Yeah. Pretty. Great, thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:26:30 That's funny.
Kaladin Shash 01:26:44 That's fun. Do we see anything along the way, or is it pretty uneventful? We're just walking over it, no issue. OK. Can we just walk into the shop?
Dungeon Master 01:26:53 Just uneventful, you just have to go from the core to like basically the entrance of it. If you can, I know I wrote the name of it down somewhere, but I don't have it on me right now.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:09 So, I mean, add a character above table just to the guys. We have to go see that woman, right? Like, we have to go, like, quick. I mean, we just left her in a tunnel. I mean, if we're not going to tell them and have them help us, at the very least, we need to be, like, actively working on getting her conscious, right?
Kaladin Shash 01:27:32 Yeah, I just wanted to take care of the one task I was tasked with for this rest day interval before we took care of that. Yes, we will. We will be brief.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:40 Okay, all right. I just, yeah. Yeah. Um, well, why don't we, why don't we finish this up just because I wanted to see about, like, you know, a shield or something, or I don't know. I don't even know if I can wield a shield.
Leopold Magnus 01:27:40 I suppose that you and I could go check in on her, because yeah, right? She just stopped in some random-ass tunnel, right? Yeah, that's probably pertinent.
Kaladin Shash 01:28:03 And I agree, we should go see about this woman in the mask. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:10 Well, I suppose she was down in a dank and dark cave. There's probably not much difference between that and the tunnel we stuffed her in.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:19 I would imagine there's probably less deadly mushrooms in where she's at now, but still. Anyway, well let's go into Hamhawks and see what they've got for us. Hamhawk was a they, right?
Dungeon Master 01:28:41 She's got a bow in the top of her head, where her little tuft of hair sticks out. People had referred to Ham Hock pretty vaguely at first, which is why you didn't know to expect who you saw. But not like, not asexual or anything, yeah. Just very ogre-esque in heritage.
Kaladin Shash 01:28:42 Really? Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:47 Oh, I thought somebody in-game called her a they, but okay, nevermind. Oh, okay. Now it seems pretty clear it's a lady. Okay. Yeah. Alright. Well then I guess we'll head in?
Kaladin Shash 01:29:13 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:29:18 Perfect. You guys walk in, you hear just like enchanted on, like a speaking stone hanging on the wall, some music is just playing.
Dungeon Master 01:29:29 uh just some passive stuff and you hear some like tinkering and hammer and some flames go off in like the room next and as you peek around the corner you see ham hock has got like an arcane flame on a tool sort of over like this big sort of like just frame at this point it doesn't really have a shape or anything but it's long and cylindrical and it's
Dungeon Master 01:29:50 It steeps down at one point, but there's nothing impressive about it yet. But then it has a little tinkering hammer, and you hear the tink, tink, tink, tink, and you hear an enchant go off to it at the same time. And Hamhawk just seems to be tapping her foot on the ground as she works away at this thing. Do you announce yourselves, or is it just a walk up until she notices you?
Kaladin Shash 01:30:14 Yeah, just kind of wandering staring around. Carrying this very large club.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:17 I think Leopold would spot Hamhawk working on something and just wander over and just stare. I'm going to try and study or investigate what she's doing to maybe glean a little bit of information. And if I spot something, I'll ask her about it.
Dungeon Master 01:30:40 Yeah, as you guys walk up, sort of just looking and you look very specifically at what she's building, you see him on camera and he goes, oh hey, it's good to see you guys again. I was actually expecting you to show up at some point. I was told you have something for me to alter.
Kaladin Shash 01:30:58 Yes, we found this in a cave. It is a little messy, it always drips.
Dungeon Master 01:31:03 Oh, fucking lovely. I love modifying shit like this. And you see, with one hand easily, she picks it up out of your grip and sort of looks it over, turning it almost like a turkey drumstick in her hand, just sort of like... And I was told just on special orders it was placed actually for you, Kaladin. Do you want anything specific done with this? I got an idea in my head, but not sure what you're looking for.
Kaladin Shash 01:31:34 What was the idea you had and what were the orders you had received? Okay. Above table, was that like an iron that's dripping out of there, some sort of poison or what is it?
Dungeon Master 01:31:37 I don't know. That's uh, like, that's a secret. My tricks aren't supposed to be known. It's just like a magical effect of like what the weapon does as far as you know. Like,
Dungeon Master 01:32:03 It's got magical properties and that manifest is like it weeps like black sludge. Thanks.
Kaladin Shash 01:32:03 So it just sort of weeps. OK, OK, OK. I would show her my quarterstaff. And let her know I want something closer to a spear or something that could. With mechanics.
Zariel Torgan 01:32:10 Weep is a good, that's a good descriptor.
Kaladin Shash 01:32:33 alter its length like telescope, but still be very sturdy. Keeping the fist and the spear that I have right now, like the bronze or whatever it is on those ends, feel I guess maybe.
Dungeon Master 01:32:39 Mm-hmm. Right, I can work with this. Do you want me to alter your current one? I was thinking of doing something like just like shaving down the sides of this club and making it a little more weasel-dible by somebody like you, but I could change this up instead.
Kaladin Shash 01:33:08 What would the advantage be to having that one shortened out? Can it's magical properties be put into this? Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:33:13 Into what? Your thing? I could sort of, with time, it'll take like a couple days to get it totally done, but I could transfer the magical essence using an arcane transfuser. I've got one in the back I could fire up, but it's a long process. I got to sort of absorb one, concentrate it, do loop down the material, and transfer it into the other.
Kaladin Shash 01:33:40 That's just fine.
Dungeon Master 01:33:43 All right, well, I'll take over. You're a fine lady down here. I won't even sort of waste your time with it like it is truly just like it's like a triangular frame like you don't know at this point you cannot ascertain anything about it. It is just like.
Leopold Magnus 01:33:54 So Jonathan, could I roll to do like an arcana check to see what she was working on?
Dungeon Master 01:34:13 bare bones, a couple cross beams, the main frame. It's like bolted and bolted together at certain spots, but like there's nothing else to it. Even with your class in general, you would know that those are like tinkering tools. You make them like a tinkerer can create the tools they need for a certain task just by focusing it at some point.
Leopold Magnus 01:34:22 Okay, and the hammer, the enchantment with the hammer that wasn't like imbuing it with a specific. Got it. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:34:40 That's like something that you would learn in the future. So this is just like a tinkering tool that she has seemed to have made for whatever task she's working on. And the other one just seems like the blowtorch equivalent of having like a very concentrated burning hands on it, just like the very tip focused in so she could like put together pieces and things like that. Yeah, got a welding torch.
Leopold Magnus 01:35:04 It's like a welding torch, basically. Yep, got it. Okay, cool. Oh, yes, Leopold Magnus, at your service.
Dungeon Master 01:35:13 But then she does look at you and she goes, it's Leo, right? Gotcha, Leo. Listen, you seem kind of interested in this stuff. You were inquiring a lot last time. So how would you like to work on this project I've got here?
Leopold Magnus 01:35:32 Oh, me? Wow, well, why, that would be quite intriguing. I do indeed love learning. What'd you have in mind? Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:35:40 Perfect. Well, first you got to do the dirty work. And then after we get all the materials, you can hang out with me and I'll teach you some stuff about, you know, this modern arcane technology. I'm coming. I'm on the cutting edge. You know, you're kind of working with the virtuoso of her trade, if I do say so myself. Nope. I said I'd help you. I'll let you help with this one.
Kaladin Shash 01:35:55 I guess that's the sound.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:57 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:35:58 Okay. Wow. Why? Wow. You're taking on apprentices? Is that what I hear? Oh, okay. Well, yes, I suppose I better not get too hasty. Well, indeed, I'm a hard worker. I'm well book-read, you know. I'm a go-getter.
Dungeon Master 01:36:13 But yeah, that's all good. Yeah. We'll test out your skills. First and foremost, like I said, there's a blueprint back there on the wall. It's marked right there. Project Splitter is what it's called, titled as. If you don't mind going and fetching the means to get this project going, I'd appreciate it. And then I'll teach you what I'm going to do with it.
Leopold Magnus 01:36:40 OK, yes, indeed. Leopold Magnus, at your service. And I zoom off to the blueprint.
Zariel Torgan 01:36:49 You know, I've got to try that in... Yeah, I was just gonna say, I gotta try that in real life where I hear somebody say something and I just respond like they said what I wanted them to say, even if they didn't. Just like, oh, you want to give me that money? And they're like, no, that's not what I... Oh, I'll take it. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:36:49 You just go right over to the wall and grab it. Just the confidence to force what you want.
Kaladin Shash 01:37:00 You.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:18 That's great. Go ahead, sorry.
Leopold Magnus 01:37:20 No, that's it. I was grabbing the blueprint. I'll be Hamhawk's apprentice, whether or not she likes it or not. Okay. And is that like a shopping list of items I'm gonna need to find?
Dungeon Master 01:37:34 Okay, I have added into your, I put it in equipment, but it really should just go to your backpack, your blueprint. Yeah, you can read it out. You can read it out if you'd like. It's in your backpack. I moved it to where it should be, because it's just technically like an item.
Leopold Magnus 01:37:49 I just kind of take a look at it, inspect it a little bit. Okay. I don't see it in there. What's it called? Oh, okay.
Dungeon Master 01:38:07 Did you reload your page? It's called Blueprint Arcane Splitter.
Kaladin Shash 01:38:09 Cool.
Leopold Magnus 01:38:29 Oh yeah, okay. So it's created by Hamhawk to split the arcane dome wide enough to fit a small group through. Needs to be stable, non-dangerous, capable of being activated and deactivated. Requires a dispel magic enchantment. Cast multiple times over multiple days, three days. Anti-magic field spell cast once into a runelock. 100 gold pounds and 100 gold pounds worth of diamond dust.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:37 Mmm.
Leopold Magnus 01:38:59 rune set from a library special request item from Hamhawk handled by lead binder Geront. So yeah, I read this out, and I say, why? This is quite the quest Hamhawk has given us. And I pass it around to the group, and I say, I don't know why we'd want to go outside the dome. I don't know if there's much to see, but it could come in handy.
Kaladin Shash 01:39:00 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 01:39:10 Yes. There's like the market district has got
Kaladin Shash 01:39:31 Would we feel like we would understand where to get all of these items? Or I mean, this might, would, right? Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:39:31 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:39:40 like more than enough for that. You like ask about it before you go, and Hammock goes, oh, yeah, right, sorry. This is on the bill of the core. So just like, here's this path, and you see she like tosses you a scroll that's got like, you know, bill of the core. She goes, I will be collecting at the end. If you try to take it, I will break your fingers. Approved payments only for these materials only.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:01 Well, that sounds pretty interesting. Let me see here.
Kaladin Shash 01:40:01 Okay, okay.
Kaladin Shash 01:40:30 Zoriel, did you get your protection yet?
Zariel Torgan 01:40:30 Ham Hawk. Yeah, I'll ask her real fast. Pardon me, Miss Ham Hawk. I was noticing that when I was in battle with the thing, I was getting hit a lot and it hurt.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:00 Do you have something that might help me not get hit so much? I mean I can take a lot of hits but if I could like be a little faster or have something I could block it with or like I don't know I'm not really the critical thinking type but
Dungeon Master 01:41:00 Yikes. Sounds like it hurts. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Sorry. Listen, kid, you're real nice and all, but I can't do that. My job is to get you suited up with your first set of gear.
Kaladin Shash 01:41:01 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:41:29 And then we get you to go in and then I'm on special request only. I work for the High Council and like the Legionnaire as a whole. It's not a shop and I don't just give stuff away unless I'm told to. But you could go buy a shield from any number of Smithies.
Kaladin Shash 01:41:30 Right.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:53 Oh, ah, gotcha. I was under the impression it was like a free-for-all, like, you know, you were like messing with his rod and shaving it down, and you're like, he's your apprentice, he's your apprentice now, I hear, which is cool, but... I heard...
Kaladin Shash 01:42:05 Okay. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:42:07 Right, but that's like... No, not in my apprentice. That's absolutely not happening. He gets... There was a request put in from Lord Marshal Suhr to fashion this weapon for him. I don't know much more than that. I don't...
Leopold Magnus 01:42:16 Well, yes I am! I am at your service! And I, uh... I, like, snap out the blueprint, and I'm looking at it very, uh, intently.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:28 Ooh alright. I just, I heard it was… yeah alright. Oh no, I was mistaken. I heard it was official. You know, he's already got business cards so I mean it's… I heard it was pretty official. I'll…
Dungeon Master 01:42:34 And I just needed a shopping guy, so that's why I gave him that. So like, you know, it's totally fine. It's not, it's cool, it's cool. You know, I get it. Absolutely stop that or I will sue you.
Leopold Magnus 01:42:51 A little printer whirls behind my mouth and it just spits out a business card and I start handing them out.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:00 He's very industrious. I'll go. I'll go. Cease and desist. I'll go get that shield somewhere else. Thank you. Thank you, Ham Hawk. I appreciate all you do for us and what you've done. Good day. Good day. All right. Sounds good.
Dungeon Master 01:43:20 What trauma I fucking love it. Uh, yeah, we'll see uh, see you guys when you get the stuff No, I mean like I could have made the club a lot more manageable by end of day for sure that's not a hard task but uh
Kaladin Shash 01:43:28 Hamhawk, when we return, will my stuff be ready, or will we need to wait a longer time?
Dungeon Master 01:43:43 To combine them together, it's gonna take a couple days. I haven't quite figured it out. It depends on how magical this thing is to begin with. I gotta run some tests, alter designs. You know, the stuff. Yeah, I mean, I got a machine that actually legit just does it. It just takes a little bit.
Kaladin Shash 01:43:57 OK, but you can do it's not no big deal. You can do it though, OK? OK, we'll be back in two days for that. You will come back. We will come back with release. Don't worry.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:07 to a
Dungeon Master 01:44:12 or sooner with my list. Don't forget about the list. Stop saying that. I will sue you. Listen, you little shit. I'm just kidding.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:18 Well, I am the number one ham hock apprentice, so I will have these in right tight order, best and proper.
Kaladin Shash 01:44:27 Yeah. Yeah, we can we. Can. Can we go check on the girl and then we can go shopping? Yes, perhaps we should go back to our tunnel.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:42 Yeah, let's do it. Yeah, I would agree. Let's get down there and see if we can't get this thing figured.
Dungeon Master 01:44:43 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:02 Aye, indeed.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:08 So do we want to just say we get there or do we want to make any stops along the way or? Mm hmm. OK.
Kaladin Shash 01:45:17 Um I just figured for expediency. I mean we could just go to the tunnel Because shopping sounds very close to ham hock shop. So we guys we came back. We can just shop Yeah Yeah, yeah
Dungeon Master 01:45:29 It's like the other side of the dome, but you can get there pretty easily through the core. Okay, I'll hold you to it. Please.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:36 Alright, let's stop off and see her, and I think... I guess we'll talk more when we get down there. Because I don't want to say too much about here.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:49 I'll be right back, Hamhawk. Oh, indeed.
Dungeon Master 01:45:57 No offense, please go! You guys are kinda lingering. You're having weird side conversations at the edge of the room. I don't think you're actually sorry. What? You guys are so fuckin' odd. Uh, okay. See ya. Throws down her, like, welding mask. Starts going back at it.
Kaladin Shash 01:46:00 Right?
Zariel Torgan 01:46:04 Oh, I apologize, Ham Hawk. I thought that I could just leave a message with your assistant and that he would talk to you later. So it's fine. I'll see you later. So how much does an apprenticeship pay, Leo? You're getting paid, right?
Leopold Magnus 01:46:34 Well, Zariel, I think this one might be unpaid, but it's worth it. Hamhawk is quite something else when it comes to the, uh, Arnkane grafting. I'm very lucky to have gotten an apprenticeship with her. Well, see, you know, when you have family to support you, it makes it a little easier to go out, get a job, for free.
Zariel Torgan 01:46:44 After all that smack talk about me making less than a cook and you're working for free? I don't know. Leo, I think we need to seize the means of production.
Leopold Magnus 01:47:02 It's all about the experience, Zariel. It's worth the money. Hmm. Well, I did read that in one of my tomes once. It was quite an interesting take. All right, see you later. Let's go.
Zariel Torgan 01:47:18 Alright, alright we can talk about this more later. Let's go check that lady out.
Dungeon Master 01:47:30 OK, you guys head back. Pretty straight forward through the tunnel system. Eventually you find the area you left her and she's. Still there. Not not moving very still. Slow, steady chest falls. Ask on her face. Nothing's really changed. Yep, go for it.
Zariel Torgan 01:47:50 Can I do another fairy fire down here? Alright, I think we're safe to talk and I'll leave it up for as long as it's naturally up. I think it's a minute. Well,
Dungeon Master 01:48:00 She lights up, you guys light up, but nothing else lights up. Clear.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:20 What would we, what should we try?
Kaladin Shash 01:48:29 Do I feel anything being closer to the mast again or her?
Dungeon Master 01:48:34 Yeah, do you feel that same sort of pull?
Zariel Torgan 01:48:42 Well, since this morning, I practiced a new spell that I could try. I don't know if it'll be strong enough to have any effect on her, but I figure I could give it a try. What do you guys think? Alright, I'll reach down and I'll grab up a small
Kaladin Shash 01:49:02 Yes, please, by all means, try something.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:12 bit of dust. And I'll kind of spit in my palm and rub it together to create a little bit of a salve. And then I'll spread it out kind of like clay, making like a little snake out of the clay, because I'm not that creative. And then I'll just put it right on her forehead and press it in. So it's like a big old smudgy dirt thing. And when I touch her, I'll cast Lesser Restoration.
Dungeon Master 01:49:43 Okay, you invest all of this energy. And then like, how does your magic manifest again? Does it have like, if it's that iridescent, you see that sort of like, wave off of her like heat waves on the ground, but it's got that color to it, as it sort of like vibrates the air, and you eventually discharge the magic, and you don't see any change.
Zariel Torgan 01:50:08 Well, it was worth a try. I was a bit concerned it wouldn't be strong enough. I think I might not be up to the task. Did you guys have any thoughts or ideas?
Leopold Magnus 01:50:33 Oh, I don't have anything in particular, to be honest.
Kaladin Shash 01:50:34 If I touch the individual, do I feel anything? Okay, touch her.
Dungeon Master 01:50:47 Do you touch her? Yeah. Uh, Kaladin, you like grab her at the shoulder and you sort of just like are almost like outer body experience. You feel like you're pushed back out of yourself and into another memory you have of like a first person view, like sort of like,
Zariel Torgan 01:50:48 Ha ha ha ha! Oh!
Dungeon Master 01:51:17 sort of playful running through a field with this woman and she's got your hand in hers like behind her she's like jumping and laughing in front of you but there's no sound to it and the memory is almost like hazy and skewed a little bit but you see yourselves running through this field before it sort of like static interrupts and you pop back in just not totally sure what just happened
Dungeon Master 01:51:45 but then you feel just a connection to the mask the closer you get. You almost feel like you hear birds chirping in the background.
Kaladin Shash 01:51:58 I think I'd kind of look at my hand after kind of taking it off her shoulder and say, this is strange. I just had a vision of running through a field with this woman. Did I feel like I knew her or I was just seeing her from this perspective and she was holding the individual's hand? Okay. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:52:20 You were just looking through the perspective, but I don't think you know if it was anything more.
Kaladin Shash 01:52:31 I'm not positive who she is. Would I be able to roll any sort of check? Did the fields I was running in or the sky or everything in the vision look similar to the dome and the amber fields? Okay. These fields were not the amber fields, my friends.
Dungeon Master 01:52:53 No, it looks completely different.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:02 You think she's from somewhere else?
Kaladin Shash 01:53:02 I think we are learning. I think we're learning. Yes, I think we're learning more about something beyond the court. Beyond our dome. Yes, look at her. She was completely human.
Leopold Magnus 01:53:13 Hmm. It is indeed strange. Hamhawk has given us blueprints for a device to exit the dome. And you... Are you sure this girl is not from around here? Indeed.
Kaladin Shash 01:53:31 I'm telling you, what I saw was not the amber fields.
Leopold Magnus 01:53:40 These are some interesting puzzle pieces that we're starting to piece together.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:45 Jonathan, did you say that it was common knowledge that the world moved on without us and we were protected by this magic? That's like... Okay, okay, okay, alright. If we knew that... Okay, it doesn't matter. Anyway, okay. Are we thinking...
Dungeon Master 01:53:59 I did say that, but I didn't mean that. You guys wouldn't have known that.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:15 that this woman is being kept alive by this mask? And if we don't, are we willing to risk killing her to make some headway by ourselves? Because I don't think we've got another step by ourselves without bringing in the Legionnaires.
Kaladin Shash 01:54:45 I mean, she seems perfectly safe, very stable, perhaps just a little longer.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:51 Well, I guess my thought is that if we're ultimately going to attempt to take this thing off, regardless, one way or the other, we might as well do it now and see what happens. I mean, we could be back at the Corps or back at the Legionnaires, you know, quick as a whip if we absolutely had to.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:20 but if we're gonna try to handle this thing without them, I say we're here, unless there's something you'd like to bring to the table. But that's just me, I'm one of three.
Leopold Magnus 01:55:37 Azariel, I agree, I don't think we're well equipped to handle a situation like this.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:51 neutrally aligned so I'm cool to just wing some stuff.
Kaladin Shash 01:56:00 This is very difficult. I'd also want to know more, but I'm, I feel concerned if we take this off and it is a bad thing. But you're right. If she needs, if she needs help, we run her to the court.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:20 Well, my only thought is, you know... My only thought is, if we're gonna do it anyway, there's no sense in putting it off. If we aren't gonna try anything else, then... We could bring her in. We could bring her to the clerics and have them take a look.
Kaladin Shash 01:56:40 I know nothing else to try. We already know about that.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:50 but we'd have to be giving up. I mean, to be fair, they already know about her. So, I mean, what do we lose by bringing her in? We just keep that little extra piece of information and then we don't risk killing her. But hey, I'm a gambler. I mean, I got this cool ring by putting up
Zariel Torgan 01:57:15 seeing where things fall. But I'll go with whatever you guys think. I like the way you think. Leo, what do you think?
Kaladin Shash 01:57:24 I'm sure if we take the mask off, it's not irreversible. We can put it back on.
Leopold Magnus 01:57:34 Hmm. I'm not quite so sure. Um, and can I make an investigation into the tendrils, the tentacles of this? Are they, like, going down her throat and into her nose?
Dungeon Master 01:57:53 No, they don't quite spread into her nose and her mouth as close. You don't think so. But she does have flowers growing in her hair and popping out of underneath her sleeves in certain spots, very sparsely. But there is also plant growth on her herself. Like an atmosphere, it seems like, from the blants.
Leopold Magnus 01:58:11 And, uh, there's like a fog in the, the math that, that she's breathing. Right. Uh, so yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll turn to the guys and I'll say, well, it looks to me like she's breathing air that is not natural to this habitat. I don't know if it would be quite so wise to take that respirator off of her.
Kaladin Shash 01:58:22 Yeah. Very cool. I like this. Would I be able to do any sort of
Zariel Torgan 01:58:39 Come on, Rex, just let us kill this girl. I haven't got to wreck any major plot points for a DM in a while. What's the worst that could happen?
Leopold Magnus 01:58:48 Oh jesus Oh jesus
Kaladin Shash 01:58:49 I don't think I have that. I think I have detect magic. That's a little, a little three. Oh man. Would I be able to do like an Arcana or I guess even like a medical check or medicine check? Is she sleeping? Does it seem natural? Does it seem like magically induced?
Dungeon Master 01:59:01 That is hard to tell. You guys sort of already tried that before. She just seems like B is unconscious, but you're not sure of it.
Kaladin Shash 01:59:25 All right.
Dungeon Master 01:59:31 She's not like obviously snoring and you can tell she's breathing but it's very slow and paced like she's just not conscious.
Zariel Torgan 01:59:43 Can I reach out and I just want to... What would it be? I want to just like... I want to take a little part of the mask where it's touching the skin or by a strap or something and just poke my finger
Zariel Torgan 02:00:09 in a little bit and peel it back just enough like if you were wearing a scuba suit and you had a scuba mask on a little bit of air would pop out but the pressure from the pressurized system would refill it if if it was scuba obviously i'm not saying it is um that this is different um i just want to see if i can smell anything if i do that
Dungeon Master 02:00:24 Mm-hmm. Yeah. Go ahead and give me, we'll say like a sleight of hand check for how careful you can be. I'm at 12. You go to peel it off and the first thing you smell is like,
Zariel Torgan 02:00:41 Oh, I'm careful. Twelve.
Dungeon Master 02:00:53 fresh grass you smell like flowers faintly in the distance like lavenders and honeysuckles and and you get like just this like it smells like fresh air and like rain on the pavement after it rains but it's still wet like it's a very nature-based scent
Dungeon Master 02:01:13 But you're not as careful as you'd sort of hope to be. And the area that you lift up under the mask, the skin starts to blanch and lose color. And she goes like pale in that spot as it's like exposed to something other than something, right? Because you don't know.
Kaladin Shash 02:01:29 Hmm.
Zariel Torgan 02:01:32 interesting well I think and bear with me I think if we take this off it will kill her we may need to you don't have hands
Leopold Magnus 02:01:48 Oh, that's quite heavy indeed. I don't know if I want to have that on my hands. I look down, and I just stare off into the, there's nothing going on.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:02 What do you say, Kallen? You wanna...
Kaladin Shash 02:02:12 Yes, so what do we gain by... Perhaps she can let us know what is going on outside of the dome. Perhaps we'll find out how we can wake her up. I do... Yeah, I do not... Yes, no, we need to leave the mask on.
Dungeon Master 02:02:12 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:29 Bring her in. You want to take this mask off? I mean, she went all heebie-jeebies in the spot where this got in there. All right, you want to do some research? All right. All right.
Kaladin Shash 02:02:42 Perhaps we can find out a better way to awaken an individual that is in a state like this. Yes. A little more time. We have a couple of days off.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:59 I wanna cast Healing Word, try to heal that little spot. I know it's, I mean, out of character, I know it's not gonna work, but in character, I feel like I'd try it, see if it'd help. Oh, okay. Oh, well, we can just,
Dungeon Master 02:03:11 As soon as you put the mask back on, you see it actually sort of like the color flushed back into it and it seemed to recover pretty quickly. It wasn't like you were just holding it off for a while. So you don't need to end that slow-mo.
Kaladin Shash 02:03:24 We all clocked up? That did not wake her up though.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:27 We could just take the mask off and then ask her a few questions, put it back on. Oh, that's fair. All right. All right. We'll do some research. I just I'm a man of action. I like I like, you know, I get all excited to see things happen, but it's OK. Well, I'll get a shield and we'll get some supplies and it's OK. We'll get going.
Kaladin Shash 02:03:53 You stick to the blend. Before we leave, can I ritual cast alarm? Just so that we can. To the entrance of the tunnel, is it she already in a dead end? OK.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:57 All right. Ooh, smart.
Dungeon Master 02:04:05 Mm-hmm. Yeah, you've got her stashed in basically the equivalent of a broom closet, just a side door that stores stuff. Mm-hmm.
Kaladin Shash 02:04:23 Yeah, I would cast alarm so that we would just know if. The door swung open or someone walked in, or even if maybe you know if even if she woke up or moved, the alarm would at least trip. We could rush down there. I'm assuming will be within range. It's a mile. We have a mile.
Dungeon Master 02:04:45 uh it's it's much farther than that like this you gotta remember it's like a mega city it is enormous each district is basically like its own city it's like the scale we're talking here it's it's truly enormous um so you stashed your guys at like the the edge of the grove and dawn district like it's way out there which was the intent is to keep it separated so it'll it'll take like
Kaladin Shash 02:04:53 OK. So as we leave the core, I won't really be in range. OK. OK. No, so I won't. OK. OK.
Dungeon Master 02:05:11 an hour at least to get to like the tunnels to get a direct way back. Just sort of walk until you find a highway essentially.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:23 She definitely would have died by the time we got her back to the... Alright. I would agree. What other things are you after?
Kaladin Shash 02:05:26 Yeah, OK. Let us do the shopping. Is too bad we cannot get other things. I don't know. If we're going places where we can find some of these items, perhaps they have scroll or.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:56 Oh. Yeah. Mmm. That's how they get you with the itemized. Well, Leo, quit looking at your hands. I was, I was being, uh, I was being harsh. Come on over.
Kaladin Shash 02:05:56 items of interest that the Legionnaires could purchase for us, but it sounds like we must submit itemized to receipt.
Leopold Magnus 02:06:20 I slowly shift my gaze upward, but this whole time I've just been staring. I just kind of smash my hands into my visor, but there's, you know, there's no tears, of course. Oh, indeed. We have shopping.
Dungeon Master 02:06:21 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:06:27 Leo, I didn't know you could cry, you're weeping. All right, come on big guy, let's go.
Dungeon Master 02:06:50 Okay, do you guys head eventually to the market district? Yeah, as you make your way there, you know, it's a nice day. It's a little overcast, but it's warm. Little peaks of like artificial light that like sort of mimic the sun at the top of the dome shine down. And as you guys make your way to the market district, what are you looking for?
Zariel Torgan 02:06:58 Yeah, I figure that's where we're going, right?
Kaladin Shash 02:07:02 Yeah. Yeah, what's on the list? What's on our shopping?
Dungeon Master 02:07:20 What's the direction? You have gold. You need somebody who can cast a certain spell, diamond dust, and you have to stop by the library on the core. Dispel magic and anti-magic field, which is a hard one. That's a
Leopold Magnus 02:07:31 We did it, yeah. Good.
Kaladin Shash 02:07:33 We need diamond dust green. I don't think I have dispel. I think only have identify right now. Yeah, just identify. I think dispels a magic one, but. Or level one, but.
Zariel Torgan 02:07:41 What was the spells again? It was Dispel Magic and Anti-Magic Field. Yeah, I was gonna say. I don't have any of those.
Dungeon Master 02:07:49 It's a high level spell. Spell magic is level 3. Pretty sure.
Kaladin Shash 02:08:03 Don't have. Oh wow, dispels three. Nobody's got it. We gotta. Gotta pay someone to cast that. How do we collect that?
Zariel Torgan 02:08:12 No. Well, boys. We might need to just, like, kill more stuff. In order to do that. Because I have a feeling a third level scroll is going to be, like, really expensive. Oh wait, we're getting this paid for. Oh! Well heck yeah, let's find a magic shop.
Kaladin Shash 02:08:32 We, we, yeah, we're not, yeah, we're not paying for it. We're just shopping, man. We used to go shopping. That's why I was like, that's why I was like, man, man, we just got like a bulk purchase. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:08:43 Yeah, let's do it. You know what we should do? Whichever one of us, maybe I'll cast guidance or something, because I have guidance as a cantrip. We should try to be like, hey, we've got this open-ended checkbook, but who's to say we get all this stuff here? Maybe you throw a couple things on for free, we do our shopping at your place.
Kaladin Shash 02:09:11 We'll always come back here. I like where your head's at. Yeah. Oof. Zariel, you are very clever, my friend. I like the way you think.
Zariel Torgan 02:09:13 That way it's not on the itemized, you know, because, I mean, the money's getting spent, you know. It's not technically embezzling. Well, I know... Thank you, I know how to work around an expanse team. It's one of my many skills.
Zariel Torgan 02:09:40 Well, Leo, you're pretty familiar with the city and the layout. You wanna track us down a magic shop?
Leopold Magnus 02:09:50 Well, I don't don't suppose I know much about the city. I think you're more well-traveled than I am. But there was this one beautiful shop that we would go to every once in a while. It was quite nice, actually. Great selection out in the market now. Oh, I can't remember the district, but anyways.
Kaladin Shash 02:10:05 What was the name of the show? What was the name of the show? You're a child. You bought a bird. OK.
Zariel Torgan 02:10:15 I feel like... Leo, are you a child now?
Leopold Magnus 02:10:19 Oh, I can't remember. I was there once or twice with mother and father. Oh, yes, indeed. Well, I don't know. What are you trying to gather?
Kaladin Shash 02:10:40 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 02:10:45 Well, let me just put it to you this way. When you see a suit of armor made for a woman that's an adult, and it has the extra space for, like, uh, lady parts, does that make you feel any different than, uh, the guy suits of armor? Do you have a
Kaladin Shash 02:11:12 Preference.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:13 attraction or preference or any sort of Yeah
Leopold Magnus 02:11:18 Well, Zaria, I was mostly attending to my books. Quite frankly, my brother was always the one attracting the girls. Yes, you know, but that is quite a strange question. I don't know if I've ever been asked that, even by the doctors in the palace. They were never quite so invasive. They were just interested in my heart and my weight and, you know, all of the regular things.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:45 Hmm, what was your weight? Nine. That's, uh, I feel like you're always like two lines of dialogue away from like really important information.
Leopold Magnus 02:11:49 Well, I could hardly remember what I ate for breakfast. What do you think it was? I couldn't have been more than, I don't know, five or six feet tall.
Kaladin Shash 02:12:14 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:12:17 All right, we'll circle back. We'll circle back. Do any of us know the city? The market district or anything?
Dungeon Master 02:12:25 Caledon would probably have knowledge of the market district. Everybody's been there for like the most popular place to be. It's like where everybody buys everything.
Kaladin Shash 02:12:38 Would I know of a magic store that's like, maybe like the second or third largest, like put in the same area where we could acquire some of these items? Someone that might be more interested in making a deal for some business with the Legionnaires? Yeah, one history check coming up.
Dungeon Master 02:12:58 Yeah, you can there's a give me just we'll just do history check I guess Yeah, his characters trying to remember I guess
Zariel Torgan 02:13:10 gardens yeah does that work for out of game checks like things all right ouch
Kaladin Shash 02:13:15 The D4. OK. 12. That was a one on the D4.
Dungeon Master 02:13:30 Was that a $100 for them? Yes, it was. The only one, if you're like, there's the obvious choice, like the best, most extensive library shop everybody knows about, but then you're like, what's sort of an off-market one I can get that's going to be a little bit cheaper?
Dungeon Master 02:13:51 And the only one that really comes to mind is Feathered Quill, which is just like a scroll shop and like off of the side street, like not on the main strip.
Kaladin Shash 02:14:05 Gentlemen, let us go to this shop I know. Zariel, I think we might be able to implement your plan. I take us, I take us to this main area and then to the off-beaten, a little bit off-beaten path in the alley. The Feathered Quill, is that what you said? Feathered Quill?
Zariel Torgan 02:14:14 Fantastic. Lead the way.
Dungeon Master 02:14:32 Yeah, as you make your way down, it's not like an alley, it's not that bad. But there's like the obvious main strip that's got really well maintained bricks and sidewalks that are established and regular like lampposts that have arcane runes doing like the light cantrip, just like very well maintained and pleasant and like a side street that's just like more cobbled stone. And like it has more of like shops that are hole in the walls were just sort of like inset into buildings. They're not like super fancy presentation.
Kaladin Shash 02:14:45 Yep, yep.
Dungeon Master 02:15:00 One of them has a small sign draped over like the door. It's just got like a feathered fill. It doesn't even say feathered fill. It's just like people know that it's that's what it is. Just a bare sort of oak wood, just a natural brown tone. Nothing really ostentatious about it and like a window on the front. Looking in and you see like some scrolls on the wall, some pedestals that have books on them. Yeah, that's what you see.
Kaladin Shash 02:15:31 Yes, let us go in, this is it.
Dungeon Master 02:15:38 You step in and then like a little arcane rune over the doorway lights up with like a little baby blue and just goes. And you hear some dude from the back go, I'll be right with you. And popping out after, like from behind a shelf as like a pretty frail old man where his neck sort of hangs pretty detached on like his throat.
Zariel Torgan 02:15:39 All right.
Leopold Magnus 02:15:56 Thank you.
Kaladin Shash 02:16:05 Yes, hello, we are here shopping for some items that are required by
Dungeon Master 02:16:05 His eyes are kind of sunken and his hair is just like a flop of brown going to gray, pretty curly, but he's sort of squinting, even through his glasses. And he's got like a hunch just on the top of his shoulders. The rest of his back is pretty straight. And he sort of walks kind of funny into the front desk and he goes, well, how can I help you today? Well, I hope so.
Kaladin Shash 02:16:34 Yes, very good, sir, very good. But a certain individual, perhaps you know her, Hamhock? That's too bad, you're missing out. Anyway, we are needing certain items. Would you have
Dungeon Master 02:16:35 I got him again. I can't say I know her. I'll take your word for it. She sounds like a hoot. I'm sure.
Zariel Torgan 02:16:50 Okay.
Kaladin Shash 02:16:59 Would you have any or all of the items that we need on this list? If I could rattle off the items that we've been told a few times for the ability to do this.
Dungeon Master 02:17:10 he goes uh well hold on okay you need a hundred gold pieces of this and some diamond dust um well i can tell you for certain you're gonna have a hard time finding a scroll of anti-magic field let me tell you that's pretty hot magic you'd be better off finding somebody who could do it more than anything else and i'll give you that one for free next one i'll require a tip
Zariel Torgan 02:17:20 Hello, everyone.
Dungeon Master 02:17:40 uh as for the rest i could i could give you a cup i have a couple dispel magics in the back and i've got a i think i could probably scrap together that gold but i don't have any diamond dust that's not my uh not my specialty my name is nerman
Kaladin Shash 02:17:56 And then who do we have the pleasure of working with? Who are you? Sorry, come again? Glerman? Ne-erman! Yes, well said. It's a pleasure to meet you. Don't leave him hanging, but it's...
Dungeon Master 02:18:12 I thought my hearing was bad, this dude over here, right fellas? Takes his hand out for a high-five. Hell yeah. Come on over, man. I'm still here, I can't. Huh? What's that?
Zariel Torgan 02:18:20 I'll give him the five. Yeah, this guy can't hear shit. I said he can't hear. I said my friend can't hear.
Kaladin Shash 02:18:26 It's unenthusiastic. I said, I said.
Dungeon Master 02:18:43 Yeah, whatever. Bathroom in the back. That's what you're looking for. It's not well maintained. Yeah, give me an investigation check.
Zariel Torgan 02:18:49 Absolutely. I go to the bathroom because I feel too awkward. Oh no.
Leopold Magnus 02:18:56 Jonathan, can I take a look around this shop and see what else he's got, you know, hanging on the walls or anything catches my eye? Okay. Wow. Let's take one of the low rolls. Nine.
Kaladin Shash 02:18:57 Sure.
Dungeon Master 02:19:18 Uh you're just like not nothing is like catching your eye with a nine you're like maybe focusing on the wrong stuff it's sort of hard to tell it's like not a great one but you do see a couple things pop out to you uh he's got like five and scrolls aren't super common anymore either but it's like mostly for utility and enchanting um just because like
Dungeon Master 02:19:41 uh healing syringes are like pretty mainstream now where it's like a direct injection injection most more people can use them because you don't have to recite arcane spell components and you don't have to drink a potion it's just like instant uh so like healing spells have been mostly replaced by syringes but you do see he the students got like five old scroll of healing words they're listed for 50 gold a piece
Dungeon Master 02:20:11 he's got a couple scrolls of identify listed for a hundred gold a piece you see he's got a single scroll of shield for 50 gold and it's just like various things that like that that are like pretty low level spells you do see like he like he said he's got three dispel magics that are behind a glass case listed for each of them for 300 gold pieces each so they're in that not a whole lot
Kaladin Shash 02:20:36 And you can't see what those three are under the glass case. Just see if they're there.
Dungeon Master 02:20:44 They're scrolls of dispel magic. Nope, not really. This is like, again, not the high class place. Now you see some like books that are in season, you know, like he's also just like a book salesman. So you're finding scrolls in between just like
Leopold Magnus 02:20:48 There's nothing else in the case. Got it. Does he have any knickknacks, you know, like a couple of jacks? I don't know, like maybe some.
Dungeon Master 02:21:14 normal history books, some like arithmetic books. There's like a couple art books and some magazines, like just real basic stuff.
Leopold Magnus 02:21:24 OK. I guess I also had another question. As an artificer, if I have a scroll, can I learn the spell? Or is that like a wizard thing?
Kaladin Shash 02:21:31 Um, kind of wish these little walkie talkies in our uniform were like just like loud. We need stealth comms.
Dungeon Master 02:21:51 That I know for sure is a wizard thing. You'd have to check about it in like your spell section because I'm not too sure. I think that might just be a thing because they've got their tome tradition.
Kaladin Shash 02:22:00 Alright. I'll take. I'll be under like it could be a. Probably in your seats and. Well, no. Let's just say yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:22:05 That's in the description of the character. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:25 It's a classability thing. Should we? Oh, go ahead. Yes. Are we?
Kaladin Shash 02:22:30 Um, Zaria, Zaria, do you want to try to bribe or work less than bribing? You want to see if we can come to an arrangement here or perhaps a better trump?
Dungeon Master 02:22:50 Rex, to answer your question, only wizards can do that, but you only need one level of wizard to be able to do that. So, like, if it's something you wanted to be able to do ability-wise, you just have to take, like, a wizard level or something like that. But otherwise, only wizards can copy spells.
Leopold Magnus 02:22:55 Got it
Zariel Torgan 02:23:10 Um, yeah, I think this is the perfect, oh, yeah, uh, yeah, I think, uh, I think this is the perfect place to try that out. I think we say, you know, we know, hey, we could go to the place we know has everything we need, but we're going here because we think we can make something work. See, I'll have him throw a kick in something. Doesn't have to be crazy, but I'll tell you what, I'm gonna reach out and I'm just gonna,
Kaladin Shash 02:23:20 It feels right, right?
Zariel Torgan 02:23:40 touch like the, I know the lower part is the small of the back, is the upper part like the big of the back? What's that called? I don't wanna, yeah. I'm gonna grab the big of his back and I'm just gonna, you're gonna feel a little pulse. And it's, I'm just gonna guide him towards his,
Leopold Magnus 02:23:47 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:23:50 Yeah, I guess. Shoulders.
Kaladin Shash 02:23:52 You can call it the big of the day. Yeah. Oh, gosh, no.
Zariel Torgan 02:24:08 charismatic ventures and then I'll also stand and I'll be part of it. So I'll jump in when it feels necessary because I want to aid in whatever's about to happen.
Kaladin Shash 02:24:25 I'll be honest, the guy's name's already escaped me again. I already know it starts with an N, that's it. Nerman, Herman the Nerman. Nerman, we have a question for you. Nerman, yes. Okay, I know you hear very well. Look, look at me.
Dungeon Master 02:24:30 Nerman. Huh? Yeah, what? I heard you. Perfect. Nobody here better than I do. I'm trying. You're so far away.
Leopold Magnus 02:24:31 Lerman
Zariel Torgan 02:24:46 Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:24:55 We have an open account. Yes, focus. We have an open account right now. Perhaps we can come to some arrangement in that we come to your store frequently for the supplies that are required under this open account. And in doing so, perhaps you give us a few extra items as a thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:25:22 I mean, I'm real sorry, fellas. I don't really have a whole lot here. I guess you could take some of those scrolls. I get all this stuff secondhand anyway. I don't know how to do any arcane stuff, if I'm being totally honest. I'm just saying it's min by trade. If you want better deals and stuff like that, just hit anywhere on the strip, really.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:23 I'll see.
Kaladin Shash 02:25:39 That was the worst. Can I insight check? Is he really just not know anything? He's just fumbling through this ownership?
Dungeon Master 02:25:51 I think what I bring to the table is charm. If you'd like look left and right this is a pretty like you sought out the like third or fourth tier brawl shop. But that also in turn means that he doesn't have like huge inventory.
Dungeon Master 02:26:14 And he probably doesn't get as many customers because people just go to like the Walmart equivalent where they can just get things in bulk and maybe cheaper, things like that.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:25 I think we may have aimed too low. Let's go for like second. Let's go for like the target version. Yes.
Kaladin Shash 02:26:28 I think second tier. Let's go for second tier. OK. OK. Norman. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:26:36 Why, Norman, it was a pleasure doing business with you, but unfortunately you don't have any of those knickknacks I was looking for.
Dungeon Master 02:26:44 I've got your stuff right here. You see he's like bundling everything up. He's like, you made a good choice shopping with Nerman though. I'll hook you up. Next time you're in, I'll get you like a sandwich. How's that sound? Poor soul.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:58 He doesn't eat, and then I'll walk out. Maybe we can try a bit higher up. All right. Lead the way.
Kaladin Shash 02:27:02 Peace. Second tier. Let us go back to the main street. I know a place that's not quite as nice, but you know.
Leopold Magnus 02:27:19 Bye.
Kaladin Shash 02:27:29 Where does my Rolodex take us?
Dungeon Master 02:27:30 Yeah, you make your way. Yeah, down the main strip just off of memory you find some stuff here in the past, running errands or whatever you were doing at the time for work or research.
Dungeon Master 02:27:43 it's called mystical scripts scroll it is a nice building sort of nestled in between other buildings doesn't seem like it's going to be pretty big until you walk in um it's got an intricately carved wooden sign that depicts a scroll that kind of glows softly um the entrance is framed by like fake stone pillars giving it like the appearance of grandeur but it's like
Dungeon Master 02:28:11 wood carved to look like stone it's like not totally right. And then the wall itself is a very nice like mahogany rich sort of deep red color as you open in inside the shop is a cozy space but that also is very large like it almost feels magical walking in.
Dungeon Master 02:28:30 It's filled to the brim with scrolls of all sizes. They're all very meticulously organized. Glass display cases cover everything, and there's no obvious gaps in them. It seems like they're sealed behind. It's got little neat price points for everything listed out.
Kaladin Shash 02:28:37 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:28:49 And there's like a woman working with some customers, just like speaking to them, you know, casual hand gestures, pointing to things and having a conversation. Seems like they strike a deal and she like shakes their hand and gives them a pat on the shoulder at the same time and then like moves forward and makes eye contact with you. And she goes, wait, hello, how can I help you?
Kaladin Shash 02:29:14 Hello, ma'am. We're here to acquire some items that we are needing for a project. Perhaps you can assist? I repeat the list again.
Dungeon Master 02:29:23 and interesting. I absolutely can. I have, you see, most things. And she sort of raises her eyebrows. I am quite talented that way. But anyway, enough about me. What is it you were looking for? She goes, oh, okay. I've got
Kaladin Shash 02:29:47 I believe the quantities are written on the sheet, are they not?
Dungeon Master 02:29:50 The Dispel Magics are on sale for $2.50 right now. I can get you probably more than enough, certainly, than you're requiring. What sort of project is this? What is the timeline? How many casts do you need of each thing? Okay, so we're looking for... You show her and she goes, oh, I've seen this work before. Are you on business of the Corps?
Kaladin Shash 02:30:21 Yes, we are. We have an account for you to build, and we need these items relatively quickly for FemHawk.
Dungeon Master 02:30:23 Oh, that's perfectly fine then. All right, then I'll, I'll get my guys to deliver it. Uh, thanks for the notice. Uh, I will say I don't have diamond dust here. That's a sort of a, you could buy diamonds, I suppose, and grind them up, but
Zariel Torgan 02:30:30 you
Dungeon Master 02:30:48 I specialize more in the scrolls and the books of it, you know, the real meat and potatoes of the magic arts. With that statement, you kind of figure it's a regular service. You get insight check if you want, but like at presentation, it seems pretty standard reaction to seeing that.
Kaladin Shash 02:30:53 Did we understand Hamhawk wanted us to bring the items back or would we understand that this is a regular service? OK.
Zariel Torgan 02:31:21 I'm going to grab the medium of his back and just give him a little nod, like if we want to try our play here.
Kaladin Shash 02:31:36 And what was your name ma'am? Your reputation precedes you. I have a question for you ma'am.
Dungeon Master 02:31:39 Oh, thanks for asking. I thought you never would. My name is Philindra, Philindra Sprawlweaver. Perhaps you've heard of me. I do appreciate your candor. Listening.
Kaladin Shash 02:32:05 Me and my colleagues here are part of an elite training group. We will regularly be making these trips for the shopping. Perhaps if we guarantee we will always come here for the shopping, you could sweeten the list a little for us?
Dungeon Master 02:32:25 You devil. Go ahead and give me a persuasion check. Did you get guidance? Or are you trying to help them with an assist? Do you get one or the other? Yeah. I mean, they're doing their thing.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:34 So I guided him, but I was also going to hop in, but he's doing such a good job that I was going to add, I don't know. Was there a natural point for me to say something, or is this kind of like the two of them doing their thing? Well, I just wanted to add, because it seems like she's being receptive, I could say, well, and we could also
Dungeon Master 02:32:52 If you want to interject at some point and be part of the conversation, go for it.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:04 promote your shop and your goods and services when the good civilians ask us about who equips us. We could send them your way, give you a bit of free advertising, as it were. And I was just hoping I might be able to, like, give him some... I don't want to make a check, but I was hoping I could help give him an advantage or something.
Kaladin Shash 02:33:04 Terrible.
Dungeon Master 02:33:23 Interesting. Yeah, you can roll it again with advantage. Or sorry, not d11, but roll it again. Yeah. Yeah, you get advantage, so it's whatever the highest roll is plus the d4, so you get a three on whatever you roll.
Kaladin Shash 02:33:34 All right, sweet. Just one more roll, y'all. Do you want me to keep the D4, roll the D4 again? All right, so it's three. That's great. OK. 19, 19.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:40 All right 19.
Dungeon Master 02:33:55 Much better. Here goes, I like, I like the idea. I'm famous and all, but it's always been my dream to be more famous. I think this is a cute little encounter of yours. Uh, here's what we'll do. Uh, you come in on business and the larger the order from Ham Hock, I will give you each a, we'll say uncommon class of squirrel of your choice.
Kaladin Shash 02:34:07 Excellent. How did we do today?
Zariel Torgan 02:34:08 You can always be more.
Dungeon Master 02:34:32 Well, with this... It's not a huge list. The Dispel Magic is honestly going to be the largest. Here's what I can do. I will give you... Either you can have a Scroll of Shield or a Scroll of Magic Missile.
Kaladin Shash 02:34:49 Boom, boom.
Dungeon Master 02:35:01 I'll give you one of each of those and then you can have one. What do I have a lot of right now? And you see she like holds up her wrist and like she's like scrolling through an inventory. She has like her tome presents is like a wristband almost. It's so small and like it's been cast like reduced size and everything like it's just like all very small and neat. Just scrolling through her inventory and she goes. I seem to have a little bit surplus I've got.
Dungeon Master 02:35:30 You can have either, we'll say, a scroll of fireball or a scroll of fly. Right back at you. He saw a fly. He's like, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:35:37 Oh my god. I look at Zariel and Leo and say, I wouldn't mind having that. Oh god, what's my British accent? God. He was Russian. Yeah. I wouldn't mind having the fighter ball. I could do quite a bit of that with our group. Perhaps you guys could split the other one?
Zariel Torgan 02:35:56 Honestly, I'd say just whatever you want on both. Those are both one time use things for me, whereas you'd get a bit more out of it, so I'd leave it up to you. Oh.
Kaladin Shash 02:36:16 Why no magic missiles and a no shield So if that's if that's helpful for either of you guys that's like a one-off
Zariel Torgan 02:36:30 Well, what do you say, Leo? You got a preference? What was that? I think your visor is shut on your face. It's making your voice very muffled. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:36:50 Making it real soft. We got a scroll of fireball fireball and a scroll of magic missile.
Leopold Magnus 02:36:53 Do you hear the visor open up? I mean, I guess it doesn't open, but you just kind of like hear a little slot, a little slot move. Why, yes, I think the missiles would be a fine addition to my suit of protection.
Zariel Torgan 02:37:10 All right, you heard the thing. Oh, we get both? Oh, then I'll take the shield then if we each get to choose. All right.
Dungeon Master 02:37:18 Scroll of fireball. And then do you guys each want to scroll of magic missile then? Yeah, you each get one of those and then one like bigger item, which was the fireball. Yep. Alrighty.
Zariel Torgan 02:37:43 Do you have any business cards or stickers or things we can hand out? Is there a tagline you'd like us to say? Like, don't worry about the moles. Come here to get your scrolls.
Leopold Magnus 02:37:58 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 02:38:00 That's very cute, but when you failed to specify the first time, you see she like pushes her glasses a little bit higher on the bridge of her nose. She goes, I capitalized. She pulls out her wand and on like an empty space on your armor plating, you see she like arcane imprints a picture of her face with the name of the shop underneath it. She goes, that'll do nicely.
Kaladin Shash 02:38:25 Totally.
Zariel Torgan 02:38:30 Yeah. I think there. I'm sure that won't conflict with any Legionnaire code or anything. I'm sure that will be fine. Thank you, ma'am. And then.
Dungeon Master 02:38:35 You look gorgeous. Um, but, uh, for sure. And then, uh, talk to Lonnie, my assistant, and he'll get you the gold. I do have that in stock, but yeah, sorry. You might have to find a,
Leopold Magnus 02:38:59 All right.
Kaladin Shash 02:39:00 This was a pleasure. I'm sure I'll be seeing you again.
Dungeon Master 02:39:01 I don't know, normally the traveling merchants between the districts tend to have the more spell component type deals. She like winks and hip chucks, she says, you know it, you have to come back now.
Zariel Torgan 02:39:12 All right, well, thank you, ma'am. I think we'll be finding our way. Going to give Kaladin the dancing eyebrows, like, hey, hey.
Kaladin Shash 02:39:32 Back. Ooh.
Dungeon Master 02:39:35 And you From the way you understand it you have
Zariel Torgan 02:39:44 All right. So this armor's got me all worried that they're always watching us. I want to do some shady stuff, but I don't know if we should. All right.
Dungeon Master 02:40:05 like there's enchantment in the armor that tracks just like if you've if you're dying or not and because you guys triggered it twice and then it turned off they cast like the scry on your armor to get like an instant success to see what's happening they were going to like assess the situation but you don't like you don't know that they can like listen or anything like that at all times they're not like you know you can keep checking for a fairy fire but you don't know
Kaladin Shash 02:40:13 You know.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:26 Alright guys, I have an idea. Now it is technically stealing or embezzling or whatever you want to call it. So everybody's pushing us to go to some traveling merchant to get this diamond dust.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:56 Who's to say that they don't say the diamond dust costs double and we split the difference? Are you guys comfortable with that or should we just stay on the straight and narrow and be happy we got the scrolls?
Kaladin Shash 02:40:56 All of it.
Leopold Magnus 02:41:16 Well, why, Zario, that's quite the interesting proposition, to be honest with you. I don't know if I would have thought it myself, but if you think it's a good idea...
Zariel Torgan 02:41:32 Well, I don't want to corrupt your sense of honor and duty, but it just, it occurs to me that a big conglomerate can afford to shell out a little bit here and there. Call it breakage. But I'm up for, you know, either way, maybe we play it straight. You know, we're still pretty new.
Kaladin Shash 02:41:33 Bye.
Kaladin Shash 02:42:06 Perhaps whenever we need to buy more than just 100 gold worth of, is it just 100 gold worth of diamond dust is what we're at in the casting? Oh, it's a ton. Yeah, I thought it was 100. And then just the casting of the anti-magic, what are we doing?
Dungeon Master 02:42:15 Uh, I believe it's 500. Oh no, it is 100, you're right. It actually seems like, um... Belindra said that she could take care of everything but the Diamond Elf.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:36 I think that, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:42:43 But the diamond. Okay, so she had the harder scroll too, awesome. Zaryel, if you feel like we can get more gold, I guess, but perhaps we're just starting. We'll do another job.
Zariel Torgan 02:43:06 I think you're right. I think I'm getting too greedy. Let's just get this handled and then we'll make money the right way. Well.
Kaladin Shash 02:43:18 OK. We'll go to the merchants that tend to deal with these items. Good.
Dungeon Master 02:43:26 Okay. Uh, you can sort of, yeah, we can sort of speed along real quick just to get some more, some more fun stuff. But you guys, you find just like a stall and you see like the guys got like diamonds on display. Uh, his little shop is called curious and wonders. And there's some stuff there if you were trying to like look for anything fun,
Dungeon Master 02:43:50 But like in general, he's like, Oh yeah, I can charge you a hundred gold pieces for a hundred gold pieces worth of diamonds with a fee to dust them. Or he he'll sell you a jeweler's kit for 10 extra gold and you can do it yourself. And then she do, you wouldn't have to buy it. You also know as a tinkerer,
Leopold Magnus 02:44:11 I think I had a jeweler's kit in inventory. I don't remember. Right. Yeah, that's that's part of my class abilities. I don't know if I.
Dungeon Master 02:44:20 I'm pretty sure even at your level already, you can create tinkering gear, can't you? He just looks at it and goes, no, actually, this blueprint's pretty cool.
Kaladin Shash 02:44:29 Excellent, can you also create a receipt? Will this. You can just charge it. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:44:33 Ha ha ha ha ha!
Leopold Magnus 02:44:37 I'll also Leopold's Magnificent Jewels.
Dungeon Master 02:44:42 you can just charge like it sends a message to the core and they'll they'll send out somebody to pay me it's just like it's right here and he shows you like basically the equivalent of like an arcane qr code like it's a certain rune that lights up like as part of the transaction like it just knows and he's like i've seen this before they've come for diamond dust in the past you can uh you just it'll it'll get taken care of
Kaladin Shash 02:45:01 Yep. Do you guys want to shop for something?
Dungeon Master 02:45:16 Well, anyway, you want to buy my other shit? I got the coolest ring you've ever seen. If you want to stay warm in the cold, I've got you. Also, I've got this necklace that whispers when you whisper into it.
Zariel Torgan 02:45:23 What other stuff you got? What does it say?
Kaladin Shash 02:45:44 What? You've never used it? You've never used it?
Dungeon Master 02:45:47 Well, I don't actually know. I bought it from a guy who knew a dude so like, I'm just telling you what he said. And I was just a business man. No, it's not you. I don't want to be used goods. No. Trust me, it works. You could,
Zariel Torgan 02:45:54 Can I try it on? Well, how do I know what it does or how it works?
Dungeon Master 02:46:17 I don't know if you if you guys got that one spell that lets you identify things whatever that one's called you could use it from afar but like I'm not just gonna let you use it you might run off I don't know you
Zariel Torgan 02:46:28 Look at this seal. It says Legionnaire. And look at this defacing of my armor. It's got a woman's face on it with her shop. I've got multiple representatives saying that I am upstanding. Not gonna run off. Give me that necklace.
Dungeon Master 02:46:48 Um, okay. He's like, Oh Jesus, fuck dude. Fine. It doesn't seem to work right away. I've, I've like, I'll admit I've put it on before, but usually it takes like something like, I don't know, it feels like longer than a couple minutes to make it work. If it does work, you stand outside of a stealth for 30 minutes as you attune to try to use it. Uh,
Zariel Torgan 02:47:08 I'm a patient man. Heck yeah! I just, once I feel like I've got a bit for it, you know, I feel how it goes, I'll just be like,
Dungeon Master 02:47:18 And you feel like you could probably do what he says, like maybe you could communicate with somebody. Do you try it? What do you do? No response.
Kaladin Shash 02:47:30 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:47:39 Is there anybody in this necklace? Knock, knock. I have important information on your car's warranty.
Dungeon Master 02:48:04 You're not getting anything with what you're currently doing. Why didn't he try to communicate with his friends?
Kaladin Shash 02:48:05 You.
Zariel Torgan 02:48:11 Hmm. Well, I guess maybe it doesn't work. I was hoping I could use this to communicate with my friends and, you know, work better to help make the Corps a safer place, but... Huh? Oh, uh...
Dungeon Master 02:48:37 dm to player jesse why didn't why didn't he try to communicate with his friends that that's what he wanted it for
Zariel Torgan 02:48:45 I didn't know there was such a thing that you didn't have to have somebody else having a counterpart item. So, let's see. I'll put my hands and my fingertips on my temple and I'll just think to myself, I want to talk to the chick that's unconscious.
Kaladin Shash 02:48:52 Put some intention in there.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:14 And I'll say, can you hear me, unconscious lady? What about Leo? Leo, can you hear? I'm saying this out loud, too. Can you hear me?
Dungeon Master 02:49:21 Nothing seems to happen. Leo with like. Yeah, both audibly and like telepathic delay. You hear that statement come through in your brain too.
Leopold Magnus 02:49:33 Why, yes, Zario, my ears are working quite fine. I just kind of like smack my helmet a little bit and I say, I think there's something wrong with my reception. My ear transmitters are, it's an echo. I don't know what's up with that.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:45 Oh yeah. Does any of what he says come back to me, or is it just a one-way seemingly?
Kaladin Shash 02:49:56 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:50:12 No, it doesn't say. So I'm going to say because it doesn't specify it one way. Call it cool 500.
Zariel Torgan 02:50:18 I imagine it's interesting. How much are you asking for this necklace? Well, I've seen lots of these and I'll take it off and I'll hand it back. 500 is way too much. Let's go, guys.
Kaladin Shash 02:50:39 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 02:50:47 You come back when you want the, you don't want the ring though, I promise it's pretty cool. This year, and I can tell you it works for sure, because I've worn this one. It's a ring of warmth. It protects you from the stream, extreme cold and cold stuff.
Zariel Torgan 02:50:54 All right, what's it do? How much would you like for your heating ring?
Dungeon Master 02:51:16 Pretty cool, huh? Call it a hundred gold. How about that?
Zariel Torgan 02:51:27 Well, you guys want to pool some money and get a heating ring or you want to keep looking?
Kaladin Shash 02:51:41 I mean, above table, I don't know what we're going to encounter. It might be helpful. We don't know what the environment is going to be like out there. I'll give you the 38 colds you need to get there. OK.
Leopold Magnus 02:51:54 Yeah, if you're looking to buy something, I'll pitch in. It could come in handy.
Dungeon Master 02:51:59 Uh, Kaladin, give me an insight check. Oh, we'll help him out here. Uh, this dude's way overcharging for this.
Kaladin Shash 02:52:12 23. I think I would just step in and say, friend, why are you asking so much money for such a common item?
Zariel Torgan 02:52:14 Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:52:29 For this, this is a high-quality, uh, uh, uh, Enduvian steel, though. Like, this is the real deal. Like, probably like half of that, yeah. It's a ring that grants cold resistance, and that's it. So it's, it's not...
Kaladin Shash 02:52:43 Having rolled that 24, would I understand the item? Like, would I understand what its value should be? Is he, like, doubling what we should be paying? 50 gold. Yeah. Right. Yes.
Dungeon Master 02:52:59 Like a high magic item. Yes. I'll keep it warm for you is what he says as you walk away. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:53:01 Is it attunement? Okay, alright. Alright, let's get out of here. Let's get out of here. Let's find some cool stuff. Yeah we've got everything we need.
Kaladin Shash 02:53:13 We will shop where they are friendly. Yes. Alright, so now we've got the diamond dust. Alright, off to Ham Hock.
Dungeon Master 02:53:28 You got everything you need. Yeah, a standard shield is 10 gold.
Zariel Torgan 02:53:31 Oh, let's stop and get a, just real quick, let's stop and get a simple shield. We don't need to do the whole banter part. I'll just get a cheap, whatever it costs to get a cheap shield. All right. Sounds good. We'll mark it off.
Dungeon Master 02:53:58 Okay, what's the plan, guys? I imagine you go back to Hamhawk and you drop that stuff off. This is still sort of your downtime. I know at least one of you wanted to go to the libraries. That's still the case.
Kaladin Shash 02:54:04 Present the items. Yeah, I was hoping. In the library to possibly find some low end. Common knowledge scrolls that would just be written down somewhere.
Leopold Magnus 02:54:24 I might tuck in with Ham Hawk and spend a bit of time as her apprentice putting this together and hoping to learn some skills.
Dungeon Master 02:54:36 Yeah. As you work with Hamhawk, Hamhawk has you cast the spell a bunch as she like preps it and does these things and she explains to you like the process. Go ahead and just give me a general luck check, so just a d20 roll to see like how much you just kind of gain in knowledge of just like what this is from conversation and then natural 20.
Leopold Magnus 02:54:59 Oh, baby. Natural 20.
Dungeon Master 02:55:05 You're just like sitting there, Hymhok is like welding in certain spots and casting into other and she like has it held steady as you sort of just do multiple dispel magic enchants into like the arcane scribing. And then she, as she's just talking as she happens, she goes, oh yeah, so the really cool thing about this is that like,
Dungeon Master 02:55:32 The plan for it that overall I'm really excited about so like the way by the brain works that I'm sort of putting into this is a controlled opening for the door right do something that has never been done before.
Dungeon Master 02:55:49 I heard from just down the pipeline that Lord Marshal Thyr is trying to send out a squad of Omen Knights to get back in touch with Moonhaven, because it only went dark a couple weeks ago and nobody's really sure why. So, like, it's going to be this big festival that's held in a couple days. They're about to announce it. So this is going to be like, what we unraveled will be like a send-off party.
Leopold Magnus 02:56:15 Oh, my, that's quite interesting, Hamhawk. Well, as your apprentice, how may I be of service? Oh, of course, of course, as you insisted. What can I do for you today? I've really enjoyed learning and spending time here watching you craft this magnificent piece.
Dungeon Master 02:56:22 Cool. Not my apprentice. Does Leopold want it badly enough to push himself to learn the spell as he's like casting it over and over again? Like would he
Kaladin Shash 02:56:26 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:56:52 sacrifice something to get that knowledge? Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:56:57 No, I think that he's probably just trying to practice and, you know, practice comes skill. He's really invested in learning, so kind of short-cutting that process doesn't really compute.
Dungeon Master 02:57:15 Yeah, you think if you worked with Hamhawk for maybe like a couple more projects or something like that, like you could definitely start to get a little more advanced in your tinkering and setups and you can improve on some stuff. But like for now, it's just basic training. Reciting spells is sort of good practice for you. Seeing how she does it like very intricately and she creates hammers that can inscribe runes to cast stuff into. So you're like learning the steps of how to artifice at this point.
Dungeon Master 02:57:46 And it's just like a nice conversation as she like puts together, it's like almost like a prism type shape as it's like finally coming together. And eventually she, you and her both finish it together and she's like, all right, the last thing this needs is the special binding spell from the binder at the library. You said you'd manage that for me too, right? I don't have to do that.
Leopold Magnus 02:57:46 Cool.
Leopold Magnus 02:58:13 Well, as a good apprentice, of course I'll take care of it for you. Indeed.
Dungeon Master 02:58:20 Lovely. You know, do it whenever, but I'm pretty sure the festival's gonna be in the next couple days, like I think two, if I'm being totally honest. So the quicker, the better. Sweet. See ya.
Kaladin Shash 02:58:43 It's true.
Leopold Magnus 02:58:51 All right, jet off to the library then.
Dungeon Master 02:58:54 Beautiful. Anything else anybody else wants to do? We got one library trip.
Zariel Torgan 02:59:09 I might just try to familiarize myself a little bit more with the market district, maybe spend a day or two just getting a mental layout of where all the shops are and where the specialty places are. That way I can be a little more helpful when we're, you know, trying to find something or look around in the area.
Dungeon Master 02:59:29 Yeah, easy enough. I'll say if you're ever needing to navigate the market district quickly for something, you'll be able to do it much faster. Otherwise, you guys make it to the market district. Sorry, not the market district. You were just there. The library. It's in the core, and you would previously major
Zariel Torgan 02:59:41 All right
Dungeon Master 03:00:00 Way there before, down a couple hallways, down some stairs, up another set of stairs, like it just takes a little bit to get there, but eventually you find the doors that were sealed prior, but as you walk up, some like invisible runes on your armor that you normally can't see sort of just flash for a second, and the seal on the door goes green as it opens back up, and you enter into this huge room. Truly just gorgeous in appearance.
Dungeon Master 03:00:28 uh what you see um
Dungeon Master 03:00:32 It is like a large cavernous space. It's got rows and rows of towering bookshelves, each packed with tome scrolls and then like more modern leather-bound books. There's dark polished wood shelves and then like a mix of a little more like modern technology. Like there you have a mirror finish like wall set in with arcane runes around it and you see like
Dungeon Master 03:00:59 some mages and arcanists who are like manipulating runes on the side and it like brings up different pictures they have embedded into like memory cells that they can bring up like a database they can access uh just like scattered throughout here um and it's like that's amidst all of the books and everything
Dungeon Master 03:01:22 And that's sort of what you have in, we'll say the two of you, because one of you is sort of just sort of hanging around the market district at this point.
Kaladin Shash 03:01:37 Would I be able to move around? Can we move around freely within it, or does it feel like there are restricted areas, or are we being watched by, you know, attendants or a librarian?
Dungeon Master 03:01:49 You are like people take notice of you like the different bribes and like mages doing their various work and like the librarians doing various organizing all like notice you but like nobody pays much of mind at like this main level but you do see like there's a staircase that goes up to like different levels and you don't really know how it is on those ones. You do see like a set of doors but like above the doors it says just like headmaster's office like it just seems like
Dungeon Master 03:02:18 There's no, like, secret things that you can see at least. Like, what do you support specifically?
Kaladin Shash 03:02:22 OK. Uhm, would I be able to look like in a self index or? Area of the library to find out like are there partitioned areas? Are there scrolls? That we can view. Uhm, specifically.
Kaladin Shash 03:02:45 Level a level to scroll that I want to eventually be able to write down into my wizard book. I may be interested in. Trying to slight of hand it out. So I don't have time because I won't have the gold of the time to write it down right now. Uhm? I. I was going to be looking for scatter.
Dungeon Master 03:03:00 What spell? Yeah, go ahead and give me an investigation check.
Kaladin Shash 03:03:27 Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:03:29 14. 14 is, you know, not bad, but not great. You're searching through, you find like an evocation section of scrolls. But what you notice right away is like a lot of the scrolls seem like chained to like their casings and stuff so that for the reason that people can't just steal them. So you find the scroll attached to it.
Dungeon Master 03:03:54 But like the role wasn't so bad that like somebody is like what is he doing with that or anything like you haven't been taking notice looking at this scroll in particular. At least for the spells themselves it seems like a lot of the scrolls that are just informational or history texts are just like normal scrolls.
Kaladin Shash 03:04:05 OK, so they're really set up for anti-theft. That's cool. Would I be able to find anything on? Obviously, there's censorship. You're not just going to be able to read
Leopold Magnus 03:04:24 Yep.
Kaladin Shash 03:04:34 if they're already knowing of extra dome activity or individuals. Would I be able to read any sort of history on like the Feywild? Would there be anything like that? Yeah, I'll just ask for help. That feels like a much more common
Dungeon Master 03:04:51 Yeah, go ahead and give me either you can ask for help or you can look after it like yourself. Yeah, you you're like in gear obviously. So like some people see you there are like other soldiers in here doing step two and eventually you get pointed to who you're told is the head librarian who sort of has like the catalog of all this in his head.
Kaladin Shash 03:05:04 request for more literature.
Dungeon Master 03:05:20 He's an elderly gentleman. He goes by the title of Grand Historian Garris. He smells of dust, paper, and like pencil shavings. Like just a very familiar smell of just like book work. His eyes are sunken in. His hair is absent on the top of his head, but it puffs out on the sides and is accompanied by thick white eyebrows that nearly connect to the hair on the sides.
Dungeon Master 03:05:50 He has a large bulbous nose and he sort of carries a constant face of annoyance. And he goes, it is my understanding that you have requested me. A topic I'm well familiar with.
Kaladin Shash 03:06:04 Yes, I would like to know if I can read anything about the Feywilds.
Dungeon Master 03:06:18 as head bookkeeper. Yeah, so with you inquiring about this specifically, I've got the era of when I was free. There's a section on level two covering when there were planar bindings on the Feywild. There's some texts on that, pretty interesting stuff. There's not been much contact since then.
Dungeon Master 03:06:45 and nothing we can do from in here at least so it dies off after that but there's some sparse stuff yeah you read about uh it was
Kaladin Shash 03:06:53 Yeah, can I check out the second scroll that he mentioned with the interactions or the cropping over?
Dungeon Master 03:07:07 knowledge at the time, and this was communicated to the Anduvan people, which is like your overarching race species, that Jaya, who was the elder god of nature and life and creation, was hiding in the Feywild for much of the war. And because of that, access to the Feywild was sealed away,
Dungeon Master 03:07:32 But at some point, something happened which, like, opened the floodgates and she was able to, like, escape the Feywild. And so that was, like, during the ascension of the Hero's Era. And so, like, before that, while she was hiding, there was zero access to the Feywild. There was zero planar travel. And so there was what was called a planar binding. But there's not a whole lot of information about what it was or why it changed. That's, like, not...
Dungeon Master 03:08:01 Not common knowledge. You could try. No.
Kaladin Shash 03:08:14 Okay, cool cool Yeah, I was really hoping that was gonna be an opportunity to try to take some of this stuff but it makes sense security I Mean I don't have tools for theft and I don't even know if I have a dagger to like try to cut something My inventory is very limited
Dungeon Master 03:08:38 I think everybody gets a dagger so you would have that and you also do know from like intermittently watching Leopold over the past few days he has like new skills he's been learning where he has the ability to like called like right tool for the job or he can basically create anything with enough time that he needs so if you want to like cue him in on this you can you don't know how he'll take it obviously but you do have options if you wanted to take stuff.
Dungeon Master 03:09:05 Otherwise, it might be like a comeback later in Toronto kind of deal. I mean, yeah, it's like getting to be evening, but it's just a later day at this point. So like everybody's out and about. This is the central library for the whole city. Like this is, there are a lot of people here.
Kaladin Shash 03:09:14 Um, is. Am I mean, am I in the why am I out in the open as I was looking at the school for the first time? Yeah, I'll hold. I'll hold. I'll hold off. Yeah, we can. That's it.
Dungeon Master 03:09:36 OK. Anything else from anybody? Yeah, you're with him. You absolutely can.
Kaladin Shash 03:09:43 I think we're just ham hocking. Did we already do that?
Leopold Magnus 03:09:48 I was going to say, can I make one quick check around the library? Or was that just Caledon that headed to the library? Okay, yeah. I was just looking around, kind of perusing books. I'm looking for the history of the city and the dome, and maybe to find any kind of information in regards to districts, specific things, clashes between them.
Leopold Magnus 03:10:17 you know, from its inception to now. Could have been better.
Dungeon Master 03:10:20 Give me an investigation check. Could have been better, but not bad again. You find general history at like through your research, you rule out a couple things. The biggest thing is that New New Arbor and the Southern Dome has been like the most consistent and peaceful of all of them. There have been like.
Dungeon Master 03:10:49 various gangs that rise up through time. There's like, way back when, like, you know, 30 years ago or something like that, there was a, like, an issue of, like, Canthropy and the Storm District. Like, they've had different issues, obviously, as, like, the curse manifests throughout history differently. And you even find some, like, reports of, like, the first initial encounters of, like,
Dungeon Master 03:11:16 First diagnosed isoptrin curse person it found in Southern Dome and this was like just from like a news excerpt from 100 years ago kind of deal. Also, just various things like that, but you don't find like there's nothing that like stands out with the 13. Might be worth checking back on later if you get more information or something, but yeah.
Leopold Magnus 03:11:36 Okay, interesting.
Kaladin Shash 03:11:40 Okay.
Dungeon Master 03:11:49 And same deal, you guys are checking for a while. So with time, it gets to be pretty late in the day. And then we'll call this like the end of the second or third day. So in theory, you're supposed to report back for duty the next day.
Kaladin Shash 03:12:20 Does it does anyone else have any? No air. Great. Yeah, can I? Can I revisit Hamhawk before you report? Sure.
Zariel Torgan 03:12:25 I think all I had was doing a little bit of running around checking things out. I think I'm pretty much set, ready for the next briefing, I guess.
Dungeon Master 03:12:44 Yeah. Uh, I can give you, I haven't made the item yet because I had prepped it for something else, but essentially she can do exactly what you were requesting. Like she transfers the power and then modifies it. So your staff that was also spear pointed has the ability on command to sort of go from being just like, we'll say short sword size, like,
Dungeon Master 03:13:14 a staff plus a blade but now it like transforms and it can like like it has like the enlarged spell cast into it where it turns into a full length spear with one blunted end and of like the fist and the other end is the spear point but that the the appearance of it has changed a bit like as part of the magic transfusion the handle is a little bit more like mycelium appearance it's still like black in color but
Dungeon Master 03:13:44 Um, it's not like a smooth metal anymore. It's like, uh, it has a little bit of wave to it, but it's still made out of metal. It just looks like a natural appearance and it's got some, um, like other damage bonuses and stuff that I'll throw into your sheet, uh, once I make it, but it's got some abilities. Easy enough to do though.
Leopold Magnus 03:13:54 Yep.
Kaladin Shash 03:14:03 That's right. Oh, cool. Yep. Yeah. Of course, dreams.
Dungeon Master 03:14:17 Beautiful. Guys just going to bed for the night? Calling it good? Love it. Kaladin, give me a charisma saving throw. I love this.
Zariel Torgan 03:14:23 I feel good.
Kaladin Shash 03:14:36 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:14:48 You were having a fitful sleep. You, uh, aren't sure what's going on, but just like dark tunnels, you feel like a presence in a space that you can't totally make out. Uh, you are hearing that same Micah voice in the head saying, he's coming for her.
Dungeon Master 03:15:17 over and over and over again. And out of like this dark space in your head, you see like a creature sort of step out of the shadow in your dream. It has an unsettling bend to its body. It seems unnaturally tall if it were standing, but it's like crawling on all fours. It has a skeletal frame contorted into a hunched posture.
Dungeon Master 03:15:47 It almost looks spider-like in how he moves. His limbs and his face are elongated and gaunt, covered in pallid, sickly skin that sort of clings tightly to the bone. The joints are knobby and pronounced, adding to grotesque silhouette. Fingers are long, bony, and tipped with sharp claws.
Dungeon Master 03:16:10 The face has like inflammation around the eyes and nose but the mouth is just this gross maw of pointy teeth. The eyes also spider or fly like are huge black orbs on its face that sort of point at the edges. It looks barely humanoid and in its hand it has like a sickly red blade
Dungeon Master 03:16:36 with like a deep fuller in the middle. And it like crawls out of the darkness in your mind. And you just hear breathing. And then the breathing sort of calms for a second. It changed. The dark space sort of transitions and gives way to grass. The pressure you feel becomes a breeze.
Dungeon Master 03:17:03 You feel the wind blowing on your face and you're in that first person view again, where you feel like you're in that other body. And you see the woman sitting in the grass. She's got no mask on her face in this, but she's smiling and looking at you. But again, it's muted. You don't have the audio.
Dungeon Master 03:17:21 And she says something that you can't hear. And she like puts her hand on your face. And in that moment, you sort of wake up. And you of all will have completed a long rest. And that's the next day. But we're also going to end our session right there. Just call it good. No.
Kaladin Shash 03:17:35 I don't want to get screened. No, it does. No flickering. Right, right. I mean, right, shadowy. You couldn't see much. Who's, who's to say?
Leopold Magnus 03:17:40 Damn.
Zariel Torgan 03:17:40 I'm sure that was just like nothing bad. Probably just like somebody's childhood pet. Yeah, somebody probably is going to come in. Down, Scruffy.
Kaladin Shash 03:18:07 God, man. No, not at all. I take it. No, it's great.
Dungeon Master 03:18:08 You're welcome. Sorry to end it on such a tight note, but that was always going to happen.
Zariel Torgan 03:18:11 Nothing to be alarmed about. She's definitely not going to be brutally murdered by the time we get back. That'd be fine. Oh, man. Well, thank you, Jonathan. That was fun.
Leopold Magnus 03:18:36 Yeah, I mean, you got to end it somewhere. So. Yep, that's that's about right.
Dungeon Master 03:18:41 I was hoping to get to the festival, but things didn't quite progress to that point yet. So we've got that for next session.
Zariel Torgan 03:18:41 Well. Sounds good. All right. Well, I think the next time we'll see each other is Friday night or Saturday morning, right? Sweet.
Kaladin Shash 03:18:49 Yeah. Hey, what was the? Jesse, what was the number of the? Cabin that I'm in just for like parking sake. Whenever I get there, I'm thrilled to be darker. I guess actually check in. Will you just text you will you get text up there? We get texting my friend.
Zariel Torgan 03:19:18 Yeah, I get text, but you just come into the front because you got to get the key anyway, and you just let them know What what you got going on? They'll set you up, but I can also text you guys what cabins are going to be into so we'll do both and Then also you guys should think about what you want to do with your characters You know how you want to sunset them how you want them to live the rest of their life post? Everything working out if that ends up happening
Kaladin Shash 03:19:22 Okay. Perfect. Okay. Yeah. Superman.
Leopold Magnus 03:19:33 Cool.
Dungeon Master 03:19:47 in case you don't e-PKF.
Zariel Torgan 03:19:50 Yeah, I mean, there's a really good chance you're going to just get murked. You know, you are fighting the devil, so. But, you know, we'll see. He just hangs and never gets out. It's like the hero equivalent of never leaving the toilet.
Kaladin Shash 03:19:55 Yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 03:20:00 Yeah, you know, there's a chance Marv can forever hang like a bat. Yep, just hangs from a cave. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:20:19 And then I've got items I'm pretty sure to create for each of you. And then I'll get that upgraded staff for you, Bren. I had started it out as a club, so I just have to change it a little bit. That's great, guys.
Kaladin Shash 03:20:29 Yeah, that's exciting. OK. Well, it's great. It's really exciting.
Zariel Torgan 03:20:29 Sweet. Sweet. Well, I'm excited. A little bit of mystery.
Dungeon Master 03:20:43 You'll learn more about this mysterious figure with time, but I'm good with that. And I'll send just a picture of the inspiration for the creature to Bren. The other guys don't get to see it, unfortunately.
Zariel Torgan 03:21:01 Oh. You know. Describe that dream in detail in character later so I can see it. Awesome. Alright, I'll see you guys. Alright, bye.
Leopold Magnus 03:21:02 Ha ha. Keep us in the dark. Yeah. Yeah, you all have a good night. Later.
Kaladin Shash 03:21:03 Well, my dream man. Later man.
Dungeon Master 03:21:17 All right, guys, good night. All good.

Group Discussion 00:00:00 Did she, like, straight up say that you were, like, the assassin for... No, I added that in later because I was trying to figure out how I wanted it to manifest. But, he is tied directly, and you are tied directly to him. But, we didn't talk about what you were. Who brought this? That's all for everyone. Yeah, breathe. Yeah, breathe.
Group Discussion 00:00:23 Oh, Jesse's about to get in the brie game, dude. Brie is so good. A little honey drizzle. Yeah, yeah, balsamic glaze. Hot honey and brie. Oh, baked brie? You guys are all way classier than I am. These are like New Year's Eve parties.
Group Discussion 00:00:53 You usually get a canned cheese. Cheese whiz. Cheese whiz and spray it. Down my throat. Oh, God. It's like the cheese slime. Jesus Christ. You cheese. You can't see a night if the cheese whiz hits a plate or anything. Yeah. If it's supposed to run straight down your throat. All right. If we find cheese whiz, I'm making a cheese whiz. You're showing off if you're putting it on a plate. That's for sure. I'll splat my head in the pillow of cheese whiz.
Group Discussion 00:01:21 Guys, that's what it is. It's not spider pie. Yeah, it's actually been white cheddar cheese the entire time. It's just like in a plastic bag. Who's brave enough to taste it? I can't believe they're hiding it. It's nut cheese for lemons. So we guys are here.
Group Discussion 00:01:40 what would you and then uh sorry as part of that when you guys are going into the center remember you have prep time as you walk in we'd establish the black root hall with your safe area prep area catch your spells right before you walk in but to i don't know if i can remember how to do a fucking voice as you are in the dark uh cauldron fire lit cabin
Group Discussion 00:02:01 When you're not looking at the perimeter, everything kind of warps out of reality a little bit. It defies the space you're in. You sit on a, like, fur skin rug across from her, but underneath, painted in, like, old faded blood, are all these runes in a language you can't comprehend. She sits there looking at you, a long pipe in her mouth, constantly pushing
Group Discussion 00:02:25 pulling it in and blowing out a deep yellow smoke. Just the thickest shit as she sits there. And she goes, it's your turn, I believe, no? Sure. I would love to hear about my origins. I'm right into it again. I gotta think about the environment. Cleetus. Handsome as you are.
Group Discussion 00:02:55 What do you want to give me for more? Let her cut my finger off. Oh, yes. By the way, as time has faded, Kaladin, you've never had five fingers on that hand. There's not a cut spot. You have a four-fingered wooden hand. It's just smooth. It's the bottom. From everyone else's offerings, it seems she likes pieces of bodies. Not I. Give her your
Group Discussion 00:03:27 I'm circumcised. She's got a chip in her lap and she's petting him and he's like asleep, just kicking a little bit as she's like under a spell and she's just petting him in the next moment. She wants shit. I don't care about this thing. It's a rodent. I eat these. What straps do you think?
Group Discussion 00:03:51 If I might ask. Well, I give you information. You tell me what you think it's worth. I tell you if it's fair or not. I take the information back. Fair? Sure. Beast Lord. Oh, shoot. Yes. Did you not know? Your affinity for the nut makes sense. Oh, my God. Well, there's two things I love. It's nuts and beasts. Amen to that, Lord. Preferably... Oh, I guess they are together. I prefer the nut in beats myself, but that's fine.
Group Discussion 00:04:29 is annoying. The way I see it is Lord of the Beastlands, western region of the Feywild, west of the mountains even, should have a right to the throne ascension, some power in play. I have to ask, why this creature, if you have such an affinity and she's like holding it, turning it upside down, still asleep, why this one? You know,
Group Discussion 00:04:56 I'm a humble man. Work hard. Chip's a simple man too. We get together. We get along. I don't need much in this life. I found him a way. I find that particular in that you attained so much in previous lives. Very motivated man. What do you think? What is this worth?
Group Discussion 00:05:23 The next time you look at her, she's petting a large almond. Chippin' on your shoulder. I mean, my hands is what I use to cultivate land and summon beasts. My left hand, perhaps?
Group Discussion 00:05:50 I'm pretty, uh, ambidextrous. I cloud Cletus. Roll, roll for ambidextrous. Oh god. Cletus Gallatin only gave a finger. Yeah, he got some good shit for a finger. I got a ten. I'm perfectly neutral at both. Yeah, it's just terrible. How about this? I take your left hand. And I take the rights to the almond farm. Hmm.
Group Discussion 00:06:20 How about my green squirrely thumb on my left and my phone? I'm already getting the left hand. It's gone. It's mine. It's already gone. She's like... Is this fair to you? Did you sound the right calls? Your hand and... My own business. We change it to be that you were just previously a little bit more left-handed. I feel satisfied.
Group Discussion 00:06:50 I do a horrible handshake with my right. She like without moving her arm goes all the way over the cauldron and wraps around your left hand and she just pulls it off and your hand is a nub about.
Group Discussion 00:07:03 mid-wrist. Awful. I duct tape Chip to my arm. He's now my hand. I like this. I have three hands now. She's making a necklace in that second. There's a little finger on one side, the hand in the middle. A little miniature version of a robot body with a hole in it where she threads the thread as part of her necklace and she's like stitching it together as part of something. And then this is when she gives you the cloak and kicks you all out. She goes, oh, by the way, Cletus, um,
Group Discussion 00:07:34 Took your hand. It was a little shitty of me. How about you get a little bit more control over beasts? Sure. Snaps your fingers. And you, once a day, can cast Dominate Monster. Ooh, damn.
Group Discussion 00:08:03 Because there's a hole in it. The screen door has a hole in it. You got to do the glass door. Come on. Lay down. I'm going to sit here and squeak. It's so warm in the sun. She's just being extra. Let's go. Cool? Are you squeaking? Let's hit my straw hat.
Group Discussion 00:08:57 392 hit points. You gotta close it all the way, dude. I'd like to crack to get some air flowing. Just force your way through it. Come on, Razzle. Razzle. An escape artist.
Group Discussion 00:09:27 No wonder I'm so connected to the Rizzlers you should be pretty familiar
Group Discussion 00:10:00 I loved it when you did it, so. 709. I can change that feed if I want. 790. I just didn't want to take my time. 790. And an exclamation. Hey, sweetheart. You're so dapper. You're a handsome boy.
Group Discussion 00:10:31 Because I could do Freedom of the Winds on somebody. Mine's here. Did you choose one? Yeah. Staff.
Group Discussion 00:10:50 Does anybody want to be, like, a T-Rex for a bit? Does anybody want to be, like... I can do that Freedom of the Wind spell. I mean, they're both concentrations, but... Freedom of the Wind is huge. But that's the one where, yeah, as a reaction, if you get, like, targeted, you can just teleport somewhere. You can fly. There's a Leopold here. Leopold? None of these look like Leopolds at all. I realize I don't have the other one. It, like, fell out somewhere.
Group Discussion 00:11:22 That's just the only mini I have. It's not.
Group Discussion 00:11:34 Heroic Feast. Oh yeah. What was that, a plus? It's a plus 2d10, whatever you guys rolled. 2d10? Temporary? Temporary. Well, it's temporary, but if you get healed up, or if you take a long rest, it goes back up to that for a whole 24 hours. So it's temporary, but temporary. Oh man, I can't even remember what I had rolled.
Group Discussion 00:11:57 Oh, so it's an actual increase to maximum. It increases your maximum for 24 hours. Got a 9 and a 10. Oh, Jesus. Yeah, I rolled a 5. I got 9. Okay, we've rested leading up to this, correct? Yeah, Kevin. Well, I have the Anadagni, so that's probably from last time. Yeah, you rested since then. Oh, yeah. You got way better than me. I'll do a 6 and a 1. Um...
Group Discussion 00:12:27 did anybody want a polymorph or a freedom of the winds because i'm gonna probably be my wild shape i mean i think we should probably do at least one polymorph doesn't that make sense i was kind of thinking that but it's but it limits the character to be like an ape or a t-rex or something yeah and so somebody has to be okay with it i mean i can do it on myself i guess i'm i'm i'm fine i could do an ape or a t-rex or whatever you're feeling you want to be a want to
Group Discussion 00:12:58 For what? For him to be a T-Rex. We're just going to need to preload that. It's temporary, but it lasts for 24 hours. As long as you remember to bring it back, because it'll take away from that first when you take damage, but just remember to put it back. I did a temporary override because it shows bright green, like something's wrong, it's not standard, and then that way I remember.
Group Discussion 00:13:26 We'll take it away later. Yeah, after we long rest. When you're on a T-Rex, what is its size? I think it's huge. For comparison. I don't know. Let me just check it out real quick. So a T-Rex is, let's see, huge beast. This is our Gargoyle.
Group Discussion 00:14:04 That mini is sick. That is a Demogorgon without its arms. Its arms are gone yet. Did you paint that? Thank you. I think that one came. These ones are his. I bought some little ones today, but I didn't see anything big. You guys fought for the finale. That's what I one-turned.
Group Discussion 00:14:30 pretty impressive that was crazy that doesn't happen you know yeah just i'm gonna force a wet almond down cyrus's gullet oh somebody already decided who got it you and your almonds i think who didn't we roll for or something like who got the almond well whoever had that idea i did it at the start of the long rest i don't i know that i did not i don't remember i did just bend them because they did the twin soul thing yeah okay
Group Discussion 00:15:01 That's why I said that. You think you wouldn't need to give him an almond? You think you just... You just have it. I feel like I don't need it every day. That's just how it works, though. I love that you just need to, like, you have it, but he's like, no, almond. Right. It's just so damp. It's just like I feel wet. Soggy almond.
Group Discussion 00:15:39 Oh, I know. So I'm gonna be a T-Rex, huh? Let's see, is there any other, I don't know if I really have any buff spells that I can, oh, I could cast heroism. Let's see.
Group Discussion 00:16:12 I want to cast Guardian of Nature on myself. Go for it. Great Tree version. I get 10 temporary hit points. Constitution saving throws with advantage. Dexterity and Wisdom base attack rolls with advantage. I'm going to go out 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Within 15 feet of me, terrain is difficult for enemies.
Group Discussion 00:16:42 Okay, I can give out four heroism. Four? Yeah, four total. What is heroism? It's temporary hit points. Oh, yeah. Can you stack that with the hero piece or whatever? Yeah. And you regain them at the end of your turn, so it's five. Yeah, because the temporary hit points aren't actual. It's an increase to your max. Okay, cool.
Group Discussion 00:17:10 So it's five temporary hit points at the start of your turn. Which is pretty good. That's 20 HP total around the group if we all take hits. And that just resets while you hold concentration or just is up? I gotta be concentration. Concentration. Okay. So you cast that right before you became a T-Rex? Yep, that was what I was thinking.
Group Discussion 00:17:37 I can concentrate if I'm, like, polymorphed, right? I assume. If something's already started? No, druids can. Druids can. Nobody else can. Oh, so I can't do that, then. Yeah, so it doesn't matter yet. Okay, I'll hold on to that. Hold on to that one. And I don't think I have any other, like, buffs that aren't just concentration, so... How about we get some initiative? Done. What's in that, Tony? Get ready for it. Come on. It's gonna be a bunch.
Group Discussion 00:18:10 I keep saying they're making like these one. That's crazy the full setting a little cute. Yeah, I chose the chest X They're making jungle ones and I keep looking at them
Group Discussion 00:18:38 All right, dirty 20, 15 plus five. Fuck. Let me roll initiative. Initiative. I'm supposed to sleep. The natural one. Through the monster? Ah, nice, 20. Nat 20? Dirty 20. Calum? There we go. Dirty 20. Who has got the higher dex between you? I think I do.
Group Discussion 00:19:08 My dex is, yeah, I think Caladin has it. My dex is 14. I like those. Yeah, those were Jonathan's. Which ones? I think those green ones. Or maybe Jesse's. Which ones? Shrek dice. Oh yeah, those aren't mine. And then like the graphite. At the start of initiative, we are kind of where you are. Everybody got the buffs they want?
Group Discussion 00:19:39 Yeah, you're polymorphed, right? Yeah, well, yeah, I think that was the plan. And this is currently wrecking buffing? Is that what you're saying? Yes. Can I get a semi-small one? Meaning for my fire elemental? I'm the same, but I'm covered in bark. I got some willow tree shoulder pads.
Group Discussion 00:20:11 the gold tassels on my soldier uniforms.
Group Discussion 00:20:34 All right, so who's this? This is Leopold as a T-Rex. This is Zariel as an Earth Elemental. I think I'm going to do water, actually. Here's Chip. Because this guy's on fire right now. Yeah, he's like a cinder diamond. This comes into play later. I won't tell you why for now, but this will be your money. That's the Water Elemental. Is that like the king in one of the prequels?
Group Discussion 00:21:03 Yes. The underwater guy that Jar Jar Binks swims to? Yeah. Me so Jar Jar. Calum, initiative. You have initiative 21, we'll say. What would you like to do first? These are five foot squares, so it's roughly like 70 by 50. Yeah, I think my first action will do... I'll cast haste on myself.
Group Discussion 00:21:36 I'm going to use my bonus action to go ahead and rip off all three of my Soptric Blasts. Okay. So my other action will be a melee, so I'll use all three for that in a second. And then I'm going to go ahead and use the second action to cast Mirror Image. Nice. Is my cape still working?
Group Discussion 00:22:05 Is my cape still working in different forms, or is that just me? I'm going to say no, because your equipment morphs into your body, so it's not physically doing anything like making displays. And then, remind me, what does haste do to... AC goes up by two, advantage on dexterity, saving throws, and your speed doubles. I should be able to... Your hasted action can only be used to attack, uh, object, it's like very limited. Well, I think it can be attack, dash, um,
Group Discussion 00:22:37 Okay, so I've got plenty of movement. Are we calling these 10 feet or 5 feet? 5 feet. Okay. We're really close. We're really close. With hasted movement? Yeah. 100%. I'm just going to get within about here, because that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 20 feet. Right. Okay. Then I will get on top of my lightning bolt.
Group Discussion 00:23:15 These will be to a hit for the socket blasts A 16 won't hit on the first one. I imagine about a nat 20 for 28 damn and then 21
Group Discussion 00:23:48 Roll your damage separate. It'll probably make a difference. Roll my damage separate? Yeah. Oh, you mean do the crit first? Yeah. Or roll it out once and tell me which damage it's with.
Group Discussion 00:24:05 All right, the first one hit for 13, and the second one is for regular for another seven, so 20 force damage as I move forward. Okay, your esophagus blast hit. You see a little bit of bark flies off, but ultimately doesn't seem like you do any damage. Oh, wow. No force damage? Force seems to hit its body, but there is something about it that did not seem to do anything. Doesn't land. Noted. I relay this. And that's what we get with the first thing.
Group Discussion 00:24:35 At the end of your turn, at its first legendary action... I can't multi-attack the same creature, can I? It's multi-attack? Yeah, multi-attack just means you can get more than once. No, it just says that you make two attacks with its bite or one with its tail. Can't make both against the same creature. It's going to burn all three of its legendary actions and do Cinder Burst. Each creature within 20 feet must make a
Group Discussion 00:25:03 Constitution saving throw or take some amount of damage. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. Yeah, you might be able to bite and then use movement to move around and then tail. I didn't know you moved. I thought you were right next to it. Oh, no, that's why whenever you moved it, I was like, oh, I want to be close. Silly close.
Group Discussion 00:25:31 Are you more than 20 feet away? No, I'm right at 20. Oh no! Jesus! Alright. Alright. I'm not seeing that one ability. Which one? The one where I get to do extra damage. Some of your special traits, right? Features and traits. Nice. Powerful build.
Group Discussion 00:26:06 I saw it on my build, but I don't see it. What did you get hit with? I don't know. I don't know yet. I thought it was a basic warp thing. I need to make a con save. You said warp the thing was, but I don't know yet. It's okay. Don't worry about it. It's fine. It's important. What'd you get? I'll figure it out later. Not good. I got a 10. I think that's enough. 10 is a failure. As long as he doesn't roll dice again.
Group Discussion 00:26:33 You take 9 fire damage. Okay. Fire resistant. Yeah, since I broke it up. So 9 divided by 2, so you take 4. And then you take 11 necrotic damage. You know, that sounded... Okay, never mind. Be careful. Okay, and then Leopold, you are up next. Okay. Also, you're paralyzed. For breaking that up, you're a nuke.
Group Discussion 00:27:03 Azariel, how do you describe the T-Rex? What does it look like? So instead of scaled, it's like that faux leather. It's very slippery looking.
Group Discussion 00:27:17 Yeah, like very reflective. Almost like I'm in a latex suit. Kind of like a little too stretchy. You're just going to stick to it. And then like, shh, as you rip up. Oh, God. Other than that, you're normal. Same colors as a T-Rex you would expect? No, black. Black. Yours is like a soft T-Rex. The T-Rex sense of bonding. It looks like you kind of squish even though you look muscular. I'm just going to let out a roar, like a loud roar. Roar, roar, roar.
Group Discussion 00:27:45 I'll turn to Zariel and say... Because we've got the flowers, right? Well, this... I don't know about this plush leather here. This is... Well, he's doing the mental... With the flower, yeah. But yeah, all you're hearing is a roar and then you're getting that. I turn. He's very unsure about his lifestyle. It's about comfort and movement.
Group Discussion 00:28:14 I don't know if either of those apply. Is there like a spot around my mouth and eyes that is like normal? Just scales for your lips. And then I'm going to move up. Scaly lips. And then I was talking to Jesse, but I guess the multi-tact is only one of the two if it's on the same creature. What?
Group Discussion 00:28:40 Something about the multi-attack being only against one creature. So it says for the T-Rex page, because the T-Rex can hit with its tail and it can bite, they can do one of each. Okay. If it's on different targets. But we were thinking, since it's so big, it wouldn't be an unreasonable thing. You could just turn and hit with its tail, but it would leave a few, obviously. So you can do a multi-attack or a tail attack normally. I know, just multi-attack or one of them. Yeah.
Group Discussion 00:29:09 If you can bite and tail. Or just bite if it's one creature. Yeah, I thought it seemed kind of silly. But anyway, just spin around and whack it. Right, so I'm going to do both? Yep. I'll take my multi-attack. A huge difference damage wise. Ooh, 29. Nice. 29 hits. Okay. Roll your damage differently on each attack.
Group Discussion 00:29:37 It'll come relevant later. 4d12 plus 7. I'll just roll 8. I'll just roll this twice. That's 14 plus... 7. 21. 28 damage on the bite. And then for the tail...
Group Discussion 00:30:10 19. 19. First attack, you take a huge chunk out of the bark. It starts to heal up afterwards, but it takes the damage, all 28 of it. 19 doesn't seem to register. Interesting. Okay, now I will move the last little bit of my movement. I'll just kind of circle around behind.
Group Discussion 00:30:35 And I'll try to get up. I'll try to kind of scuff it with my little arms. Okay, after that, since it used all its legendary actions, nothing happens. But...
Group Discussion 00:30:58 It will use its reaction to do Blistering Reap. When it is damaged, it will take a sweep with its halberd. It's got like this fiery sword. Each creature within 20 feet must make a dexterity saving throw. This is a recharge ability, so it doesn't have it all the time. Plus zero on my dex.
Group Discussion 00:31:23 While they're rolling, my guardian nature gives me advantage with wisdom attacks. Is that my spell since I'm wisdom class? Sorry. Okay, you didn't take damage from force? No. Didn't look like you did. What physical damage did it? Is that what happened? He said that 19 didn't hit. He said that weird.
Group Discussion 00:31:52 Yeah, 19 didn't hit. Well, he said it didn't register. He'd say it didn't hit. Sure. Deck save, 26. Passes. That's a plus 10 and I got full advantage. Five on mine. Five fails. Passes. So you take 15 fire damage reduced by half and you take 11 necrotic
Group Discussion 00:32:20 Well, you're resistant, right? 26. Well, the half was the fire. It was 7 plus 11. Oh, gotcha. That was easy. Well, you... Oh. I thought it was quartered half. Quartered fire damage because you just seeded and are resistant. So I thought it would have been quartered. Oh, yeah, true. That was what I was thinking. So just... It'd be 3 damage. Yeah. I mean, every little bit counts. Every little bit counts. Add it back. Cyrus, you're up next. Okay. Okay.
Group Discussion 00:33:01 Working its business, I have to dash action to get kind of close. So I'm going to do those actions. I'm going to save my bonuses. It's going to flatten out the map a lot. It's just caught on itself because it's two separate sheets. You're not going to tear it. Stupid trap. I just moved this time. I'm going to save my bonus actions. I'm going to do spells, cast, and dash actions.
Group Discussion 00:33:30 Okay. After that is clean. Yep. I had it kind of cropped up. Are these five foot blocks? Yes. So that's 20. I want to move to be within 30 feet. Is that right? Yeah. 25, 20? Yep. That should be right.
Group Discussion 00:33:55 And I'm going to hold up my staff and use Channel Divinity, Order's Demand. And it needs to make a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until my next turn.
Group Discussion 00:34:22 Does it? Oh, there it is. So it needs to be the 16 wisdom say. 16 wisdom say.
Group Discussion 00:34:36 That is a 25. That is a 16 plus 9. Wonderful. Wisdom save. Goddamn, plus 9 on wisdom? Okay. It is proficient. Epic. I don't think you were there when I said the CR. This is a CR 17 creature. Jesus, fuck!
Group Discussion 00:34:56 That is the power balance I have to do. That's pretty good. Does it take anything on a half? It just has to save because then it gets charmed. I'll give you this for free. When you do it, even though it passes with the dice roll, it almost seems like the charm would not have held. It doesn't have a high enough intelligence to be charmed. Interesting.
Group Discussion 00:35:26 Okay. Okay. After that, it is its turn proper. It will get one square closer to be within a reach of both without leaving the T-Rex, so to kind of swing a little bit around. Like that? Yeah. Okay. And at the start of its turn, so previously the only one that was in space is T-Rex Leopold. Because of its presence, you take 2d6 fire damage just being too close to it, as again,
Group Discussion 00:35:58 You take four fire damage. Four fire damage? That was picked up a long time ago. That was whenever I killed that red dragon closer to the match. Oh, wow. Well sourced in our own dome. Okay, and then you take two attacks and use one bonus action if it has any available. In or out, in or out. Hey, sweetie. Hi. Hi, sweet baby. Come here.
Group Discussion 00:36:27 Look how tiny the head is. Well, it's not really that tiny, it's just... It's just not Bubbles' head. It's just not Bubbles' head. I pre-rolled the attack, so first one will be a 23 to hit Cyrus, and then it'll be a 31 to hit T-Rex. Oh yeah, that hit him. Cyrus, you take 28 slashing, 9 necrotic. Wait for your image.
Group Discussion 00:36:51 No, no. It's him. Oh, he's melee. He's melee right now. Leopold, you take 32 slashing, 11 necrotic. And then that has nothing else. 43 damage. It's always more stressful in person. Mine's really more stressful. What did you get? 16. 16. You should have gone.
Group Discussion 00:37:18 Let's double check mine. Jonathan, you said, what was it, sorry? 23 and 11? 32 slashing 11 necrotic. 32 and 11. Okay, so I've got... 43 total. I'm going to use...
Group Discussion 00:37:49 my Whelm, and it's a DC 15 strength saving throw on a damage, on a failure, the creature takes 2d8 plus 4 bludgeoning damage, and if it's smaller, I grapple it, but it's not smaller. So, just a big wave that's gonna splash forward. What kind of save? Uh, strength, DC 15. It's gonna make it, that's just nothing else I have in my reach. Yeah, 25. Okay, and nothing happens. But I'm there, I'm close.
Group Discussion 00:38:20 And then after that, so it was the end of initiative. So back up to the top is Kaladin. Is this all like border? Yeah, it's a wall that goes up. You are in like an A shaped room.
Group Discussion 00:38:53 Who's up? I'm going. Uh... It doesn't say this costs an action or anything, but using my manifestation or letting it come forward, it just happens. So I already look pretty fae, just because I've got my mask on. And then as I begin to approach this, you guys see that I just get even more fae-like. My ears get a little longer, a little taller. Pretty sweet. Uh...
Group Discussion 00:39:24 I'm going to go ahead and just take what would be three attacks, because the bonus action is a single at melee. It's a nat 20. That's two nat 20s in the round? That's fantastic. Oh yeah, because I got one on the Aesop trick. Just counting them for the day.
Group Discussion 00:39:48 And that's a 18 to hit, won't hit. And the last one's going to be a 19, which is now also a critical. Oh, damn. So I'm rolling two crits. Holy shit. Well, 19s and 20s are crits. Yeah. Fantastic. For being a fighter.
Group Discussion 00:40:07 That's okay, that's okay. Again, everything matters. I'll say why this lost a lot of the illusion now. Part of its natural Burning Husk ability, which is what makes you take fire damage, it is a damage threshold until it hits a certain HP. You have to do at least 20 damage in a single attack
Group Discussion 00:40:25 for all of the damage to register, otherwise it's null. It doesn't take any. Is that every single attack, or is that per round? Yes, attack. So one strike, two strike, each have to hit over 20 damage until it's weaned down enough. Otherwise, no damage null. No damage under 20. So everything has to be over 20. You guys as characters don't know that yet, but as players, you can adjust the play style as your characters would be going for the bigger hitting stuff.
Group Discussion 00:40:50 All right, so that's... You all have the ability. I went through the damage log of our D&D Beyond Encounter thing, checking everybody's damage. It's doable. The first crit is 34. 34. And then here's the second crit.
Group Discussion 00:41:10 1, 7, 12, 13, 15 plus 14, 29, and then 2d6. 4 plus 3 plus 7, so 36 on the second critical. Jesus!
Group Discussion 00:41:29 Good hits, that's a lot of damage. You're at like close to 100 already for the initiative. And then I'm going to use my bonus action because I missed an attack to go ahead and take an attack with my bonus action.
Group Discussion 00:41:49 It's not enough. 17 is not enough. 17 doesn't count. Okay. As a reaction, it'll see if it recharges, so this needs to be a 5 or a 6. It's a 3. It does not do its, like, cinder cleave as it gets hit. After your turn, however, it will use... How many of you are close?
Group Discussion 00:42:20 Yeah. I'm still with you guys. Everybody give me, everybody who's in that range give me a dexterity save. No problem. Dex save. 19. Natural 20. 13. I got a 29. 29 passes. Natural 20 passes. 13 over there. 13 fails. Anybody under 18 is a failure. Okay.
Group Discussion 00:42:50 T-Rex is taking some bites. 136, but...
Group Discussion 00:43:04 21 fire damage and 12 necrotic damage. 21 and 12. So if you were resistant to one, half. And then what was the other part of that? What was the necrotic? 12 necrotic. 17 again. If you pass, it's half damage. What was the total for half? It's 31 and 12, so... 31 and...
Group Discussion 00:43:28 Sorry, 21 and 12. 21 and 12? 16? Yes.
Group Discussion 00:43:41 Do you get some of these points? Is it one reaction per round of everybody? Yeah, so once your turn hits, you have your reaction again each time. T-Rex is almost down. Okay, then I get back to me. So it's the start of your turn, you have your reaction again. So it comes back at the beginning of the other turn. After Taladin, it is Leopold. Ah!
Group Discussion 00:44:11 And I'm just going to bite it right on its rump. Right behind here. So would I be able to get flanking? No, it hasn't stepped forward yet. I don't need to. You can grapple check one size larger than your own creature. You're a huge, this is a gargantuan. You could try to grapple this creature. If I hit? If you want to. It sacrifice one of your attacks, but you could do it. Oh, okay. And then you could, in theory, try to move it.
Group Discussion 00:44:42 You don't have to. And these are just branches. It's like an egg-shaped room, so it's all burning branches and stuff. Okay. 24 to hit? 24 hits. Okay, so 24 on the bite. No, you won out there. It's okay. Yeah, they went on a walk, and he's all fired up. 4d12 plus 7. Goddamn.
Group Discussion 00:45:09 Yeah, 4d12, yeah. You got a d12 I can borrow? Nice, cool, thanks. Makes it a little easier. Ah, two, three ones and a three. Fuck that. Wow. Six. Yeah.
Group Discussion 00:45:31 six plus seven yeah so not even enough to all right so there's that hit and then 27 to hit for the tail and that's
Group Discussion 00:45:56 This is my old guy. The tail is 3D8. 3D8. So, 8, 9, and then...
Group Discussion 00:46:19 Nice. That would be 16 plus 7. 23. Nice.
Group Discussion 00:46:37 23 damage on the tail. Made some damage. That bite was pitiful. There's several things that I can't really use to break that 20 threshold. I'm noticing that my damage is 2d8 plus 4.
Group Discussion 00:47:04 Yeah, you can get that. Yeah, there's no issues there. Oh yeah, because that's per strike. Yeah, it's 2d8 plus 4. So like for a multi-attack, even if you did two actions, that wouldn't... I'm going to move to flank with my... That's why those crits were nice, otherwise I have to roll pretty high just to get myself up to that 20-ish mark. Do I get an advantage for flanking? 2d10 plus 7 plus 4. I roll... I have a plus...
Group Discussion 00:47:40 We love that. So plus seven to hit. We love that. So for the first one, natural 20. That's all 20 hits. For the first one. And then for the second one, plus seven. Oh, my God. So that's two natural 20s. Let's go. Hell, yeah. Get in there. Maybe have a D8. What do you need a D8 for? Just one. Oh, every talent. I like this one more, though.
Group Discussion 00:48:08 The knock-offs are still really good. I do like those. What do you need? Probably made by the same factory. I don't want to hurt this thing. Look at that. It's pretty amazing. Don't hurt yourself. Yeah, those things are... Oh, look at that. What's that? Jingle.
Group Discussion 00:48:36 8 plus 7 plus 7. Oh yeah. That's not bad. So 16. So 23 plus 8. That's 31. That's enough. And then on the second hit. Not as hot. 12 plus 8. So exactly 20. Yes, enough. Wait, you rolled 2 crits on each attack? Yeah. And then does the water damage do anything?
Group Discussion 00:49:10 He's an elemental. Yeah, I'm a water elemental. Well, it says bludgeoning damage, but I mean, I'm made of water. You're hitting him with a fucking piece of water. There is no water damage, there is cold damage, if you want to try to say you do that damage instead.
Group Discussion 00:49:29 Well, I could try to say a lot of things. It is resistant to cold damage. Oh, well, I don't want to do that. I'll just do bludgeoning damage. And because you're a magical creature, I'm going to count it as magical damage. Well, my bludgeon shape lets me do that, so yeah. Otherwise, it is also...
Group Discussion 00:49:50 Yes, they did. Drowning is bludgeoning damage? Well, it's like, how do they classify it? They need to put it somewhere. Water's choking you out. I like force, personally. Or, like, necrotic. I think necrotic makes sense. I'll give you that. I like that. I almost like poison damage. Oh, poison is perfect! Because it's CO2. It's not the lack of oxygen, it's the buildup of CO2. And you can't gas exchange.
Group Discussion 00:50:18 Sariel, that's your full turn? Yeah, yeah, that's attack, attack, two slam attacks. My boy Cyrus, you are up. All right. All that water? He's flanking, I'm not flanking, correct? Yes. He is a large enough creature that you could get right next to him and also be flanking. Yeah, I mean you could move, right? As in like over here?
Group Discussion 00:50:41 Yeah, other way, because the T-Rex takes up so much space that you could get next to Zario. Oh, okay. And he's flanking the T-Rex. He's so slippery, he could slip right into his legs. I am made out of pleather. Yeah, is that a pleather? Yes. It's because of the size of Leofold currently. I like the distinction right here. It's just leather, not just leather. Water runs right off. That's why I'm way over it. Yeah. 20 hits. Nice. 20 exactly hits. Okay, now we're not...
Group Discussion 00:51:10 There's the bar. Okay. I did roll the maintain concentration. I saw that. It pops up. Oh, it does? Yeah. Okay, cool. You did it on your phone, so... Yeah. Already? Those are fine.
Group Discussion 00:51:24 Almond is digesting. What's the almond do? He has to run it by Trace. Trace has to approve it being used. I thought that was just a passive buff.
Group Discussion 00:51:41 No, you have to choose when to enact it. In theory, they have a berry equivalent thing and then Trace activates it. But we have it as you ingest it and then it happens when he wants it. Nice. He's pretty nasty with it. Got a 9-11 in there.
Group Discussion 00:52:22 It's a big head. 12, 16, 18, 19 more. And then we'll do pensive footage just for fun. 37, 56.
Group Discussion 00:52:33 Yeah, plus 19. Plus another 11. I see 7 damage. Holy shit. Razzle, come here. Come here, Razzle. Come here. You're like really being a butthead right now. Come here. Come here, sit down.
Group Discussion 00:52:59 So for the dex, this is a dex save. 13.
Group Discussion 00:53:26 I think you failed. I forgot this the first time. It's push back 10 feet in False Pro. I hit this wall. Oh shit.
Group Discussion 00:53:35 I just forgot. You break the wall and you fall back. The total damage is 16 fire and 20 necrotic. 16 fire and 20? That was a heavy roll.
Group Discussion 00:54:00 What was the range on that? I might lose concentration on that. Half was 18 on fire. Wait, 36. I gotta roll 18 on my con save. You might drop on this one. That's alright. The T-Rex is nearly dead. I just rolled a 20. And it was 20 necrotic and 16 fire. Yeah, it drops anyways.
Group Discussion 00:54:24 Oh, well that's good to know actually. Does the other, the remaining damage spills over onto Leopold, right? Yes, yes. Okay, so. It used its reaction to do that. 20 Anacrotic, 16. So 46 damage, all right. So I'll take six damage as Leopold. After your turn, it is Cletus.
Group Discussion 00:54:56 Who's fucked up? I'm halfway right now. Halfway? I keep getting... I haven't failed one of the dodges yet. And you're still just getting beat up. Yeah. The T-Rex had 156 or something hit points and it went down. Yeah.
Group Discussion 00:55:21 It's taking full damage. It's looking pretty beat up, we should say. Nobody's checked in. It's taking significant damage. Yeah, you did. How much damage in your last hit? You essentially need one more attack to go through to drop the Burnt Us ability.
Group Discussion 00:55:42 What does a short rest do? I always forget. What do we get to get back with a short rest? Your abilities will specify if you get anything back.
Group Discussion 00:55:58 So you get special charges on a short rest, like all warrior, all fighter class stuff is short rest based. What are you looking to get? Well, I have a healing thing, but it also grants benefits of short rest, so I don't know if that's something... And it does do... That's great for Kaladin and stuff, who has... Wizards can recover spell slots on short rest. Okay, have you used much yet? No, I've only used like a two to three. We'll save that. So I only get to use that spell once per long rest, so I'll save that one.
Group Discussion 00:56:27 Okay, then I'll cast a fourth level healing word on Cyrus. And with my new... Oh, sorry, yeah. And my...
Group Discussion 00:56:43 Cleric order now. When I heal somebody, they get to use... Wait, let me go back to it. Butcher it. If I cast a spell with a spell slot of first level or higher and target an ally with the spell, the ally can use their reaction immediately and use a one-weapon attack against a creature of your choice. I'm going to heal you. That's a spell target I use, so you get to use a reaction to attack. Take that.
Group Discussion 00:57:13 I left a space, though. You can throw something, right? I can attack and work. I don't need healing, though, or it's not immediate. I can attack and heal. Okay. But...
Group Discussion 00:57:26 Okay, well, I'm still going to heal you, though. So are these Braining Smites? Can I do that? It says a bonus action. Can I do that? Yeah, Braining Smite is you cast a smite onto your sword, and then you concentrate until you hit, and when you hit, it goes away. So if you miss and you're concentrating, it holds. So it's just until you connect. Yes. But since it's a bonus action, I could do that, and then I could take my attacks. You need an action attack attack, yeah. Oh, hell yeah. But then only the first one gets it, because as soon as it's used...
Group Discussion 00:57:59 You guys have the coolest freaking dice. 3, 7, 11, 14, 17, 18, 22, 24. Can I pick up your little dice? Jesse, do you want to use some good cool dice? No, my bad dice are rolling really good.
Group Discussion 00:58:23 Do you want to switch to these ones? Oh, I love those. Thank you. What are those, Jonathan? These are our Rose City Special Edition, yeah. Cool. I'll try these. I'll have to use some of these things. Are those like plated?
Group Discussion 00:58:42 They're plated. I don't know. I don't know what that means. Oh, I was just wondering. They have like a metal... Yeah, they're metal. Oh, hell yeah. No, that'd be if I heal. If I heal, you heal. Okay. I don't think there's any other bonus out here for me. Those are cool. They're free sleep, yeah. This is an Elden Ring one with metal. Okay.
Group Discussion 00:59:12 She's squeaking non-stop. You guys have extra space behind you, right? You want to shift over a little bit? This way? Yeah. Maybe go like a... Go like that a little bit, maybe? There we go. Nice.
Group Discussion 00:59:40 I was hoping to get him trapped to the attack. It's funny getting us all squished in here. He's working pretty well. We're managing. Okay. I'm a Luigi and I'm gonna win. That'd be a pretty good D&D voice. You just play fucking Mario or Luigi. Okay.
Group Discussion 01:00:09 You're just like a little halfling. Your turn is the Cinder Durian's turn. Anybody who is within 10 feet takes 2d6 fire damage. Negative. Thank god. I think I am. 2d6? It's Leopold and Zario. It takes 6 fire damage. 6 fire damage. It's just searing heat. And the more pissed off it gets, the hotter it seems to get.
Group Discussion 01:00:39 What spell level spell did you cast? Fourth. Okay, you're fine. Anything under fourth, let me know. That's something different. Anything under fourth? Healing spells under... Specifically healing? Healing spells specifically.
Group Discussion 01:00:57 You know that the Tree of Death gives off a diminishing effect on healing spells. Here, especially, it seems way stronger. Okay, noted. Starting at certain people take damage, it rolls to see if it gets its abilities back. We're hoping that we don't get a five or a six. We're hoping. It will bonus action.
Group Discussion 01:01:25 Flicker step. So it explodes in a burning pile of leaves. And you two take fire damage as it goes. And it will appear right here. How much damage are we taking? Yeah. Hold on. It appears within 30 feet. The area behind is ignited, becoming difficult terrain until the end of its next turn.
Group Discussion 01:01:52 Any creature that enters or starts its turn there takes 2d8 fire damage. So if not yet... Where's the... Is it only where it was standing? Yes. Well, it's the area around. 10 feet. So we'll take that at the start of our turn. It is now itself in difficult terrain. So reduced movement. I hate getting knocked down when it's not your turn because you spend the entire turn just...
Group Discussion 01:02:20 oh yeah wait so my t-rex died am I still prone because I got knocked back I think so then yes you are prone so I should be also prone son of a bitch so we both got I'm going to go on my back I'm going to go on my back if I can choose we'll call it supine he'll make an attack on Kaladin and Leopold sorry that's Cletus and then he will also do
Group Discussion 01:02:49 His ability, Roots of Black Flame. He's going to double down on you guys. So he picks a 20-foot radius center of play within 60 feet that you can see.
Group Discussion 01:03:07 What is he doing? A necrotic root bursts out of the ground and swipes at both of you. You guys need to give me a dexterity saving throw. While you're prone, you can't even make the dexterity saving throw. I think it's disadvantage. In theory, you can tip out of the way. There are ways to move. It's just really hard unless you're super dexterous. I think if you're stunned, you auto-fail. If you're prone, it's just disadvantage. Lowest of two.
Group Discussion 01:03:34 14. And then the hits on Callum is a natural shield point. 14. The hit on Cleanness is a 21. It's okay, you take 27 slashing damage, 9 necrotic. Natural 1 on the safe. And then 14. That's right. If you get hit really bad, just remember you have it. Yeah, save myself a spell slot.
Group Discussion 01:04:05 28 points of necrotic damage. That's healing? Yeah. What? No, fuck you. And you are restrained until the end of your next turn. What was the save? Because I rolled a 14. Until the end of my next turn, it's 18. 18 is its... So necrotic... Okay. Let's see. I can't be prone. I'm not elemental.
Group Discussion 01:04:29 I'll still take the damage. So I've got this Absorb Elements. It's a necrotic and it's not an element. Is it? Okay. Then I'll use that as a reaction. And I think that makes me resistant. Capture some of the incoming energy. I have resistance to the triggering damage. And the first time I hit with a melee attack...
Group Discussion 01:04:57 It'll take an extra 1d6. Yes, so you take half of that. So it was 28 halved? Yes. What was it? 26. 26. No, it was 28, because it was... I had gotten 18 plus 8 plus 2. 28, so 14? Yeah. Does anybody hit it with necrotic damage?
Group Discussion 01:05:22 No, not yet. Nobody's really done spells at it, so there's not been a lot of elemental damage. Are you wanting to know if that was stuck to you? Yeah, I was curious. We'll see. I'm going to be able to, assuming I hit...
Group Discussion 01:05:39 I'm going to use my movement. Wait. I have a going. Yeah. Now this has been a long time. That was its turn. It did all that stuff. Yeah, I know, but I think last time I was supposed to go before it. No, you go before Travis. We're just top of the order. You're technically with 16, but I look down and D&D Beyond is at negative 1.
Group Discussion 01:06:01 Oh. And so, like, you were at the bottom, I was like, oh shit, you should have gone. Gotcha. So you should have gone ahead of that turn. You just spot filled in, because I got this. Gotcha, okay. Alright, that makes sense.
Group Discussion 01:06:11 So now that's the end of the third round. Sorry, end of the second round. This is top of three. Gotcha. So everybody's done it twice. That makes sense. Just make an attack with advantage. You got a 19, so there's a crit. Second one with advantage. 18, crit hits. Wait. This is where you made the rule. That's your fey thing? 18s and 19s are crits? I'm going to action search. Oh.
Group Discussion 01:06:41 Oh, 16. That's okay. That'll be a hit because it's 26. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So two crits hit. Another 15. So four hits. Two of which are crits? Two crits and then two hits. And then hasted action. Another attack. Crazy.
Group Discussion 01:06:59 Two threes, it's a miss. But the next one will have advantage from outside of... So two crits and two regulars? You'll do enough damage that, with the first one being a crit, that you don't have to discount any damage under 20. Okay, because it's just already starting. Alright, first one...
Group Discussion 01:07:30 Plus 11 is 17, plus 7 is 24, plus a d6. 2, so 26 on the first regular hit. Second regular hit. Regular hit 26. Yeah. 10, 16, 18, plus 7 is 25, plus 5 is 30. So 26 and 30. Yeah. Here, d6 damage. I want a lumberjack on this tree. And then here comes the two crits. There'll be...
Group Discussion 01:07:59 I'm calling the Clear Cutter. 5, 10, 4. This is Halo. Not over. Not over.
Group Discussion 01:08:15 Eight, 18, 27, plus five is a soft one. Plus four, 29. Plus crit. I don't know, they're real soft. One, one, three. Three ones, I'm gonna re-roll all those. So six plus, oh, that's way better. Eight plus, so 20, 26, plus seven is 30, plus two is six.
Group Discussion 01:08:44 two ones i'm gonna re-roll those a one and a two so 23 so 30. can i say 33 with that 30 plus three more there you go so four hits above like the 25 zone that's pretty good what was the total damage it's all right like 100 and something 114. ridiculous it was 56 plus 30 plus 33.
Group Discussion 01:09:07 30 plus 33, so it's 63. Yeah, 63 plus 56. 56 plus 29 plus 33. Yeah. So, yeah. 86, 91, 100. 100 even. Wow. Take it. That's got to be more than that. You just said it was 56 plus 29 plus 33. 53, yeah. It's higher than 110. Yeah. Yes. Yes.
Group Discussion 01:09:32 Yikes. That would one-shot me. Don't make him mad when he's got long ears. Alright, and two of those are crits. Crazy. He'll hear every insult. Yeah, he's not letting anything go. Oh, interesting. That's the downside. Okay, after that, it's going to use two legendary actions this time instead of all three.
Group Discussion 01:09:58 That was you counting? One creature within 60 feet of it must succeed on a strength saving stroke or be restrained by burning roots for one minute. Wait, am I restrained because of those things? Yes. Okay, you got out of it? I can't be restrained. So you're both restrained, but he's upright restrained. Well, I can't be restrained. You can't be restrained either? Yes, sir.
Group Discussion 01:10:22 I'm prone and restrained. Prone and restrained. Zero movement. I made him slippery though. Which means you cannot get up. Right. Did you say strength set? Yes. Twelve. Twelve. Okay. You are restrained. Too powerful. I don't wish for strength. It's all Dennis. Okay. Leopold, it is your turn. I can still make attacks. What was the fire damage that we were going to take? 2d8. 2d8.
Group Discussion 01:10:51 Oh, did I tell you what it was? But I didn't take it because I hadn't started my turn yet. I'm just going to keep taking that because I'm restrained. Ow. I can't get up. Can't move. Restrained. This is called Inferno. It's from Doom. Sorry, it's from Killer Instinct.
Group Discussion 01:11:21 So am I going to have disadvantage on attacks because I'm restrained or prone? You would have disadvantage because you're prone, but because you're also restrained, you cannot get up from prone because you don't have any movement to spend. Like a misty step or like a... Yeah. Use your action, one of your attacks to try to attack the roots to break yourself free? No, I'm going to...
Group Discussion 01:11:49 What's restraining me? The monster itself? I'm going to use a bonus action to Misty Step. No, what about me? Same thing? Yes. Behind? Action roots come up from the ground, restraining them. Okay. Bonus action is... Sorry, bonus action, Misty Step is 30 feet? Yeah. 30 feet, yeah. Sorry, okay, so I was here, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... Are they 5 feet or 10 feet? You might be able to end up over here.
Group Discussion 01:12:17 Just a little too far. Yeah, you want to just go here? Yeah, that's fine. It's still flanking. Almost 30 feet tall. So that was the second level spell slot. That was my bonus action.
Group Discussion 01:12:40 What's your melee ring? 10 feet? 5 feet. Does this count as 5 feet? Glades. What do you mean? Would he be able to hit from this distance? 5 feet? Or does he need to be right there? No, he has to be at least halfway through the square as well. Did it look to be that you said it was the embered cloak or what was the protective...
Group Discussion 01:13:10 Of the monster? Yeah. Yeah, that doesn't, so any damage counts now. Okay, perfect. Under the damage threshold. Okay. Nice. Then I will just make two regular attacks with my Searing Saber. Oh, but I guess we'll see. Oh, it's under the threshold for all damage now, so it takes regular damage. Okay, yes. I was reading something. Still let me know if you do different damage types and everything. Yeah.
Group Discussion 01:13:37 Yeah. Okay, so... So one's a 29, and then one was a 16. So I think only one would hit. 29 hits. 1d10 plus 6. 9.
Group Discussion 01:14:03 We have five true crits and something like eight. This is a ridiculous amount. Five, okay, so it's 11, and then I do six. Has it saved spin strength?
Group Discussion 01:14:21 so 11 regular damage and then 6 fire damage it was for the root ones it was dex for all the fire damage yeah that's what I figured dex for all the attacky ones and for all the grabby ones it was strength so 2 on us and the 1 on you was strength I think everything it does is dex or strength actually yeah usually big monsters that's what it is it's either a big crowd effect or it's like a yes
Group Discussion 01:14:52 that was my turn oh shit sorry yeah after that it is its last legendary action it'll be the only thing it hasn't oh wait that would have been with advantage right because i was flanking
Group Discussion 01:15:17 Well, no, because I only rolled two dice for one attack, which I guess would have technically put... So... Nope. Okay.
Group Discussion 01:15:33 A three. Doesn't matter. That's tough. Legendary action. It'll use Deathroot Surge. It draws power from the Tree of Death and it just regains a hit point. What? The damage scale we're on is going to fly by. It's a whole other limb. Yeah, man. I'm doing ten damage at a time here. Its health is still in the red from its total damage.
Group Discussion 01:16:02 solid actually it was 11 damage yeah that's better than the fight in the fire queen where i was in like two fire damage every time wait wait we gotta make sure this counts it adds up okay sorry oh with me yes all right i'm gonna take a chance here and i'm gonna move up and uh touch it and
Group Discussion 01:16:25 Actually, you know what? I'm not going to touch it. I'm going to actually do Mass Cure Wounds. Do some helpful stuff. So I'm going to drop my form and I'm going to move right back here. And it'll be a 5th level spell. So it should be good with stuff. It should be okay, right? I'll roll it. Here. So 3d8 plus 5.
Group Discussion 01:17:01 Not great. Everybody gets 15. Nice. Because you get whatever heals he takes. That's almond for you.
Group Discussion 01:17:40 and then it's always worth it it's like it's worth it just really makes me want to your it's just like a big pill oh man bonus action i will is that spongebob mr krabs i just take pills everywhere it's like the biggest thing ever it recharged its uh reaction
Group Discussion 01:18:06 I'm going to use my bonus action to go into another wild shape. This time I'll do Earth. And I will move up into its position here. This is me. And then I'll just go right. So I was right here. I'll burrow and pop up right here.
Group Discussion 01:18:36 Love it. And that's it. Okay. That is Cyrus' turn. Alright. Here we go. I'm just gonna move in. Who's he engaged with, technically speaking? Anybody within 5 feet. Okay. I'll just get it. I'll take my two attacks.
Group Discussion 01:19:08 25. 25 hits. 21. 21 hits. 13. 13 misses? Or is that damage? Damage. Damage. And then 11 more, so 24 total. And I'll do a defensive flourish on one of them as well.
Group Discussion 01:19:38 When you hit it with damage, it'll do its reaction, but it'll do it after your turn. So just go ahead and do your thing. Where does that hit? That's it. Sorry, I thought it was just cutting off. Oh, that's fine.
Group Discussion 01:20:07 Who's restrained? Oh. I didn't realize you also got tied up. Fuck, dude. Two. Shrullen. Real poor. Ten. Ten is a failure. You are pushed to get away and fall prone. Fuck. Do I fly out of his group?
Group Discussion 01:20:34 What? He's not holding you, you're being held to the ground. Oh, the roots, the roots. Do I blast out of the roots? I just want to blast out of what? It'll be at max, if you fail, 18 fire damage, and that's 10 and 16, 19 necrotic damage. I'll prone you too. So getting prone, use your movement. Half your movement, yeah. That's why it's a bummer to also be restrained, because then you
Group Discussion 01:21:04 So did we all fly backwards? Total was... It was 19 necrotic and 18 fire. 19 necrotic and 18 fire. Uh...
Group Discussion 01:21:23 I'm going to use another absorb elements for fire. So that was 18. I don't think there's fire resistance on it. I don't think there's fire resistance. No, it was necrotic. It's like a resistance. Yeah, it was. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So you do have two spell slots in there now. Oh, yeah. What did we put in there? Fireball and like...
Group Discussion 01:21:49 maybe shields I don't know yeah revivify yeah I never learned it it's just wish it's a three but I don't because I can't escalate my spell slots it's not like it's I could roll better and better to try to look it up I can't figure out where what it was I think it was a fireball after that though it's pity's turn cool okay hold on I'm gonna use half my movement to stand by bib okay
Group Discussion 01:22:20 And then I am going to cast a 6-level Prayer of Healing. Can I borrow 3 d8s, please? So everyone's going to get healed with d8s, and everyone who... So these three homies, you can use your reaction to use a melee attack on them.
Group Discussion 01:22:41 I was hoping you got crunched. I was like, no. That would have been everybody going to 10. Okay, 10. Oh, pretty good. 22, 30, 37. 37, nice. Everybody gets 37? And then you three, you can use your reaction to attack him. With a melee.
Group Discussion 01:23:09 Only 15. Does 22 hit? 22 hits. Alright, that one makes a connection. That's 15 plus 7. Am I allowed to choose myself within those 5? If you want to. And then a d6, hang on. 15 plus 7 is 22 plus another 2 is 24 hit total. 4 to hit? No, that's just total damage.
Group Discussion 01:23:44 Yeah, I think that's me. There's not much bonus or movement that I would really want. Okay, other people rolling to hit two? I used my reaction. Damn, okay. After that, it is the Cinder's turn. We got one hit. Paladin, you are restrained, so it's going to take both of its attacks on you. I'm also prone.
Group Discussion 01:24:12 which you are far away. So there's the advantage, and I rolled the six on the recharge, so it, as a, oh, that's a legendary. Never mind, that's not one. It did get its healing thing back on the recharge. So it healed another 40 points? No, it has the ability to do it again when it has a legendary action. It's not a momentary action. You've got to kill it before it takes another legendary action. That is a punch to hit. Pretty simple. First one.
Group Discussion 01:24:42 Like a bunch over 26? It is 16 plus 12, 48. And the second one is 19 plus 12. Both hit. Those are good. Those are good hits. Those do connect.
Group Discussion 01:24:59 You take 38 points of slashing damage plus 8 necrotic and 29 slashing plus 12 necrotic. I'm down. Down. That was like 67. Shit. So close. Even with those heals. It's a good thing that you did not promise your body to somebody when you died.
Group Discussion 01:25:23 Well, is that going down, or just like... I'm not dead. You have to be dead, dead, but... He's not dead yet, but... You ain't getting it back when you die. Oh. It has, on a part of its attack, this is the actual only thing that can come up. Blackfire Smite, it's just been doing the necrotic damage in every attack. If a target was reduced to zero HP by a melee attack, it automatically has a failed death spawning throw. So you start with one failure, zero successes. Epic. I hate not being able to see...
Group Discussion 01:25:53 They make sure you're ordered. I like just having a little... Do we write it down real quick? Or a pad of paper. Just keeping your memory. Just remember it, dude. This is a wild... Yeah, this is like...
Group Discussion 01:26:11 We're almost back to the top of the order. It is at the bottom of the order. So it would be you and the main. Leopold, Zariel, Cyrus, Cletus, Big Boss, Guardian. And then those were its two attacks. It has the bonus action thing. It is going to bonus action
Group Discussion 01:26:42 Smolder and Grasp. It'll grab one creature within 10 feet. It's gonna grab Leopold. Did it let me go? You were grabbed by something else. Give me a strength saving throw. Strength saving throw. Roll this one so maybe that'll be a little better. 13. You are grappled and you take up the start.
Group Discussion 01:27:10 That is nine fire damage, and you will take another 3d6 at the start of your turn. Okay. So the nine is halved because I still have a resistance. Perfect. So that would be four, or would that round up to five? Round down. Four. Top of the round is just call it. Don't fail. Two fails. Shit. Fuck.
Group Discussion 01:27:40 Okay. Do you have any healing now? Not like magic-wise, but if I can get to him restrained. At the end of Kaladin's turn, it's going to do Cinder Burst. Everybody give me a constitution saving throw. You still make it when you're unconscious.
Group Discussion 01:28:09 Which is constitution saving throw, okay. 18, no, 19. I'm gonna say you take no damage. Jesus, fucking hell, these dice blow. What is it, con save? Con save. 14. 11. 16. Failure.
Group Discussion 01:28:39 14, I assume, fails. Yeah. 22 points of necrotic fire damage. If you were resistant to fire, that was only half of it. So 23, you said, fire? It is, no. It is 24 necrotic, and it is 5, 8 fire.
Group Discussion 01:29:09 Four. Damn. Jesus. An eight fire. Yikes. So does that kill you then? No. Because you took damage? No. I gave it the rule that since he passed, he takes zero. And Leopold, it is your turn.
Group Discussion 01:29:33 Um, restrained, right? So that means I can't move. You are in its grasp. So you are ten or so feet off the ground at the bottom of its grasp. Zero movement unless you break out, but you can attack it. Normally, if there were multiple monsters here, you attack other things with disadvantage. Normal on it, though. Got it. Alright. Okay, so in Kaladin, you're like down on the ground. Down on the ground. So I can't really... Um...
Group Discussion 01:30:06 Okay. I will use a bonus action to cast Branding Smite at the fourth level. So that'll be an extra 46 of radiant if I do make contact. And then I will just
Group Discussion 01:30:34 with a straight roll. This is pretty much the end of the fight, I think. It's pretty low. Oh, nat 20. On attack? Yeah. And I have Branding Smite. So will that double the Branding Smite? Doubles everything. Oh, fuck yeah. Okay, so then that's a 2d10. That's a d100.
Group Discussion 01:31:05 so uh okay so 10 13 and then plus 12 so 25 and then fire damage doesn't count but the branding smite was a 4d6 because i did it the fourth level so that would make it i think yeah it was a 4d6 that would be an 8d6 yeah
Group Discussion 01:31:35 Eight, ten, twelve, eighteen, nineteen damage.
Group Discussion 01:32:04 on the extra branding. So my 19, uh, radiant. Okay. So that was one of my strikes and then for the other one, let's see what that comes out to be.
Group Discussion 01:32:34 Uh, 23 to hit? 23 hits. Nice. So then that's just a regular d10. Ooh, 10. Nice. And then, uh, so 16 damage.
Group Discussion 01:32:52 Let's go! That was another 16 damage. And that's my turn. It's looking pretty hurt. It's looking very hurt. Zario, it's your turn. I'm going to burrow over to Kaladin. I'm going to cast
Group Discussion 01:33:19 What are you doing, Jesse? It's just a mask. It's just a cure wounds at this level.
Group Discussion 01:33:45 10, let's see, 20, 30, 38. 38? Plus 5, so 43. 43. Yeah, 43. Oh, okay. That's solid. And then this is mine, and the rest of them are yours. This is mine. You needed that.
Group Discussion 01:34:13 And then, bonus action, I had to drop my form to cast, so it's just me over there. And then... Sorry.
Group Discussion 01:34:33 Well, you'd be down anyway, but... Well, I'm still technically grappled, I guess. The roots are still alive. Cheers. Let me just check real quick, see if I have any bump sections. Let's see. I'm going to use my Adrenaline Rush ability.
Group Discussion 01:34:56 Where I can dash as a bonus action up to four times for a long rest, and I gain four temporary hit points when I do so. So I'll just go... There. Just gonna circle him? Yeah, just to give advantage. And then I'll give... I'm already at full health, though, so... Because I've been wild-shaped the whole time.
Group Discussion 01:35:19 Oh no. That was a clutch thing to be able to just like boom.
Group Discussion 01:35:35 I'm going to heal all the time anyway, so why not? Every time you heal, it does that? Every time you target an ally, they get to attack. So spells or healing is just going to automatically do that. Especially if it's a group heal. Super handy. I'm just waiting until everyone's circled down. Mask Cure Wounds and just drop that. We'll do a 4th level Cerebral.
Group Discussion 01:36:08 What level of drift did you get to when you got fast? 15, 16, 21, I think it was 10. 10 or 5, plus 6. And it's a bit low spot. And then I'll just forge something here. What are you multi-classing in, Claire?
Group Discussion 01:36:29 You guys put a lot of heals out. And more are about to come. Just like these trees. Bring it back. Cyrus, how do you want to finish? Oh, fuck!
Group Discussion 01:36:59 That's a fun one. He comes. He puts it out. I'm trying to think logistically. I want to slice it in half from the top. Have your anime moment. You can do however you want, this is fine. I'm fucking leaping up, bouncing off somebody's shoulder.
Group Discussion 01:37:30 Both hands into the top, right into its chest. I wanna see how many friggin' rings it has. Oh, it's a sketch of two. It's a baby. I'm gonna just slide down the front of it. Like Iron Man superhero. All the way through it, you see it doesn't split right away, but you have this light in like, when you can see the sun rays coming out of it and it's getting more and more intense.
Group Discussion 01:37:55 And you hear it just like, as the whole thing splits and explodes. As part of its dying, it ignites and explodes. And so you see Cyrus still has this monstrous explosion. And then everybody except Cyrus needs to give me a dexterity saving throw. Oh my god. As it explodes and 2d6 fire damage. I guess I'm still awake. I should be able to survive. 2d6 fire damage.
Group Discussion 01:38:22 I died. Nat 20! 18? 18 success. 10? It was too deep? Oh, I guess you'll roll it. Oh, you passed. Oh, so I take no damage? No damage. Oh. You said it was 5? What? What was the damage? 10. That was the first dex save I passed that entire fight. You're prone forever at that point.
Group Discussion 01:38:57 There's nothing left of this creature. It is split in half, but it's all still there. You see the fire is gone. The fire exploded like it was barely being contained by the form. You now have this like fungus riddled husk of like wood, shavings, branches, everything kind of held together.
Group Discussion 01:39:25 He looks like a lopsided deviled egg, kind of carved out. Just carved in the middle. Oh, so it's hollow in the middle. This one is yours? No. Oh, I see nothing is yours. No, these are bigger. I have normal sized ones. That's what I heard.
Group Discussion 01:39:42 So it's completely hollow in the center? The card is like a little space of where the fire was being contained. So mostly filled in timber material and a space of hollows. Nothing of value on the creature. Its weapons were like a very large tree trunk sharpened on one edge and like a piece of wood that was like a root system that was like carved into an axe. Like all blunt, slashing, nothing fancy.
Group Discussion 01:40:08 I want to really begrudgingly drag that big tree axe behind me forever now. Cloudbuster sword style. I'm not proficient at it either. Can I splinter off some of the wood? Yeah, you can add cinder husk. Cinder husk. Make some tamales.
Group Discussion 01:40:49 So who's still pretty low? You're still pretty low, right? I'm at 38. Yeah, I'll use a third level gear wounds. I just want to see what happens. So that's 68 plus 5. So 11 plus 9, that's 20. 20 plus 6, 26. I don't know that.
Group Discussion 01:41:17 31 plus 5, so 36 damage. Sorry, 36. And that was a third level spell. Yeah. You heal nothing. Oh! Cool, cool, cool. Ew, the tree's still there. That wasn't the tree we killed. The tree of death amidst a necrotic aura. I knew that. I just wanted to see what happened. I thought it was going to be, like, resistant or something. You thought it was half. I thought it was half. It's nothing. No, potions have interesting mechanics as well. Well, fuck.
Group Discussion 01:41:46 Don't do that, guys. It looked like I just stood here and pointed. I did cast a spell and nothing happened. You saw that, but it looks like it gets sluggish and dies out in the air. He releases this aura which just like floats and then withers and crumples and kind of turns to dust before it makes it to you. I promise this never happens. These are weak. This never happens to me, I promise.
Group Discussion 01:42:14 You gotta learn from the trees. You are a druid and all. Yeah. Trees become hard. Y'all know trees come hard. Trees come hard right here. That tree guy came hard at us the right way. That was nuts. Well. So I just belly flopped, like, dive into the tree. No, I'm just kidding.
Group Discussion 01:42:44 I think I'll just start taking a short rest. Yeah. I think a nice little break would be in order. You sit down and you see the cradle in the little group system on the far corner, far wall. It's like calling to you. All of you, anybody who has ingested the fluid, so Zariel, Leopold, and Kaladin, if you haven't drank it yet, so I believe that's you and you.
Group Discussion 01:43:14 um you don't feel a pull but if you have you it's it's like it's safety it's healing it's wellness is what you're supposed to do totally believe it go go inspect that totally that's a natural positive feeling and you start to walk close as you get within 10 feet of it
Group Discussion 01:43:38 Just a naked orc Dick dangling in the wind four beings so you have four skin
Group Discussion 01:44:07 I love this, I love this. Alright. Yeah, go ahead and continue to move forward. Can I make some sort of like... It starts to glow when you get five. Can I do any sort of investigation? Or sense it out arcane-wise? Do you touch it to any extent? Or are you all doing it at a range? Well, I mean, now you said I was within ten, now I'm within five on melee, but...
Group Discussion 01:44:34 Do I feel anything that still feels negative or is it still feeling? Nothing negative from this spot right here. Let's touch it. Overarching. Everything feels evil. I mean, there is a portal to the nine hells burning at the base of this tree below you guys. Yeah. This is something else that just got impacted by that. Yeah.
Group Discussion 01:44:55 Go ahead and just continue to move forward and interact with it. As soon as you touch it, you guys, Kaladin doesn't remember doing it, but you just have like this whisper in your ears that gets so loud that everything kind of tunes out and you forget what happened, but everybody sees Kaladin get in the cradle and he's encompassed in a golden amber that you see draws down the root system and he disappears.
Group Discussion 01:45:25 native dive in after him oh you go to dive but the instinct is that and you think you're doing that everybody watches like Zorro runs up and as soon as he like makes contact he calms down he gets in the cradle he gets covered with amber and then he disappears I'm coming for you oh so pleasant on a warm blanket I'll turn to Cletus and Sarah oh I think I'll be on my way but before I do I'll hand you the stones of far speech that I have
Group Discussion 01:45:55 that i got i think out of the magic item is not everybody going oh we're all going he just doesn't know what he's going to i don't think i have any extra do i yeah you gotta you gotta smile with it oh i thought i drank that if you drink it you are under this effect
Group Discussion 01:46:14 He... I think I just vialed it. You collected a vial. Yeah. Oh. Everybody has a way to get into this ritual. He's got one in his pocket, too. Yeah. You just don't have the draw if you haven't already ingested it. Yeah, so I'll hand one stone. Pop a top again. Swig. Oh, I guess you're just coming with. The warmth, the safety. Yeah. Again, in that cocoon. One by one, you get cocooned, covered. Oh, my God.
Group Discussion 01:46:44 and then disappear.
Group Discussion 01:46:47 And we'll take our break as we are describing the very first thing that happens in the Feywild is a group of beings are hearing clutter above them as if they've been found out. They are in hushed tones talking and behind them the tree that they're standing next to produces a one foot by three foot amber egg containing the form of a
Group Discussion 01:47:15 unconscious station stasis caledon and the alternative look in surprise what kind of room are they in or are they just in a natural it's like a enclosed dark uh like grove space with a tree at the basement how long would you see the group's been bumping around here we'll get there okay imagine hiding here for four seconds pops up
Group Discussion 01:47:45 I feel like you just don't see it advertised nearly as much because Coors Light has their whole cold as the rock East deal. Yeah. And like Banquet, they don't really. It's the Banquet beer. Yeah, I guess that's their little. It tastes as cold as the rock East. Yeah, it's the Banquet beer. This one just got the cold.
Group Discussion 01:48:19 It's at least Butte cold. It's the banquet, yeah. Have you seen some of those old cans? They're like, they were like literally food cans. Yeah. And they would, you'd have to use a can opener to open your beer. Correct, correct. Yeah. And they would punch two holes. Yeah. That smooth draw. Uh-huh. Dude, it's insane. I've been like out backpacking where people just dump a whole bunch of garbage and you'll find a whole bunch of old. You'll find some really old things. Beers. Yeah. Like a bunch of cans like that. Yeah.
Group Discussion 01:48:50 Yeah. Yeah. It's a little, like, old cowboy. It's just like, fuck it. Yeah, you're going to get in the zone. Get zoned out here. Oh, did it come to Portland? Yeah. Cool. Yeah.
Group Discussion 01:49:19 This is going to be good. Dude, what is with that guy?
Group Discussion 01:49:44 Oh my God. Have you seen the video of the old guy who talked like that in the news? He like owns this like fucking swimming pond. Yeah. Mr. Herbert. Yes. And he's like been sued and shit. And he's like, I don't know. I think the kids just kind of like it. It's like the most absurd.
Group Discussion 01:50:10 What did he talk like, John? What's the name? I can't do a Herbert. Oh, the Herbert. Herbert the pervert, right. Yeah, he's got the whistle. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Group Discussion 01:50:32 The sheriff even says he wants to shut it down, but the owner, Charles Womack, says he's not going anywhere. I'm just trying to help these high school kids and college kids because they ain't got no money.
Group Discussion 01:50:56 Yeah, he's just like, I always like to have it open for all the kids hanging out. Oh, yeah. That's giving me ideas. One of these days, if I play a one shot, I'm going to have to go with that voice.
Group Discussion 01:51:15 Could you imagine doing a one-shot in that whole voice? Oh, my gosh. That was going to be the worst. Oh, damn, dude. I would have fucking loved that. That would have been hilarious. It just would have been really hard and annoying. There's some words where it works and some it doesn't. You have to practice it, yeah. Because this is my original thing. I was going to be the young version of that voice. So, like, have that going. The young Herbert the pervert. Impossible. Just the whistle.
Group Discussion 01:51:43 That's good. I haven't seen that video in a long time. That's good. Oh yeah. He was into that shit dude.
Group Discussion 01:52:10 He's like, with his overalls, he's like... Yeah. Jesus Christ. Could you imagine, though, playing a character that whole, like, seriously all the way through like that? You would have to commit hardcore to that. Jesse was going to do that kind of voice.
Group Discussion 01:52:46 He said yes. Every time he talks, Jonathan was like this. Your British guy. Oh, yeah. Bracket. Bracket. That's fucking great. That was a good character. Yeah, that was that character. First, you know. Oh, first fake one. First real one, yeah. Your dragonborn was the first, first one.
Group Discussion 01:53:17 Bashir or something, Picard, I don't remember the name. I'm just down, and then Rank Duncan. Rank Duncan. Okay, we ready? Yeah, I think so. What do we decide for equipment for? Oh yeah. Because I don't have any like, starting equipment to start with, and then something in a moment.
Group Discussion 01:53:49 Yeah, I don't even think I gave him equipment. It'll be fine. Get there. Where the hell do I find focus points? Anybody, any monks around here? Uh, yeah. I think you have, like, three or four, maybe, right now. I don't know how many. Nine! Oh, wow, a lot more. Yeah.
Group Discussion 01:54:18 Three. Monks are short rest characters. Yeah. Before we do anything new, so in the Cindered Cradle, everybody has gone through but Leopold. Leopold, as you're walking towards the cradle, you feel the draw. You hesitate.
Group Discussion 01:54:44 You look over your shoulder and you see Bone Crusher standing there between you and this creature looking at you, looking back at its corpse. Looking at you, looking back at its corpse. Yeah, so I'm like instinctively pulled to the portal and I just kind of like pause. Stop mid-step. It's like something is more overpowering than the draw of that portal. And I kind of turn back to Bone Crusher and I feel like we're like communicating on the same wavelength. Like there's...
Group Discussion 01:55:13 some unspoken words there and I look over to this fallen creature which I just kind of chiseled some wood chunks off of and I take them out of my pack and I just crush them into dust and at my feet I say, stand and the monster
Group Discussion 01:55:34 kind of presumably takes a form of what it looked like I don't know what would you describe it as like rising out of it is a smaller just a large version of that creature sort of in a spectral form okay however you imagine Leopold's magic looks color wise yeah gives an aura of that kind of tinted to your magic
Group Discussion 01:56:01 Yeah, I would say it kind of reflects the deep violet of my visor. You kind of see, like, emanating from the suit of armor. It's kind of like a dark, kind of like neon violet aura. Does that make sense? And we already talked about what it does in the basic, but as far as special abilities, do you want it to be defensive or offensive? Defensive.
Group Discussion 01:56:31 I'll do offensive. Okay. And then I've got to figure out a way to override my... Oh yeah, there it is. Okay. Is this taking place with Bonecrusher? So you just see both of them stand together. Okay. It'll do...
Group Discussion 01:57:01 you'll have a version of its reap action. When it would take damage, it would swing out and attack all of you. Okay. You'll get a version of that. Oh, interesting. Excellent. Okay. Okay. So you have standing before you, did you do the same thing to Bonecrusher? Yeah, I think you'll look over, I'll look over and kind of take in the sights
Group Discussion 01:57:31 and turn the bone crusher suit of armor and just kind of like tap him on the shoulder and from the suit of armor just peel off a shadow copy and like drop him down next to the other monster and just like with the connection that we have being strong enough I can almost fragment bone crusher's soul a little bit kind of split it in two so there's like a shadow bone crusher
Group Discussion 01:58:02 Like realizing this was a vision that I saw or like kind of a, what I thought was maybe a hallucination. So I think we'd all seen the shadow running around before. Yeah. And then you get into the cradle and your shadows vanish. And then you were teleported to the Fae.
Group Discussion 01:58:26 and so where we start it is um it had been about midday do you guys want a refresher on these characters like the basis we talked about it earlier yes please yeah yeah okay um the feywild
Group Discussion 01:58:47 A long time ago. This was when the war on the continent of Redivir had been at its most peak and most dangerous. The entire inhabitants of the Feywild came together in the normal Fey fashion. Every living creature came to a meeting and voted on that ultimately the Fey realm as a reflection of the material plane could not survive if the continent were to be destroyed.
Group Discussion 01:59:17 they would, in the short term, sacrifice their magic in a deal with the elder god Jeya. She is the goddess of creation. That they would give their power and influence to her to direct to save the planet in a certain way. On the deal that eventually a being in...
Group Discussion 01:59:41 the Fae realm would be born of nobility of prominence and could dawn what is called the Eternal Weave. It is the crown of the High Fae Lord who rules the individual Fae court beings as well, just like the High King.
Group Discussion 01:59:59 then they were slowly drained at first. There was a gradual change where the Feywet realm went from being this vibrant, infinitely magical place to having streaks and waves of wasteland and desert and just nothing surviving, as it has been robbed of magic and any ability to live.
Group Discussion 02:00:21 But something changed recently. A group known as the Guardians of the Wild, a very secret organization that were passed down the knowledge from the original deal, knowing that there's going to be somebody that comes along that they need to get the crown on, would be born.
Group Discussion 02:00:38 And so they've kind of been waiting in passive. Most recently, a scion of the Fae realm, if she was in a court that existed, she would be just somebody of importance. You can see kind of the future was born, named Fae Lara. And she foresaw that this person was coming. And she might have been very fair and pleasant and feminine,
Group Discussion 02:01:04 in a normal world but she has been living in a very battle-ridden state fighting the sort of gangs and bandit groups that pop up in the wastelands of the Fae that then try to rob all of the materials and fruits and foods and stuff from the very lush areas of the Fae and so she's been fighting so she always sort of walks around in a suit of elven sort of plate mail
Group Discussion 02:01:27 Half of her head is shaven and like an undercut the other half is like chopped at the shoulder flop backwards She's got some scars on her face still very beautiful, but she is a fighter not a caster she set out looking for certain individuals and
Group Discussion 02:01:44 who could aid in basically guarding this being when they were teleported. The job is to take this person from point A, which is their tree of life, that is where Yorgas' tree of death was, and to take them to the tree of death in the Faerun, which is the tree of life.
Group Discussion 02:02:04 In the material plane. In doing so. In passing through the fey wild. In this very old. Archaic path. Follow the trail through the woods and everything. These beings would be infused. With the fey. And when they were reborn. They are arch fey capable of donning. A fey wild crown. That is all the information you have. So this is like the secret organization. That only knows. That they need to be able to.
Group Discussion 02:02:32 get somebody from point A to point B was sort of sitting and waiting and they've been activated by one by one. So in this room, Fae Laura is like sitting on a stump talking to all of you. She's got like a Stein of ale in one hand and their sword always sits in her waist, but it's so long that she holds it flat so that the sword doesn't drag behind her. She sits with that always level the Steiner one hand and she's just bullshitting with the group. Um,
Group Discussion 02:03:00 waiting. You've been gathered to wait for this to happen. In this moment, you hear this sound of a bunch of howls above you. You are in this sort of sunken grove that has a secret entrance underneath like a big patch of mushrooms. It's guarded by a talking centipede with an eyepatch. And it sort of like keeps people from going through, but you hear this loud noise of howling, and you hear that guy go, oh, fuck! And he starts like, you hear like clash of swords from his
Group Discussion 02:03:32 And you guys are raised to attention. First one to sort of look up, it'll be left to right, is your character. Who do they see sort of look up and how do you address the situation?
Group Discussion 02:03:47 You see a pig man with the face of a pig out of human hands. He's like brown with floppy ears. He's chubby in an athletic way, like a lineman, basically. And we've just been waiting here for hours while he's taking a nap.
Group Discussion 02:04:17 next to him I'm wearing green clothes like Robin Hood is okay dressed like Robin Hood hey no hat um Brent we get a name or do we get that later Barrow Barrow yeah that's good thanks um last name just first name it's like Cher oh okay I thought you were just just one name uh
Group Discussion 02:04:46 Next to him is a large eagle, humanoid creature named Karak. And I'm pretty sure I probably would have just been sitting there sort of down late and still been surprised that something showed up. He's like zoning out. I'm just like, what? Next to him, you guys are just letting us dump around a fire.
Group Discussion 02:05:14 um the fire is purple and you're all just around it bullshitting because you've been waiting like days you've all been filtering at different paces um and at this point you um you all explain you all know who's attacking but as it happens what does your character look like do and say yeah uh i think so alabaster would have been actually more at attention just kind of like scanning always vigilant
Group Discussion 02:05:43 And when this comes down the pipe, he steps forward and what you see is a luxadon, an elephant character who is massive, like, you know, 15, 16 feet tall, like standing on his two legs. Whatever, like a bull elephant, like the height of a bull elephant standing on top of his two legs. Can you imagine that? Bipedal? Yeah, bipedal. Elephant character, not with just one tusk, or sorry, trunk, but three.
Group Discussion 02:06:13 So kind of like three coming down and two massive curling tusks and then big floppy Dumbo ears. And I'm in platinum plate, just the most reflective, right?
Group Discussion 02:06:30 plate metal you see with emboldened with gems like rubies, sapphires, different gems. And I'm resting my hands on a ginormous great sword that is also sheathed and like platinum and diamond. And I have these chains that wrap from my like shoulders to my ears and like gold bracelets on the trunks, just like fully decked out. Very cool.
Group Discussion 02:06:57 And I catch this noise. I've been waiting for it. And I go, oh, you two oafs. You're a fly on my hide. Get up. Be ready.
Group Discussion 02:07:19 uh so on the ground next to you you see like a propped up vertical in appearingly empty big turtle shell with like a draped robe over him um i i'm assuming the gold light from this amber is just going crazy reflective off you it's like oh yeah i'm a disco ball for sure like
Group Discussion 02:07:40 Fuck, dude, it's way too early. What the fuck? And that's Tortimus Staggerfin. Tortimus Staggerfin. What does Tortimus look like? Oh, yeah. Well, pretty standard. Young tortoise. He's got, like, a wispy. He's trying to grow out his nice stache, but it's, like, not looking awesome yet. He's, like, crackly green-brown scales.
Group Discussion 02:08:09 Nice. And last but not least. Alright, so it's basically like Dobby from Harry Potter. His little, like, little, like, very scared of everything.
Group Discussion 02:08:22 He's like, oh, what the fuck? And I'm going to go hide under the turtle shell. In the shell. Yeah, and I'll go, ugh, and I thought I escaped the circus. And your name is? It's Gooch the Third. Gooch the Third. That's perfect. So you look like Bobby. Yeah, I just basically look like Bobby. Gooch the Third.
Group Discussion 02:08:46 That's good. He's got that little diaper thing. That's all he's got. A loincloth. It's not free yet. You guys are there and then you hear this noise above you of like somebody is attacking. The scene's handled right now. Randall definitely has it for a bit. But you guys talking right now then...
Group Discussion 02:09:16 see that the tree behind you starts glowing. This amber light comes from like the canopy, like it's been delivered via the air invisibly and an amber light glows all the way to the bottom to the cradle and popping out is a,
Group Discussion 02:09:32 Amber crystal of Kaladin's character, perfectly frozen in stasis, but all features. You can see he's like a full-sized person in there. And you guys know that part of your ritual is that you take the shrinking water and you dump it on them. And so who walks up and grabs Kaladin? This is the being. This is the guy you've been waiting for. Not me.
Group Discussion 02:09:56 Way too important for me, dude. I'm looking with my sword abreast. I haven't drank enough for this yet. It might not be him. What if it's just some guy that came through? Odds are this is a trick. This guy's not even here. Have some respect. We have a mission to do. This is the chosen one. Careful with that shrink. We've been waiting for this. Where did Felora find you? Then fucking grab it, dude. I don't know.
Group Discussion 02:10:24 She's standing there and she goes, Will somebody fucking grab it? I'll just... I'll just walk up and just... Just, like... Just with that, like, fucking disgust. Finally dump whatever this is. It's like kind of shooting this at you guys. It's like...
Group Discussion 02:10:46 like giant amber crystal shrinks down to a like one foot by like one and a half foot but like spheroid egg shape um that you can hold but it's kind of burdensome i'll walk up you're so large that it's not probably even put it on your belt but normal size beans this is like a backpack essentially it was barrel i'll walk out you're a stout young man here and i'll throw it at you
Group Discussion 02:11:14 Okay. Um, there's a guy in here. It's just a little, like, action-bigger size. Just a calendar. All right, keep him warm. We gotta hash him. Um, and she's like, this is, this is him. We've conversed about this. This is the guy. Why are you guys so, ugh? She's like, I understand. So what? Finish your sentence. Yes. I'm pissing you off. You're right. We deserve it. We're terrible. Get it out. You can't harbor those emotions. She's like,
Group Discussion 02:11:46 I will go up there to help address whatever this is. And she's like, those fucking swine. I swear to God. And she's like, you know. What the fuck did you just say? It's them. That's like actually not chill at all. You should take that back. She called me swine, dude. All right, all right. Break it up. No, they're swine. And she goes, it's Sir Loin Brock and Belly.
Group Discussion 02:12:12 the three brothers who own the banditry camp out in the waste. Yes, they fucking suck. We all know it. She's like, and Randall's only so good, but they have a pack of wolves that kind of do their thing with them. It's very rudimentary. And she starts walking, but she's like, in seven days flat, you need to be a
Group Discussion 02:12:42 I will meet you there. Try to clear the path best I can. We can do it. The tree is much smaller, but it glows. It's like a holy tree in the Feywild. The other one is...
Group Discussion 02:12:57 The Feywild is still a reflection of, I don't have a map for this one, of Averius. So it's still the same general continent shape. So you are in the far north, and it is to the south and east. I don't know about peninsula. Diagonally. Yeah. And that's where the Tree of Life is in Averius. All right, man. You heard Feylora. We've been running drills for this. I think we can do it. Motherfucker, we have a turtle.
Group Discussion 02:13:30 and the glow descends out of the tree, and a crystal popping out of who the second person was to go through, which I believe was Zorro. There is a deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep
Group Discussion 02:13:57 See, I told you it was a trick. The first one has to be a trick. The orb quickly rolls out of the way as another pulls it in, and the other orb that forms kind of pushes the first one out. So one just hits the ground, rolls a little bit, and another one pops up of the third person who came through, which was Cyrus. Of like an emo-looking half-elf with like a choker and a sword. This is me. I like this guy.
Group Discussion 02:14:26 I don't know why. The other one of Zariel is on the ground. I like that guy. This guy seems chill. Oh, dude, can I trade you guys? There's no way. This guy's way too in touch with his emotions. This guy looks pensive. A giant cowman comes through, rolls through, pops in the tree. Alabaster, you're out.
Group Discussion 02:14:48 well you know in the prophecy they do speak of deep seated magic from the other plane so I do believe it is our mission you've already said that like 13 times I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't
Group Discussion 02:15:20 you know that's not a man you know in the meta these are living beings who are in stasis they cannot protect themselves if they die in this form or like broken or crushed they're done and so you have the one person who followed some others have been claimed and two that are on the ground now one in the tree uh well what do you guys say should we just leave and take this one guy i'm gonna take that suit of armor looks pretty cool two trips
Group Discussion 02:15:49 You shrink all of them so they all go to, like, backpack time. Uh-uh. Okay, let's give her a call, see if we can double our timeline. We'll go once, come back for the rest. Well, let's wait up for the rest. There could be, like, ten more. So, if I could give you two...
Group Discussion 02:16:07 I'm sure I could carry more than... They're not heavy. They're just, like, awkward in that, like, you have something on your body that you have to account for. I'd carry a few. Yeah.
Group Discussion 02:16:23 Pull one in. Come back out. It's like in your chest. I'm like, my head's a little awkward. It's like it's locked into a big chunk of my chest. There's a problem on top of your shoulder. It's so nerve-entrapping. My head's out my arm hole. This is just going to have to do. This isn't ideal. And starting now, you know that it is like a nine to ten day trip.
Group Discussion 02:16:52 You have to get there in less time than, in theory, it can allow for. Because if you don't, the trees will die, and the Feywild is doomed. Good thing we got all this heavy shit to carry. All right, listen up. We do have a mission to do. We're going to die if we don't complete our mission. I want to put that in perspective. That means you squished.
Group Discussion 02:17:17 Let's go. And I'm just going to start trudging off down the path. Why is only he the one that's going to die? I'm the only one that's going to die. You guys are going to help me out. I'll be looking for you, Gooch. What? It's going to be you. I'm sorry, Gooch. There's no way it's not you first. My anxiety is already so high. I don't need this. You guys... Wait, so you're just like a goblin, dude? Yeah, I think technically I'm just a halfling.
Group Discussion 02:17:46 Just a tiny little laugh. Oh, God. Okay. I'm glad one of us is taking this. You guys start going. A little bit of hustle on your step at the back of this grove, and you're running, and you see some, like, wolves circling around getting beat up by Randall and Valara.
Group Discussion 02:18:06 There are three larger boar shapes, but you can't make them out at this distance, who seem to be fighting from afar. You guys run the other way, because you know that's not the way you're supposed to do it. It's just fine. So you're running through this patch of lush area of the Fae. Huge mushrooms, they're bioluminescent, everything is very magical and beautiful, but you know that you're going to cross through a deserted area eventually, and you're going to keep passing through varying places.
Group Discussion 02:18:34 As you guys go, you follow a very specific path. So you can't deviate too much because if you don't, you're worried that the prophecy won't come true. So the first thing is going to take you through a town. But you guys have about a half day's travel before you get there.
Group Discussion 02:18:51 So who wants to lead this part of the expedition? We just slow turn to the elephant. I was going to say, I just strode off down the trail. I don't even know if I was going to wait for these guys.
Group Discussion 02:19:06 Slow down, man. I'm just like... Someone push me down this hill, I pump him. I'll roll down. It's way more efficient. I have a hard time believing the prophecy meant you four idiots. I speed roll past you. Yeah, I deserve it. But I will pause and...
Group Discussion 02:19:35 I'll slow down just enough to keep the group marching in a good pace. Okay. Give me a survival check as you leave the party on the first leg of the journey. All right. So late.
Group Discussion 02:20:00 Well, I guess if I, oh, shit, I should just roll that in person. What's this A here? That just means I have advantage for some reason? Oh, is that like a class? Oh, yeah, I guess so, even though I'm not built in wisdom at all. As you were leaving, this is super important, you guys passed the armory. Yes! Dude, I was on a mission. You all can pick out an armor of your choice.
Group Discussion 02:20:30 With the balance of you get one more powerful item and then a standard item. So giving yourself like true adamantine plate means that your melee weapon or whatever you want to use is going to be like a normal maybe just like silvered weapon. So like magic by definition but not extra damage. Or if you want something that does a little bit more damage as a weapon you just take like basic armor and stuff. I can't wear armor.
Group Discussion 02:20:59 So you can get whatever cooler item you want with that. Yeah, I'd probably just take whatever sword option is. Well, you could say I want normal armor and I want a sword and a ring that does something and let me know. We'll arrange it for the next session because this will probably be a three to four session thing. Probably just three. But that'll be how it goes. So who wants what? I guess I would want a more powerful...
Group Discussion 02:21:28 one-handed, like, longsword. Any, like, elemental affinities or anything like that? No, I am doing the, like, wild surge stuff, so there could be some sort of flavor with that. Okay, so barbarian. Yeah. And then a shield. That could be basic. Just a normal shield. Yeah.
Group Discussion 02:21:57 And you can't wear armor as barbarian. Perfect. Barrow. What's your sword? Nature Revives. Are you adding them, or are you trying them out? Nature Revives, you said? I said Nature Revives. Nice.
Group Discussion 02:22:17 My tail is just kind of like... The armor and basic shield that you want to your character, and then long sword, it'll be a plus one weapon. And then on your first attack, we'll decide what it does, and we'll just build it out in session, and then I'll make an item for it.
Group Discussion 02:22:46 Okay, so basic shield and then a plus one long. Yeah, so when you're rolling your damage, plus one to attack and damage. Who's next? Let's see, so it's like one magic item and then only one regular item? Or like one much less, less magic item.
Group Discussion 02:23:07 So if I, like, I don't know if it's regular, like, plate mail or half plate. Is that regular item? Yeah, that'd be normal. Okay. Adamantine is, like, magic and lightweight and, like, does a bunch of other stuff. So I want that. Just, like, heavy plate armor, if that's okay. And then shield. Okay. And then, like, a sword. Or is that too much? That's fine, yeah. Yeah. So it's a normal armor, regular shield. We'll go, like, moderately powerful weapon. Yeah. Okay.
Group Discussion 02:23:36 And I was thinking, at least for flavor, but it'll be like obviously single-handed, it will be a gigantic claymore that I'm just wielding with one hand. Huge, long sword. Yeah. So important mechanics for that. You don't even have fingers. How do you hold that? I was thinking that when you poured the thing. He's 10 minutes. It's because he's like 10-minute ritual to...
Group Discussion 02:23:59 what is that looking you can't drop it i have a i have a uh i have a i have a mitt he's just holding it it's a two hands old time here come on yeah it's like a lego yeah it's it's like a little uh leather sewn cap that goes over my my stump and then on it it's got the thing that when you go away it opens up when you bring it in yeah and so then i'm just like kind of whoosh whoosh
Group Discussion 02:24:21 But my trunk is just like massive. Oh yeah, he's got three trunks. Yeah, I also, yeah. I'm thinking like Wolverine-ish claws. Extended, yeah, okay.
Group Discussion 02:24:48 Poison? Ocean trash. He's fashioned it out. Yeah, that's great.
Group Discussion 02:25:05 Yeah, I do have a necklace. I picked it up somewhere. I don't remember where, but it's just like a six-pack beer can. Yeah, you literally have a six-pack. Not even like a sea turtle, but, you know, I must have been rooting around or something. I popped out. It's just been stuck now. Gooch the third, what do you want? Yeah, so I was going to do studded leather and a plus one dagger. Dagger, okay. Is that appropriate?
Group Discussion 02:25:37 If it could be a blanket. Yeah, you just got a sword? That would be optimal. Sure. I think so. Got like some armor or something. But yeah, that gives me... So I think we all got armor. A good to hit and an AC of 50. The shield helps him out a lot. Yeah. Yeah, add whatever normal armor. If you pick just a magical weapon and nothing else, like you said, just nature, right? Give yourself a standard or whatever else you want that works for your character. Sure. And my armor's inferred, so, you know...
Group Discussion 02:26:07 You guys pass that. Clear it up. Keep running. It kind of evolves. So who has who? Who's carrying who? I have this super chill dude with a show. I have this elf with big ass ears. He looks pensive. He looks pensive. I think I just grabbed the rest, right? Are you being a Kenyan? Yeah, we can do it that way. You're like a tiny little hobgoblin. You're not going to be able to pack one of those around.
Group Discussion 02:26:36 Okay, so Alabaster, you have Nazariel and Cletus. Just the two of them, I think. Who do you have? Leopold. So, Leopold
Group Discussion 02:27:05 Kaladin, and then I have, uh, ooh. Alright. That's, that's since, it's been a while since I've had those. Oh, fuck, yeah. Um, okay, and then what was that? Oh, yeah, uh, so I have advantage, let me. Uh, so, um,
Group Discussion 02:27:36 15. You don't gain or lose any time on that. You have currently seven days to do a nine-day trip. A hugely successful roll will cut time down. Very bad rolls will add time on. Skipping long rest might be necessary for going or not for going a long rest but then pushing yourself
Group Discussion 02:28:04 Potentially, the water and more points of exhaustion will be in play as you guys trek halfway across the continent as fast as you can. 15, you get to this town in normal pace, and this will be another little map area to explain it. You come into a town everybody knows as Reef Town.
Group Discussion 02:28:31 Reef Town is just a little settlement on a river bank, a lake bank, that is directly across another town called the Marina. Nobody knows a whole lot about this area, but the Marina guards the gate that you have to go through as part of the journey. There's like a little archway on the map that says through. And as you get to Reef Town, what you notice is very odd. You see...
Group Discussion 02:28:58 like jellyfish type people and fish humanoids and like an octopus with dome bubbles on their head holding water as they are all on the land but require water to live and they're walking around their day-to-day business um and it's just a little odd as you guys are like marching up with all this stuff on your back and then you hear uh like nuclear sirens like oh
Group Discussion 02:29:29 gets ejected from the water and crushes one of the buildings. And you hear everybody start freaking out and like a bunch of bubbles are coming out of the little dome helmets. And one of them in like a really squeaky voice says, fire! And you see like a ballista shoots an arrow into the water. And like, and then you see like nothing happens after that. And everybody like goes back to their day to day, like this is normal. You guys have free range to do whatever you would like.
Group Discussion 02:29:58 I'm just... We've been here many times. This is not a new place to us. You have not been here necessarily. This is not a place people go. So, just as a... If I can, as a little bit of background. Do we, like, know each other? Yeah, we've been in the same group serving this mission with the defenders. But, like, has it been, like... It's been a while. I'm going to say the current faith dilation was a month.
Group Discussion 02:30:30 It's been three years in the Fae, and it's been about three months in real-world time, which is when the O'Dears came together and started adventuring. So, we would know what everybody does, right? So, can we get that out real quick, just so everybody knows? Yeah. Barbarian. Barbarian? Magic sword. Wild sword. He's got a little magic blade in there. I'm a...
Group Discussion 02:31:00 You see me shiver because I'm so super cold blooded and I take a swig of my flask that of course is fireball because it warms me up. I'm a way of the drunkard monk. Oh, sweet. I started getting a little tipsy, but nice and warm. My cheeks blush.
Group Discussion 02:31:40 the old pork skin around. D2. So you threw the pork skin around as a pig.
Group Discussion 02:32:00 Like, the fine print, like, matters. You've got to get to it as I slam more fireballs. You all were recruited because you have a very unique ability to become powerful in the Fade quickly. So the training period for you guys was accelerated because of the Expinator. I am a paladin. And I would think that I've been around with...
Group Discussion 02:32:28 Phaelora for a while. Many, many years, right? So kind of like grown up shouldering the burden of the prophecy, knowing no more than like the fact that I needed to carry out my duty. When Phaelora said we needed to assemble a team and
Group Discussion 02:32:47 then we've been hanging out for three years together. After many hundreds of years of, you know, I'm like an old elephant or however long it's been since Baylor and I came across each other, we're like taking this really seriously. And I think I'm trying to just keep it together for the mission. But I can't believe that I'm like, you know, hanging out with you guys all the time. You guys go off and do your own things here and there. Yeah. But you were just like told to come back right away. So you've been hanging out for a little bit now.
Group Discussion 02:33:19 I think the name's good. Gooch? Gooch the Third. Barrow? Barrow is so good. Carrack. Carrack. Alabaster. Alabaster. And what was your? Tortimus. Tortimus.
Group Discussion 02:33:34 The floor is torqued. We've been together for a really long time, so you guys would also know that I enjoy preening, baking. Oh, you're a baker. Yeah, I make things, treats. That's fucking awesome. Little snacks, small plates. You're a rogue, right? Variety of things. I'm a real chef. He's really good at getting things fluffy, gets that air in there. Oh, no, you're a bugger. Yeah, I'm the rogue. Rogue. Is there anybody... Jonathan, how does that make me work? Is there something I can read that tells me... There we go.
Group Discussion 02:34:03 What people will gain in temporary points, or is there anything you mean? I was reading the rules. It's super vague, isn't it? Yeah. Should it just be like a modifier or something? If you click on it again, if you go to the page for Chef, I think they gain the hit points equal to a modifier. Like your proficiency bonus plus something. Four plus your proficiency bonus. So four plus the bonus. Okay.
Group Discussion 02:34:31 Oh, no, that's number of creatures. You can prepare food for them with creatures of four plus micro-creatures. That's fucking awesome. You can just cook up a storm. Like, we don't even have time for resting. Why are you baking?
Group Discussion 02:34:47 Yeah, there's one thing I've learned about this guy is you don't want to make him angry. He needs to bake. Keeps him calm. These treats, the benefits last eight hours. Creatures can use a bonus action to eat the treat and gain temporary hit points that are equal to your proficiency bonus.
Group Discussion 02:35:13 So I suppose, are we making camp? Have we been traveling for a while? It's been like a half day. Oh, half day, okay. Six or so hours you made it to this town. You have to get through that gate, but there seems to be something going on with the townsfolk. So we just need to get through the water? Supposedly. There's a gate in there, I think? Yeah. It's pretty weird, but I think we should just keep trucking.
Group Discussion 02:35:49 indeed the third has the right idea let's go you say that out loud and you see a fish guy who's like headed all the way up in the air with his like helmet on yes no they're so vertical his head is straight
Group Discussion 02:36:14 i am grunkle self good luck getting through there it's guarded by our enemies who took our land i have no time for fools and i just shove him completely out of the way just like he goes flying just like continuing on you see this guy comes out of like a really purple
Group Discussion 02:36:41 better than everybody else around and he's um a jellyfish humanoid shape just very wobbly but like just his head is the jellyfish thing with a little bit of water around it seems to hold it up with some magic and he goes i am the grand bubbler inkthar the wet what's going on on on we need
Group Discussion 02:37:06 Really important. What's the name of our order? You are the guardians of the wild. This is like a known organization. No, you're like the Illuminati. Okay, damn. We're like really important, but we can't tell you why. We're just going to have to take our word. We have a Middle Eastern prince, and we need to get through. He is our leader. One of you is from the Middle East of this continent. We've got to part the sea. My God, and you must get through that gate.
Group Discussion 02:37:37 they got a lot of skits from the last our enemies that can't take this out of our town if you wish to get through that gate you must go through them we stand not in your way could you at least help though i mean they took your land right i wish i could it sounds like you gave it calm down you've got this no they took our
Group Discussion 02:38:06 I understand that, but like, help us get it back then. We're on a strict timeline. I'm almost out of fireball. It's kind of nice being out here. It's really warm. There's no way. So it sounds like you like this better. If you speak to their leader, and they agree to the terms of our war, we'll have it out. Currently, it's just guerrilla warfare, and you see this bird...
Group Discussion 02:38:34 who is not a gorilla. He's got a scuba suit on. He's just been getting fed oxygen. In the water. He bursts out of the water and runs to the town smoke and they kill him down with spears as he attempted to attack somebody. And the Grand Bubbler goes, this is what we deal with.
Group Discussion 02:38:54 Why do they even want to be underwater? They want both lands, and they can't have it. That's not even a water bird. Yeah, they can't even swim. No, it's just a normal bird, and they took our land, and they wanted to be in the water. So if you get our land back... That feels insane. Do you have air helmets that we could use? Do you have, like, an air apparatus made out of kelp? It could give us, like, 30 minutes, maybe an hour. Tops, that's all we need. Hour 45? Hour 45?
Group Discussion 02:39:22 There are some really long reeds over there that you could use to have an air bubble, but that's about it. I do a little elephant line. I have no time for this absolute buffoonery. Let us pass. I'm not in your way, man. He already said he'd let us pass. He's not the one. Okay, whatever.
Group Discussion 02:39:50 roll into the water. Just so you know, we're gonna beat their ass and it's not for you, it's for us. Yeah, because we got eggs. Yeah, once we beat these guys, it's our land now. Yeah, we own the beach. That's my guy. That's my guy outside. He goes, hi, I'm Dirt. What's up, Dirt? Pretty much. I'm just doing this.
Group Discussion 02:40:14 Yeah, hell yeah, man. Fireball. Is it way too hot? Dipped it into his, like, little aquarium. Oh, and just takes it around now? Sucks it up in your eyes. You guys find some scuba suits on the shoreline. Hell yeah. Sitting there, five in a row. There's one elephant-shaped, there's one big-shaped. Yes. This was really fortunate. How lucky. Whoa. The prophecy is true. They knew we were coming.
Group Discussion 02:40:45 You guys are wearing each other's suits.
Group Discussion 02:41:06 Each of you has a lump on the back or on your belt over where your orb is. Was there even a suit big enough? Yeah, there was one that's elephant-shaped. There was one of an elephant-shaped. You guys know that Felara is clearing a path for you. Okay. If she had done it by herself, there's a chance that hers might have got damaged if it wasn't her. So she's ahead of you, sort of escorting the payload. So she probably figured this shit out before you came. Oh, indeed. The prophecy is spoken. She's always so thoughtful.
Group Discussion 02:41:43 Okay. I never wash, so I'm good. You get in the water and there's like a dirt stain that kind of goes around. I take a swig and I stumble, trip, and just slam into the water. You guys go in the water one after the other. As you guys are going down, you're swimming and it's like, as you get to a certain point, there's like street lights of light that light the area underwater. And you're coming up and you see there's this large arch behind it that the gate is closed in front, like it was recently built. And it
Group Discussion 02:42:10 In it, you see, like, swimming around and walking around somewhat awkwardly is an entire population of Kinkoos, bird people who all have scuba suits on because they can't breathe underwater, living in this town, going in and out of the houses, conversing like they live there. But the sea creatures live on land, and they have water? Yeah. Well, they've been destroyed. Yeah. They're so wet. That's perfect sense.
Group Discussion 02:42:41 You live here, man. What's wrong? What do you think's happening? I don't even fucking recognize it. I'm just on a straight mission.
Group Discussion 02:42:52 Oh, Jesus, that's hilarious. Is the gate, like, all of Underwater's like this, and the wall and the gate's like, you can just go over it? No, it's like the whole thing... It's just a random gate, you know, with nothing connected to it. On top is a bridge, but you know you have to go through it, and this gate has been built completely on the arch. It's like this huge door that encloses the space. Gotcha. Like Abracadabra. Like, you have to do a public service in the Fae to get them to open the gate for you,
Group Discussion 02:43:21 to move through. There are a lot. I cleaned up your water to see my children. You haven't made it all the way down. You guys are still going in. As you guys go in, what do you do? There are a bunch of people. Some exchange pleasantries. You see one guy. Let me see. Who do I want this to be? Is a, like, chicken-colored person with a little bit of balding on his neck, and he pushes Gooch specifically. I don't think it's the ball you're being sued for.
Group Discussion 02:43:56 Did the Sephalords send you? I don't think so. Those fuckers on land stole our town when they moved out of the marina and forced us underneath here. I don't think that's it. Pull the knife to your throat. Tell the truth. I don't know. I don't even have a name. It's an age-old tale we've been fighting for centuries, and you see...
Group Discussion 02:44:18 A large stone comes crashing through the water and it sinks really slowly, but it slowly crushes a playground with nobody in it. And they shoot an arrow from underneath and it goes up like part of the water and it kind of sinks down. We haven't quite adapted to living under here totally yet. How long has it been? A couple of months, I think. Oh, a couple of months. That makes sense. So this is like perfect, right? Are you important?
Group Discussion 02:44:48 No, I'm just a guy. Can you point us? Yeah, he's over there. You see somebody walking down the street, walking his, um, he's got a little tiny, smaller, non sentient chicken that just kind of like floats as he pulls it on its leash. That doesn't sound right. The guy next to me says, that's, that's color. The gurgled. Okay. So is that who need to talk to soon? Get through here.
Group Discussion 02:45:15 I think. I'm just a guy. Gooch, not yet. I'll reach down. I'll say, unhand my friend here. The third has done nothing wrong. Oh, cool. Oh, cool. Gooch, the third, to you. It's not funny. You talking about my dad angry at me? It's not that kind of Gooch. You're suspended like a whole lineage, actually. It's a different kind of Gooch.
Group Discussion 02:45:47 what are you guys gonna do we're gonna unpack that later but let's move on you know you have to do a service in this situation to get just leave let's go talk to this fucking jabroni you pointed to the guy walking the guy the chicken walking the chicken you're a man of status he just has a raven but he just has like a small bird oh okay and you walk up and you go how may I help you
Group Discussion 02:46:19 This guy. I think that was it. I think we can go through. Barrow, you made him laugh. I made him laugh. That was a service. You must defeat our enemies, the Sepulorns. Oh. That seems like not cash money right now. So you're saying if they agreed to leave your town, then to come back here? The town they stole from us. Yeah, that's like, okay. Yes.
Group Discussion 02:46:50 Okay. This is really nice and warm on the beach. Would you go back in here? I mean, if they're coming here and we're not going to be here, we're going to go there. I mean, guys, this feels like a slam dunk. Oh, what do you say we round them all up? All right, we'll be right back. Force them out of water. Dude, follow us. We'll lead you up to the beach. You can have it. No, it's actually like... Oh, we have to do a lot of work to be able to do that. I think you should kill them.
Group Discussion 02:47:17 It's not how it works, man. You get your city back. That's it. It's not like how it works. Like I said, man, you're just getting your city back. You're making it hard for us. Don't do that. Have you considered surrender? Never. Why would you say that? They obviously want to fight. They're obviously strong and powerful beings. One of the Kenkos drowns.
Group Discussion 02:47:44 Because he ran out of air? Okay, how about this? You guys shouldn't even be down here. Like, look, man. Everybody's wearing suits. Don't you want to wear not-suits? The suits are not comfy. It's like the principle of the matter.
Group Discussion 02:48:04 Okay, hear me out. What if we go up, we say, you guys are down to go up, drop the suits, you can have the beach forever. Like, no war needed. Like, you have it. They can't go up there anymore. While you're distracting them, we come up and we stab them. No, that's not what I'm saying. But then they go down, like, even opposite sides. Like, that you go up one side, sneak attack, right? Except we're gonna fool them to go down the other side.
Group Discussion 02:48:33 And then they get the water forever, you get beach forever. Like, no war needed, no casualties. I like this part. Beach is super chill. They get to vibe, you get to vibe. Everyone vibes. I hand him some fireballs. Everyone vibes, dude. He, like, he takes off his mask and he starts drowning. Oh, fuck, I'll give it to you when you get up there. He drowns? No, no, no, no, no.
Group Discussion 02:49:02 Jesus Christ. You gotta do this whole thing again with somebody else. Well. Okay, he doesn't drown. Dude, that was a close call. I should have waited. He's spitting up in his mask. That's my bad. He's got water in the lines. Okay, you go up. You get everyone. You go up on that side of town. I'll give you a swig once you get up. They get down. I give them a swig. They go down. Fireball treaty.
Group Discussion 02:49:30 Right? Yeah. You see both sides kind of agree to live peacefully. Okay, but before that, fire! And usually they shoot like a fucking trebuchet of rock that was flying out of the water. Do you hear like distant screams as they crush a house?
Group Discussion 02:49:55 now okay now you're even that just happened to you you did it to them we're fine that's last thing right yes okay y'all you guys you guys go get the fish i'm leaving this these birds up here on this side yeah they're all disadvantaged
Group Discussion 02:50:13 Can you give me a perception check? With disadvantage? No, I have disadvantage. Oh. Is everyone doing perception? I guess so, yeah. Perception, now I get advantage, which is nice. I got a 10. Perception, 14. Still 12. 19. 19. Nice. They're gold. Plus zero. He cut a little too loudly, so one of his little assistants goes...
Group Discussion 02:50:50 I didn't hear it, so what did he say, Gooch? These guys are super down with my plans. What did he say, Gooch the Third? There's no problems. I await your return. He died. Oh, you think they're trying to pull a fast one on us? I heard him say he was going to kill me. I feel like if we get... Our mission is to get to the gate, you know?
Group Discussion 02:51:17 So we're doing, we're at least doing a couple minutes of like peace, but that's still the service of they get the beach for a bit. I have no time for mercy. Let's kill these guys. A service of letting these guys fight seems like what they want anyway. Who's going to let us through the gate if we bring them up? The fish ones. We haven't agreed. It'll be part of the deal. We haven't made that deal. It's what they want. Can I get close to the gate?
Group Discussion 02:51:46 I would like to sneak in through open water. Yes, I'll say as a rogue you're good at sneaking but I'm gonna say give me it still with disadvantage because you're part of the conversation so I have... You did just out him as saying that. I have... I'll try to say it quietly. I have reliable talent so it's at least
Group Discussion 02:52:10 Oh, a nat 20, right? No, it's disadvantage. 17 plus 11, so 28. How do you have disadvantage? Oh, because you're swimming through open water? Because I just said the thing that made the... I'm going to give him a perception check with advantage just looking at you. Oh, yeah. But he still needs a nat 20 to win. Okay, that's a goal. I just want to get over there. That's a 2 and an 11. You kind of get out of his immediate vision...
Group Discussion 02:52:40 And you go with it up to the door and you get all the way up to it and it's this huge door. So I'd like to think that I said that and then I kind of just like shimmy my feet and get all the silt to kind of rise up to kind of cover me up a little bit and I just kind of like crawl along the bottom. Anybody else? I'd like to find... I'll take one. Same thing? Yes, sir. Yeah.
Group Discussion 02:53:14 The door is like a single piece when you get up and inspect it. It looks not new. It just doesn't look like it's a natural environment. Oh, I thought you said this seemed like they corrected a gate. Can you hand me the sour worms? There's three left. That's all right. There's three left. There's nature and then
Group Discussion 02:53:45 Do I get the impression that I could pick something on this to open it at all? No. You think that it's with the fable shit, you have to do something in the sound to unlock it. Somebody has to admit that you helped them. I'll just, I guess I'll get away with getting over there and I'll just like dog paddle back.
Group Discussion 02:54:14 Rejoin the conversation. This is the Feywild. We're doing the service. Fish guys are going to get their water. Even if for a second we did them a service. He's going to unlock it for us, no doubt. I promise fireball for both.
Group Discussion 02:54:36 They want to fight, dude. Let them switch and do it again. This has probably been happening for a long time. You bring them up that way, we'll bring them down that way. Yeah, we only have like a week, man. We've got to do this fast. Alright, mother cluckers, get over here. That was a great joke. Thank you. I said, hey mother cluckers, gather up. We're going up. We're going up, boys. And girls.
Group Discussion 02:55:05 Get all your eggs in order. So I guess, which of us, I'll go up, because I don't want to be in the water anymore. My charisma is at minus one. Are we going to go try to convince them? We're convincing the fish people to make peace? We're convincing the fish people to go down. And kill them, or what? It's so quiet. Okay, they're still into that? You're just trying to talk.
Group Discussion 02:55:39 them the same deal. Indeed, Gooch. Gooch, what would we do without you? These positive affirmations mean more to me than my whole childhood.
Group Discussion 02:55:54 I was thinking we incite a civil war and have them knock each other out so we don't have to deal with this absolute ridiculous circus anymore. Dude, you're an elephant. Elephants are at circuses too. You fit right in. Exactly my point. Except we're underwater, right?
Group Discussion 02:56:23 So you don't really hear that. You just kind of see some bubbles coming out of my trunks. Yeah, turntail. Which trunk makes that noise?
Group Discussion 02:56:34 All of them at the same time. Gotta have more than one. Who's with me leading these motherfuckers? I'm gonna go up. We're gonna convince the fish people to come on back down to their village. And we're gonna promise them the same...
Group Discussion 02:56:56 They can have everything they want. Because we'll be gone by then. And they'll continue to do what they've done for centuries. Okay. People are going up. You re-approach the Grand Bubbler. He's just chilling and sunbathing right now. Just getting some color in his jellyfish form. I didn't know that. You have good deception. I don't know why. Oh, yeah. I got a plus seven. He pulls up his sunglasses around his aquarium. Um...
Group Discussion 02:57:28 do you have yeah man like we talked to them and you can have the village bag so we don't kill them well you can do that right afterwards we're gonna trick them give me a deception check oh I was gonna do it can I also say something or is it too late
Group Discussion 02:57:57 Yeah, we're hanging out down there. Are you drinking? Always drinking? How does that work underwater? You got it. Hand in shell, up. Okay. Just constantly blasting. That's not good. That's great. Give me a perception check. Do I do it too or no? You're watching this.
Group Discussion 02:58:28 19. Nice. 15. Well done. He doesn't quite buy that somebody's not off. So he makes a little nod to one of his shark bodyguards off to the side. And that's what you notice. He's like, okay.
Group Discussion 02:58:58 now get the armada together yes sir and you see like seahorses with helmets on and people riding them and like well that's that should be happening right now the fish people have or the bird people have control of the gate currently and they're in the water so either we're gonna lead them by the gate since we're doing this act he's gonna unlock it they're going up we're going through fish are coming in and then who fucking cares dude
Group Discussion 02:59:27 This is going to be a complete slaughter. We're going to lead them around the other side of the bank to the entry point. The opposite of their exit point is. A lot of sashimi today, boys. As the fish group start moving into the water. Snorting. They get into the water. Because you noticed it before, you see that two individuals stay behind.
Group Discussion 02:59:58 when the rest of the group leaves. Could I have said something to that guy? Kill the sharks. Okay. The guy with the knot. The guy that got knotted to. The shark bodyguard? Yeah. He's coming with, but yes. Oh. Did we watch who he went and talked to? Because I noticed that there was a nod to this one. The shark went and talked to the people. Yeah. So I'll go to talk to one of the guys that got left behind.
Group Discussion 03:00:40 He's a mage type, so he's smart. He's plus 8 actually.
Group Discussion 03:01:11 He goes... No, I think I'll stay. But... Nibbler. And you see this little fish warrior guy goes... Yes, there. Is that the other guy who was there? Yes. So this is who you're talking to. Oh, sweet. Who won't leave. And he's like...
Group Discussion 03:01:42 He's like, head that way. Yes, sir. He's going down. All right. Did you leave yet? The rest of the group has gone into the water. I would have trailed. You want to knock him out? Yeah. Pose him. All right. Yeah. I'm going to say, okay, hello. I'm going to go up here now. I'm going to try to like, are we just on the beach? Like in the open? Yeah. There you go. Hold. I'm going to.
Group Discussion 03:02:12 Kick some sand up. Disappear. Can I burrow?
Group Discussion 03:02:20 Kick some dirt up on yourself. I want to make it really hot. I'm just going to rage straight towards him. Raise my shield and run at him. Do a sand mermaid like a snow angel. It might distract him. Go ahead and do an attack roll is how effective it is in getting in his way. Cool.
Group Discussion 03:02:49 I'll just use my strength. Am I going to use my weapon modifier on it? So you're just saying a straight melee attack for this? Nice. 25? Yeah, 25. Go ahead and get away. Give me a stealth check unless you fail really bad. Well, I have reliable talent.
Group Discussion 03:03:22 Nice.
Group Discussion 03:03:26 What is the reliable... It means that on my proficiency skills, I can't roll less than a 9. Oh, wow. Plus whatever the modifier is. So I think my stealth, sleight of hand, and deception, I can't roll less than... Less than a 9. Less than a 9, plus 8, or plus 11. That's a 19, but you beat that. Yeah. So you get away. Okay. What are you doing? I'm going to murk him. So I'd like to wait until he gets distracted, distracts him. Yeah. And then I'm going to like...
Group Discussion 03:03:55 He does, like, burrow into the snow and then, like, move over it or, like, right between his legs. And I want to stab him right under, like, the knee. Okay. This will be roll initiative. So you went to Jack. I'll roll initiative for him. Yikes. And then you roll initiative. But you'll get a surprise round. All right. So that's 17 plus 3.
Group Discussion 03:04:14 That's shout out to Kruber's initiative. This is Merid. Merid? Yeah. Nice dude. Okay, what'd you get? 17 plus 3. 9. 9. 9. I'm still remembering your name. You're forgetting Gooch already? Gooch the third, dude. Gooch got Gooched a lot. That's good. A little softer.
Group Discussion 03:04:43 That one's a dimmer. Okay, Gooch, go ahead and roll your attack with advantage. So it's plus 8. So, dirty 20? Dirty 20 hits. Alright, so that's going to be a dagger. It's a plus 1 dagger, so it's 1d4 plus 4, so that's 5. And then my sneak attack damage.
Group Discussion 03:05:12 15 piercing damage. Just fucking ripping out his Achilles. Prison shank style. Yeah. It's just like the fucking nastiest little rat you've ever come across.
Group Discussion 03:05:35 What did you add? I didn't take a second time talking. That's a thing I just never got to then. You were just talking to that guy and I was just like... The voice. The voice is hilarious. Maybe it's a d6 of your... It's so quiet, cowardly, and cheeky. Oh, so I could use one less d6 and then try to trip? Yeah. Can I do that? Can I move that for now and change it to figure out what it is? So I can redo the whole class thing. Can I do that then? Yeah. Okay, well then what was it? What did I say it was? 15?
Group Discussion 03:06:04 So we take an average of 3 off of that, so it'd be 12. And then I'd like to have him roll a DC 15 dex check, dex saving throw, or be prone. So I hit an 8. That's a 15 plus 5. This guy looks healthy. This is like a big guy that got left behind. I'm going to use my bonus action to hide.
Group Discussion 03:06:33 Give me a self-check. Swoop in, stab him in the knee, and disappear. 18 plus 11, 29. Yeah, hold on. No, it's a 6. It doesn't seem. Okay, after that is carrot, or crap. Oh, crap.
Group Discussion 03:07:00 So, Gooch is hiding now? Gooch is hiding. Well, I'm still there. Yeah, you're just getting ready for your next sneak attack. I will say, if you are hiding, you are not engaged with him, so you are not getting an advantage. Yeah, there's no parrying. That's fine. No, that's okay. I won't hide then.
Group Discussion 03:07:21 I'll cower. Can I cower? You can cower. Yeah, bonus action, cower. That's kind of what you already do. Stealth. Stealth. Well, if that's the case, then I'll just hit him again. Yeah, do that. It's a d4. It's a crit. I should use my sneak attack on that one. So that's a 1d4 plus 4 crit. Oh no. That's 5. 2d4 plus 8. 10 damage.
Group Discussion 03:07:51 Bummer. What was his AC? What was your first roll? I rolled a dirty 20, I think. Oh, and it didn't hit? It did. Oh, okay. Well, I hit my sneak attack on the first one. He's taken 22 damage so far. Okay, so your little first attack did hit. I thought he, like, repelled. He just did a thing where he had to roll. Because I rolled a 5 plus 12 for my sneak attack. Oh. Oh, gotcha. Yeah, I rolled another one. He would have fallen prone if he failed. Yeah. Got it.
Group Discussion 03:08:21 I'm gonna... I'm gonna move up to him. I'm gonna close the distance, but I'm gonna make sure I'm flanking. Yeah, I'm still standing. Yeah, for advantage. Do you want a guy? You can put any guy. I'm gonna go ahead and rage. Nice. He's just so pissed. I don't have... I don't know where the spell table is.
Group Discussion 03:08:46 Like the glass? Why do you think he bakes? Is Carrick just like a stoner who gets really fucking angry? No. He has roid rage.
Group Discussion 03:09:07 It just gets, like, kind of frustrating. If you're breaking the vibe, it gets you. I told you to chill, don't get me mad. I got a six. Until my rage ends, I gain plus one to my AC. And while within ten feet of you, the ally also gains...
Group Discussion 03:09:34 bonus to the AC. So Mike, so you've got a plus one while we do this. Your shield becomes two shields. Oh, that's cool. I like that. And then my first attack's going to be a 14, I think it's a plus eight, plus nine, so 23 to hit. And then second attack is a 15 plus nine, 24 to hit. Yeah.
Group Discussion 03:10:03 And then damage is gonna be a four, I don't know, one. So five plus 16, 21 damage. Well, it's five normally, but...
Group Discussion 03:10:17 Yeah, slice them up. What do you hit them with? You have a sword? So I stabbed him in the side of the knee, and instead of hiding I stabbed him in the same spot again.
Group Discussion 03:10:39 Double tap. That is brutal. And then he gets hit. And then I take my dagger and I switch it to the other hand. And I stab the other knee. And I would get advantage. You're ambidextrous. Advantage because he's there, right? Something called rockish audacity. You can give yourself advantage when you don't otherwise have it. Yeah, but it takes my bonus action. And also I have panache or something where even if he's within five feet of the guy,
Group Discussion 03:11:13 AC. Oh nice. So to hit is another dirty 20. Okay so this will use my sneak attack and then I don't think I can do that. I was going to say I could just roll to see if I hit again and then choose which I sneak attack on but that's not that's not perfect. Yeah okay. So better so that's eight piercing damage and then
Group Discussion 03:11:39 Another... How much sneak attack counts for? What is that, double? You just roll a whole bunch of d6s for the attack. I'm going to lose another one. He has plus 5 on his dex. Yeah, so what do you roll it with? It's a 15. That's average. I'll stick with it. I'll drop a d6 and just roll 4d6 to try to retrieve again. You're prone. It's not bad. It's not bad. 4d6.
Group Discussion 03:12:06 14, another 14 on top of the original 7. That's 21. 4 plus 5 is 9. Okay, so he falls prone. And then bonus action again with... And that's another 19 to hit.
Group Discussion 03:12:34 How many actions do you get? Just action bonus. But the sneak attack counts as my first attack. It's the same, it's just more damage. Okay.
Group Discussion 03:12:50 It was the same hole twice on this leg. Oh god. Two here and two here. Turned him into Toonie Salad. And he's a fish. He'll go, I'll do the only thing I can know how. And he'll rotate out of one of your areas of...
Group Discussion 03:13:18 attack to the other to get you in a line. So, who is that on the back there? That's me. Then you get an attack of opportunity. Oh, no, no, no. Sorry. This is Tortoise. Gooch. No, Gooch. Sorry. Okay, Gooch. It's his turn. He just moved out of your space. He slash I didn't...
Group Discussion 03:13:38 Forget it, but I didn't realize that it was going to be you right there. If you land on your truck, you do a sneak attack, which I get, because it's another turn. So I'd still get advantage because of being... Yes, when you left your space, he was right there. 17 plus 8, 25. Yeah, that hits. This guy's just going to get fucking marked right here. That's a big hit. 15, 24, 28.
Group Discussion 03:14:09 I'm going to hit him in the same third time. He had 78 damage on a 100 hit point health roll. Exactly kill him. So I hit this knee for a third time, and it falls off. And then I go back to the other knee, and I just... And he just goes... You've got something called elemental demise. If he dies, his body disintegrates into a burst of water and foam.
Group Discussion 03:14:39 You cut off one of the legs and he started to... He got rid of the body for you. Alright, let's check and go. Standing next to him is the little guy. I forget what I called him. What? No, he was supposed to leave. He hadn't left yet. You attacked him right away. What? Nibbler. I wanted to wait. Nibbler. Nibbler. Nibbler. I thought he was gone. You just fucking started stabbing this guy. Fine, I'm taking him. He goes last in the initiative with a two. Three minus one. He goes...
Group Discussion 03:15:14 Which would be a natural one. He misses. End of turn. Just trips. I'll avenge you. Start of the initiative is Gooch again. Okay. Where is the guy? He's right here. He's right here. He's still like right here. He's like right over here. He never left. He's just like a big eyeball. I'll just go around and I'll sneak a trick. Or I'll try. Oh yeah. Okay. 15 plus 8. 23. It hits.
Group Discussion 03:15:45 Alright. Doesn't move, starts to attack. Does he have knees? Knees? Yeah. He's got knees? Alright. He's much smaller than you are. I'm gonna go like this and just... Save the... Save the... Knees, yeah. You got one move. His knife is so blunt, he has to just... Yeah. I stick the knife back in my loincloth. That's why it takes three per knee. Yeah.
Group Discussion 03:16:08 Oh, it's really intense. I need to do some deep breaths and calm down. Can you do deep breaths while you walk? Yeah, that's fine. Okay, let's go. Can you carry me? Bro, come on. Okay. Slow place. You guys go into the water then. You walk in and as you walk out...
Group Discussion 03:16:35 As you guys, the other group walks out with the bird people, they see the dead foam just laying there and they know what it means already and they go, who was the, whatever his fucking name is, Honk Crow or whatever the fuck. He goes,
Group Discussion 03:16:55 Finally, we have both looks to his head like chicken. Thug guy goes, kill these useless fools. You guys under initiative. I love it. I love it. The ones that stayed behind? Yeah. The bird people are going to... Wait, we're against the whole tribe? Where do we end up then? You're with them. Okay. The three of you are... We're hanging out with the bird people, yeah. The two of us were coming down. There are only three...
Group Discussion 03:17:27 You guys want to use our guys? Plus zero to initiative. What the hell's going on? What happened to the peaceful treaty? 18. There's that. Oh, sweet, dude. This guy. Yeah, I'll turn to them and I'll say...
Group Discussion 03:17:51 Like a stampede, my justice is never ending. And charge in to start slashing them. And then we're just headed down, right? Yeah, we've already missed this. You killed the water. We've entered the water. You guys are exiting. You don't see any of this. We're just going down what we assume is an open gate.
Group Discussion 03:18:15 Oh, yeah, did they get a chance to try to open the keys? That's a total clusterfuck. Before they came up, or? No, nothing had been completed yet. Okay. Well, like, we just chilled for a second, dude. Just get his keys. Get his keys, yeah, take the keys, man. I think it's, uh, when I went to go try to pick it, it was just, like, a big plate. Like, magical. Oh, I rolled an 18. I don't know who's, uh... Yeah, I think we're getting an initiative set.
Group Discussion 03:18:43 I can do the written initiative, like I said. I just have to find a bird creature that's strong enough to be fun. Okay. It'd be fun to just wipe into... Of the group, this guy is the most powerful. Oh, shit. This guy's the most powerful. These are like the very same equivalent of just like one HP cronies next to him. What is everybody's initiative total?
Group Discussion 03:19:12 Uh, rolled an 18. 18, 9, 8. Okay, who has the better deck? So, 18 or... You rolled it? No, no, I was just pointing. Oh, 18. 18, 9. Trap had 9. I had 8. Sorry, Barrow had... I don't want to f**k these birds up in this elevator. 18, sorry, I'll just do it the normal way. 20 to 15, I have 18. Anybody else in the 15? Okay, 15 to 10? 10 to 5?
Group Discussion 03:19:41 Okay and then five to zero. We've been training for three years. This guy got a three.
Group Discussion 03:20:04 I just go in my shell. Were you guys expecting to be betrayed by these people? I think you had mentioned it. Yeah, we'd already talked the plan out. Yeah, I told them in front of these guys, that's why I rolled disadvantage and stuff. Like, these guys are not...
Group Discussion 03:20:22 um starting off alabaster you get to go in you've got this very skilled fighter and two little guys next to him how do you want to approach it yeah i'll just come up uh and unsheath my giant long sword and slice it around really fast like you wouldn't believe underwater i'll say oh we are on land okay perfect
Group Discussion 03:20:45 An elephant never forgets a debt or a slight. And I like run straight at him. He never forgets anything.
Group Discussion 03:21:00 a longsword that was just very large. Yeah, right, because it's a single-handed weapon. It'll do 2d8 damage instead of 1d10 or 1d8 for longsword stats. So it's extra things that it's so big it does double damage damage. Awesome.
Group Discussion 03:21:17 Cool. Yeah. And I'll just, I'll go in. Oh shit. I don't even have a weapon attached yet, but I guess at this point I would have a multi to attack. So would the hit die be the same for an unarmed strike? No, it's a D 20 plus. We'll figure it out. What's your proficiency bonus? Where's that? Oh, plus four. What's your strength?
Group Discussion 03:21:41 Or are you dex or strength-based? I'm gonna do strength-based. Okay, so what's your strength stat? Three. So three plus four, and then it's a plus, or at least all plus one, so plus one, so you have a plus eight. Plus eight. Plus eight to hit. Which is like the average to hits across for most things, unless you have especially good bonuses. Plus eight to hit, and it was a 2d8?
Group Discussion 03:22:03 2d8 plus your strength on the fire. Which would be 3. Plus 1, so plus 4. 2d8 plus 4, and it's a plus 8 to my roll. Okay, so then I will roll to strike 3 plus 8, so an 11. 11. That does not hit the main guy. Sweet. It's such a big sword. It goes right next to his body. The sand explodes around. It'll do some better. Then I'll slice out of him. So I'll kind of...
Group Discussion 03:22:28 unbury the sword out of the sand and say, my memory is but a tombstone and your name is already on it. Oh, you're running through your catchphrases. And that's 15 plus 8, yeah. So 23.
Group Discussion 03:22:49 You'll never forget this. I've had a lot of time by myself to come up with these. I feel like we've been waiting for combat. But anyways, so that's a 2d8 plus... Nine, but you said it was plus four, right?
Group Discussion 03:23:18 Okay, so 13 damage on that sword strike. Okay, after that is Barrow. Oh, Barrow. We're on the way.
Group Discussion 03:23:36 Pharaoh unsheathes a short sword from one side and a scimitar from the other straight curvy, curvy-durvy. And he just dives towards the closest bird on his stomach and tries to fucking whack at it while he's sliding. The little one or the big one?
Group Discussion 03:23:54 Just like on your belly. The big guy's been attacked only for 13 games. Yeah, he's not hurt much. Are you like, slowly moving? I got a little running start with my trotters. Doze straight at it. This guy trots a lot. This guy trots a lot. This is the short sword? Yeah. Okay, what are you wanting to do?
Group Discussion 03:24:24 damage, vine whip, things like you want to have a ranged ability. You can give yourself...
Group Discussion 03:24:36 an element earth earth okay rock spire it does a d6 of force damage it just makes him dirty so you just open the vacuum cleaner bag and it just puffed you and then as I go and stick my flies on him
Group Discussion 03:24:57 For my swarm ability, I'm going to hit him with another d6. Go ahead. It's a piercing damage if it matters one. One more damage. Okay. Anything else, sir? I guess I have two attacks. I slice him with the other thing. Instead of Josh, okay. Yeah. The fly is like your pet? Nice. It's a swarm, man. He commands the flies. He's the lord of the flies. Nice, nice, nice. Nine more. Nice. As I slide by. Swine and a fly.
Group Discussion 03:25:30 That's great. Tor, you're up next.
Group Discussion 03:25:36 I'm gonna I got a couple attacks here I'm gonna go for one of the small ones on the side first just doing my can my claws count as an arm strike that's just like natural yeah so this is what we're gonna call this so your claws get your martial arts bonus so they're unarmed strikes attack bonus you have a plus three to slashing damage
Group Discussion 03:26:07 Sorry, not plus 3, it's a plus 1, but you get the d4, because is that your martial arts or your d6 right now? Like, the basic thing? D8. D8. So you do d8 plus, we'll say, a d8 slashing, and then it's a, we'll say, a plus 1 weapon like everybody else. Sure. So you'll have the plus 1 to damage and to hit. Okay.
Group Discussion 03:26:33 Okay, so that will change my plus 7 to a plus 8, and my plus 3 to a plus 4. Plus 4, yeah. Pretty much on par, except you have the extra damage die, and then I'll work out the extra stuff, because you said, like, you want to poison the thing to go with. Sure. Cool. Okay, first guy to hit 18. 18 hits. Who? Is this the main guy or one of the side guys? Uh, side guy. Yeah. Okay.
Group Discussion 03:26:56 one HP, minimum damage. Okay, roll the eight. You just bisect it, but your claws leave three little slices in between. And then the slices come off separately. And then I'll redirect back onto the main dude. Sixteen? Sixteen hits.
Group Discussion 03:27:23 And then I'll bonus action. What's the word? Flurry of Blows. Gives a focus point, so I get my actions in. I'll swing both at him.
Group Discussion 03:27:37 14 and then less than that. Epic. Tragic. I'm gonna drink to this later. Okay, after that, it's this guy. Fuck dude, I fucked up. I killed the wimp, that's all I did. He's still registering, he's like, wait, you're not surprised that we're betraying you? Dude.
Group Discussion 03:28:04 No. Fuck you. He goes to stab you. Gooch fucking heard you, dude. Fucking Gooch. He's the third. They've had two more to experience. This is a talent attack, but it's with a knife. That's a 16 plus 13 to hit. 29. Plus 13. I got a shell. It hits.
Group Discussion 03:28:30 Just a shell. Ow. Don't hit my shell, dude. I live in here, too. Homeowner. Don't chunk me, dude. I shed last week. There's way too much time before the next. You get 20 points of piercing air. Jesus. Oh my gosh. I'm fucking dead. That's his turn. 20 you said? Yes. Holy shit. This fucking bird's red, dude.
Group Discussion 03:28:59 yeah uh all right so alabaster uh after kind of slashing but not really doing much damage kind of swings back around with the sword and i will try to bestow a curse on the main guard uh by just driving my sword straight in and kind of twisting with like this black acre coming out and i'll cast uh bestow curse
Group Discussion 03:29:26 Um, and they will need to make a wisdom save of 15 or greater. Wisdom is a plus 4. Okay. That's a 13, so 17 total. Ah, shit. Okay, so that doesn't work. So...
Group Discussion 03:29:50 That was my action. Let me see if I can do anything as a bonus action. I'm not sure if I can. Oh, I can cast Spiritual Weapon as a bonus action. Can it attack or is that the next? Okay, so excellent. Oh, I can't cast a spell as a bonus action.
Group Discussion 03:30:14 That's why we're learning. That's why there was no getting out of the combat. Everybody was betraying everybody at all times.
Group Discussion 03:30:29 Okay, yeah, so then I guess my sword will kind of slide maybe past his breastplate, and then I'll ruffle at him and kind of go, and push him back, and just prepare for another strike later, and that's the end of my turn. Barrow. Barrow. There's just a big guy left? There's one little guy. Okay. Do the two guys look at her? There's one little guy that's dead, one guy, so...
Group Discussion 03:30:58 Current state. Yeah, someone hurt. Not quite halfway, we'll say. Really hasn't been hit that hard. I flipped him once, dude. Fuck you. Back seven with the short sword. Roll the hit. 23. 23 hits, obviously.
Group Discussion 03:31:26 I'm going to do the same swarm. Mud comes out of my sword. And it smacks me in the face. That's my force damage. And then the fucking flies pinch his ass. The sword's coming too. Fuck. I got two ones on the three. Seven plus four. Eleven on the first one. I say, you're an asshole. And I slap at the little guy. I slap at the little guy. You're not doing anything.
Group Discussion 03:32:00 to hit the little guy. Let's go. So he's dead. Four damage.
Group Discussion 03:32:14 but his eyes go wide when you hit him with the head and like split his skull and he starts bleeding but before he dies he goes but my kids oh my god hits the ground he goes i haven't had any yet oh my god i was a dad in the future how did you stop that i don't feel as bad yeah he should stop the blood the blood spurts out he dies i will not learn from this
Group Discussion 03:32:46 I'm going to try punching him again. I'm just going to roll both. And him twice. 17 and another one. Oh, did I ever get a course? I don't think so. How about one right now?
Group Discussion 03:33:04 Oh, five damage? That happened to me last night. Somebody asked me. I was like, can I get one? And they came back and I can't get one. That was me this time. Because we ran out of banquets. I just have a quarter. Okay, I hit one for five. You can have a Van Hingen, too, if you want. Do you have the lagers, actually? Oh. I love that one.
Group Discussion 03:33:30 I'm going to bonus action Flurry Blows again. Okay, don't you have Stunning Strike? What does the Dragon Master do when it hits?
Group Discussion 03:33:38 They have stuff where you spend the points and... Yeah. A lot of my stuff is for when I'm getting attacked, not when I'm attacking. Which is why I said... I'll attack you next to, like, practice. Yeah, I didn't want to... I was going to bonus action. Your dagger is a distance weapon when it links back. Oh, yeah, never mind. I'll use that.
Group Discussion 03:34:08 13. That probably doesn't hit. 13 misses. Where'd my... 10 damage. Oh, 9 damage. Nice. Fuck you, dude. In the transparency, they both have generic 100 hit points. We're at 65.
Group Discussion 03:34:30 Who more misses this round than last round? After that, it is this guy's turn. He's going to go after you. He takes two attacks. I only did one last time. I forgot to do the other. Okay, first one is a 17. That is my... Okay, and the second one is a 18. Also hits.
Group Discussion 03:35:01 That was a high damage roll. You take 13, 18, 25 points of damage in the first hit. Okay, I'm just reading really quick. Okay. And then 10 points there. I forgot that again. My drunken technique. When I use Flurry of Blows, I gain the benefit of Disengage. Which means you leave for free. So I could have left, but that's for next time because I forgot again.
Group Discussion 03:35:29 Yeah, the monk has a lot of random shit like that. I can take a reaction to reduce the attack's total damage by 1d10 plus 12. Damn. Okay, so the first one was 25. You can reduce that.
Group Discussion 03:35:44 So the way the Drunken Master moves is like a tank then. Yeah. 12% 19. Is what you reduce it by? Yeah. Okay, so it does 6 points of damage. That's cool. If it gets to 0, I get to do other stuff. The second one was 10 points of damage. Okay, so I do it again. 6 plus 12, 18.
Group Discussion 03:36:14 Yeah, roasted pear. That's right. Maybe some walnuts.
Group Discussion 03:36:24 If you reduce the damage to 0, you can expend a focus point and redirect some of the attack's force. Then you get some of those almonds that are like skinned, like they don't have any skin on. If it is in between total cover, the attack is very immune. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 deck saving throw or take 2d8 plus 3 damage. Truffle oil almonds.
Group Discussion 03:36:51 It's okay, it tastes a lot better than a bill that's been flying around people's pockets, getting farted on. Okay, so I took six damage at a time. Yeah, that was insane. That whole round? Yeah, you reduced it from 35 to 6. Yeah, that's crazy. Which is why I said, oh wow, I could have done a lot against the one I took, like 30 or whatever. Okay.
Group Discussion 03:37:19 Yeah, getting more frustrated about this impassable bird. I guess I don't know where my mini is, but I would have been in combat, yeah. I'm just going to take, I'm going to use as a bonus action, I'm going to cast Spectral Weapon, or Spiritual Weapon. What does it look like?
Group Discussion 03:37:46 uh the spiritual weapon yeah oh yeah um i'm sure it's got a real name yeah you see you see a spiritual weapon just kind of apparate into space and it's a large battle axe like double-sided axe you might see like a really massive kind of warrior carrying around um and it just like whoosh whoosh whoosh
Group Discussion 03:38:10 And then kind of like settles a little bit. Yeah, I thought it would be really funny because they can look like whatever you want. Yeah, so you just bring in a face or a vase or whatever. It's like from your closet. It's like a bouquet of flowers. That's great. Anyhow, so that will be my bonus section. Oh, you rolled a hit when you cast it? When you cast it, it affects. And it has a bonus action every turn afterwards.
Group Discussion 03:38:44 Oh, no way. It's out there. Yeah, it's a non-concentration bonus action damage every round. You lose it unless you die. Unless you roll an actual one, then it doesn't do anything. An eight. Yeah, that's true. If they target it, but even then, it's like a free spell. A spear of a weapon, yes, a spell. So that was my bonus action, and then for my action, I'll take two strikes.
Group Discussion 03:39:05 uh with just my uh main swords that's a plus eight i think we said yep so for the first one i guess where is everyone could i get flanking in this yeah yeah we're just like up on them okay i'll just kind of position myself around the back side and i'm gonna go for one of his wings i'm just gonna try and fucking slice off a wing
Group Discussion 03:39:28 My classic rules is that when you aim for specific body parts, it adds to the AC. Wings are pretty big. Are you trying to cut it off at the base or totally remove it? Yeah, I'm just hacking at the base of the wing. It'll add five to its AC. Okay. AC of 20. AC of 20, all right. If you hit regardless of the damage, you'll cut off a wing. Plus eight. And with advantage, too, because I'm... Where's my... There it is.
Group Discussion 03:39:57 Oh, double 18s. Yeah, so that'll definitely end. So I'm just going to slash off one of its wings. What the fuck is going on? He does belong in the water, dude. Now he can't even fly. That's a 2D8. There's no point to any of this now. I haven't done any of the drills that we were practicing.
Group Discussion 03:40:24 all right boys let me show you how it's done the wing goes flying off and i'll say that's your last flight son no i should have been you've been grounded yeah you've been grounded i'll never see the skies yeah seven uh plus four so yeah it's all your fault another 11 damage on that one strike and then at the second
Group Discussion 03:40:49 uh just so you can't even like there's no mercy i don't know you're gonna charge me yeah i was gonna say you could charge me a little bit more for that yeah it's the same thing all right yeah i'll just go for the other one so just lop off one and i'll just come around uh 16 plus five so 21. yeah and i'll just come down and uh be like there is no mercy for a traitor
Group Discussion 03:41:19 Finish him, boys. Oh, yeah. I don't care. It looks cool while I was doing it. Yeah, he has no wings. He is not going anywhere. Your swimming days are over, son. Oh, shit. Double ones.
Group Discussion 03:41:42 Plus four, so six. This one's for Gooch, and I dive under him and try to fucking stab him. Stab him in the Gooch? 26 hits.
Group Discussion 03:42:11 While you're slicing him? Oh, there's a chipmunk on the road out there. Oh yeah. She spotted that chipmunk. She wanted to get it.
Group Discussion 03:42:31 Just floating
Group Discussion 03:42:56 You're sensitive, you cannot grab that. I tried to do this peacefully, dude. That hits. Okay. You do a memo of three damage, you're gonna kill it. He's got it already, then. Seven damage. Woo! Finished it. I just fucking uppercut him in the noggin and snap his neck back. And the blades go through his skull. I didn't want to do this!
Group Discussion 03:43:22 I knew you had it in you. You guys do that and you turn and all of the rest of the bird population is watching. They look around and they're like...
Group Discussion 03:43:50 We're not with that guy. Dude, open the gate and then get the fuck on the beach. We don't live in that city anymore. That's what I was saying. Then get on the beach. We're on the beach. We're on the beach. Okay. None of the other unless we're fighters. Don't make me do it again. And then, um... Just fucking murder this guy. Do you guys rejoin the group in the water? I stagger over. Okay, you guys make your way to the water. I do the thing. I stagger in and follow you. Actually, you'd be a great
Group Discussion 03:44:17 Yeah. Just put a little bubble on your head. They were living down there underwater. We cut back to you guys. You guys get to the gate with the high bubbler, whatever the fuck his name was. That was a great job. And he goes, you've done us a good service. And you hear just like, as he says that, and the gate opens behind and you guys have
Group Discussion 03:44:45 Indeed I showed them no mercy
Group Discussion 03:45:09 You guys killed their leader, right? Not just like a little underling? No, just totally an underling. Oh. We killed their leader. It's fine. The gate's open. We're out of here. We did what they wanted. We're the good guys in this. I ground his bones to dust. He was in my way. We did both parties a service. We're the good guys. We're like the Illuminati. We're just moving. Who wants to roll a d20?
Group Discussion 03:45:39 I would like to roll it. Higher a little before you roll it. Oh, fuck. He has to fall. Okay, I rolled a 20. 20. 20. Fuck. You guys hear howling.
Group Discussion 03:45:52 kind of from the way you came on the path. A bunch of sounds of wolves running towards you. And you hear just in the distance, track them down, we know they're this way. And you see the gang of wolves and the three pigs that rule it chasing after you. You have no time for a rest. You have to keep going. Guys, we just killed the anger birds. They're the ones that are good against the pigs. Let's just go through the gate and get away.
Group Discussion 03:46:27 I just said it in silence. I was processing it. I was angry. Alabaster did the first survival check, correct? Yeah. Somebody else do a survival check to try to get away before you have some sort of encounter. I'll do it. Do I add stuff? It's a survival check. My survival's not good. Okay, I get plus six. You have ghost survival? Yeah. Plus six is pretty decent.
Group Discussion 03:46:59 location. This is just the start of that. About a 12. 12. Decent. You don't get into a fight right away. They are still like hot on your heels so you guys are running with your little amber people on your backs and on your side as you make your way going forward. My head's at my foothold now. I'm at the head hole now. I sort of planned on like a one event
Group Discussion 03:47:27 per session thing for this Feywild little side trip. So this, you guys start making your on your way to three days. So it's, you're currently going to make it three and a half days, um, travel, uh, and you haven't gotten any farther.
Group Discussion 03:47:45 ahead. You need two days that you have to gain somewhere in there. Or even. At the end of this, you guys, you'll have your rest in the normal, so unless you guys want to push through a night and take a point of exhaustion, you can cut off time. Yeah, let's push. You're taking one point. It's just a skill
Group Discussion 03:48:07 and the skill checks. Which would be survival, but... That'd be bad for me because of stealth and deception. In three and a half days, you will have done four days of travel. Right, we have to cut three days off. Yeah, we have to. So at least we'll do every other, that way we're not doing anything worse than that. And then really good checks will also give you a chance to cut a day off. So three and a half days, your half a day extra, we're going to sort of close out there.
Group Discussion 03:48:41 I'm in my, in my sprint. Uh, but then in that point you guys would have long rested. So you say, here it goes. You, you push through one of the nights. So then second night, normal third night, you could push through again.
Group Discussion 03:49:00 And then have one point of exhaustion going into the next session and having covered another half day. So being a day ahead, you get four and a half days instead of three and a half. What do you guys think? Push hard early and then we can reset yourselves to a full rest status, but give yourself a point of exhaustion and you were at
Group Discussion 03:49:23 4.5 days. I don't even think I took any. Oh, I guess I did. So we took a long rest, essentially? You basically get multiple. So this next check was for three days of travel. You guys chose, this is a group you can disagree if you want, but it's been done, that you push through on two of the nights, sleeping in the middle so that you minimize it. You'll go into the next session with a point of exhaustion, so which is disability on ability check, disadvantage on ability checks, but you have cut a full day off of your travel already.
Group Discussion 03:49:52 Okay. You need to cut two more days off somewhere. So we didn't take any rest at all then. You take long rest. But we have a point of disadvantage. Yeah, so it's just like you have all your abilities and stuff are recharged but you're just more tired. I didn't sleep good that night. I need 12 hours. I need my 12 hours. I drink a lot, guys.
Group Discussion 03:50:23 Are we taking a break as that's happening? We're good to call it. Okay. Yeah. Nice. That was fun. That's a good setup for the in-person. Got the characters all in. We know what we're doing.

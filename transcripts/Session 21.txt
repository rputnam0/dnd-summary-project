Kaladen Shash 00:00:03 break. Uh, I'm at 20 of 75 and if we short rest, I don't have any dice to use because of our previous altercation on the other side of the temple. I'm not like death deathly, but I'm not going to take very many hits.
Cletus Cobbington 00:00:07 Silence. Silence. Silence.
Cyrus Schwert 00:00:14 OK. Maybe we should
Kaladen Shash 00:00:36 Got unlucky with that clinical. Let us press on.
Cyrus Schwert 00:00:45 Should we find the other? What? Or should we just go home and go to bed? Um, I'm fine with either. Yeah, that's what I thought you were gonna say. Yeah, that's really gonna help. Thanks.
Cletus Cobbington 00:00:51 I have some luscious almond milk for you to drink to recoup some HP.
Kaladen Shash 00:01:09 What's, what is, how much is that healing worth?
Dungeon Master 00:01:11 And if you guys. Is it really? Dario pops up and goes.
Cyrus Schwert 00:01:14 Chunky, it's really hot in here. Oh, we only left the house two days ago. Third Command, give him the milk.
Cletus Cobbington 00:01:19 We ran out of ice about three days ago, so. Let's see. Well, is everybody a little fucked up?
Leopold Magnus 00:01:23 Woo! I'd be happy to try it if you don't mind.
Cyrus Schwert 00:01:41 Oh, it's just real.
Dungeon Master 00:01:42 Well, uh, I'm feeling pretty healthy, actually. Uh, Zargill is Zario, but holy shit, hey, that's pretty goddamn close to how he sounds.
Cletus Cobbington 00:01:49 Well, since you sound a little funny, you wanna use your healing spirit again? Well, I got a couple healing spells, but I also have the healing spirit as well that everyone can use a little juice from. Oh.
Leopold Magnus 00:02:12 I'm actually set. I was just curious on how the chunky almond milk tasted. Oh, why, thank you. Ooh. A delicacy on the farm, huh?
Cletus Cobbington 00:02:18 Well, here's non-healing chunky milk. The glass is weirdly chilled, but the milk is so warm. It's the only way I can sell it actively at the market.
Dungeon Master 00:02:32 What a combo. Really contrast the warm chunk.
Cyrus Schwert 00:02:35 I hear the frosty glass is the most important part.
Kaladen Shash 00:02:38 It absolutely does.
Cletus Cobbington 00:02:48 The illusion of chill. All right. All right. You know what? I'm going to just start off and use a third level healing word on Mr. Kaladin. Let's see.
Leopold Magnus 00:02:51 I'm tipping it back. One last big chunk just slides off the rim of the glass. Delicious!
Cletus Cobbington 00:03:17 Are we, wait, do we have, um, whatchamacallit active? The, uh, like the map thing so that we can all connect. Is that, I don't see it active. Hmm. Okay. Well, I'm going to do this one on my own. It's not showing me that at the moment. I'll see what I can do.
Dungeon Master 00:03:26 If you go to the campaign page, there over your character will something will say join VTT. Is the extension enabled on your computer?
Cyrus Schwert 00:03:28 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:03:49 Anyway. Ah, that's what it is. Different monitor. Well, let me do this real quick and then I'll get that set up. I'm really worried.
Dungeon Master 00:04:03 That's right, you guys essentially just have more rooms to go through otherwise. What is that? Don't ever cast polymorph on him. He'll look exactly like that no matter what. Oh, and then.
Cyrus Schwert 00:04:04 It's my character, but if I was a pig.
Kaladen Shash 00:04:14 That's where it'll happen. Yeah, you just don't see the tabletop.
Leopold Magnus 00:04:16 Nice.
Cletus Cobbington 00:04:27 God. Yeah, I know. Oh, like even if I'm not connected. Yeah, I'm going to have to ditch this monitor in the second one. It is so laggy. It's taking three minutes to release dies.
Dungeon Master 00:04:32 Just so you know, Trace, your roles do show up on our thing, too. Even if you're not. Because your character is a part of the campaign, you get all your roles.
Cyrus Schwert 00:04:42 Yeah, a little bit.
Kaladen Shash 00:04:44 It always shows up in the game log. Always we just were seeing the game log in a different format.
Dungeon Master 00:05:03 Do it again. But yeah. You guys take a little bit to heal. If you want, you can just roll the dice manually too. That's a crime. 64 plus something.
Cletus Cobbington 00:05:14 You see, I definitely would, but I don't have my dice with me. 64 plus four. I should be able to join pretty quick here.
Cyrus Schwert 00:05:17 64. 64 plus.
Kaladen Shash 00:05:20 That's all right. What's the amount for that? I'll just type it in. For a really soft rule, I'll take it. That's OK.
Dungeon Master 00:05:45 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2. That's okay. Zario probably has some other heals to hold on. You see Zario also types up, he goes, uh, well, uh, I guess Kaladin, I could heal you up as well. And he'll do a third level healing word as well.
Kaladen Shash 00:05:57 Oh, the... Much better. Yes, that will do. This is good.
Leopold Magnus 00:06:32 The music's pretty sick.
Dungeon Master 00:06:36 I'm going to change out just so everybody hears it. Jesse is using the old version of Healing Word, but they buffed it when they released the 2024 format, so I'm going to give him the new Healing Word. It's stronger. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:06:55 Oh wow, is it just? It's just more. Healing. That's cool, they did Buffett. Yeah. No legacies old. Sometimes there's almost no difference. Really like, but that's that's that's significant. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:07:04 Is that what it means when it says like legacy is legacy the new one. I see.
Dungeon Master 00:07:08 Yeah. Legacy is the old one. But there are, like, especially, like, healing spells got a buff, because healing spells have always not been worth it.
Cletus Cobbington 00:07:34 Let me see what I have then. Oh, I have the new one, okay. Does it matter what version of a spell that I use? Cool. Sure, yeah, yeah. I noticed that with some of them that I was looking through and I was like, hmm, I mean, some of them sound way cooler on the old one.
Kaladen Shash 00:07:35 enhances the value of that party member. You can still choose.
Dungeon Master 00:07:44 No. Do whatever. There would just be a benefit to using some over the other, like, for example, the new healing. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:08:10 All right. Are we ready to find more circles? Orbs?
Cletus Cobbington 00:08:13 you
Kaladen Shash 00:08:18 or circles. Do we see anything in this room? Is it clear of all things? And have we been in this room already that we can see in the back corner? Back here, 17.
Dungeon Master 00:08:29 Yes, you got the orb that was in this room. Where? Yes, you went up there. That was all of the locks that you had to undo in a certain language. And behind there was the... I forget which key it was because I moved it off of the area. I think it was 4 that was right there.
Kaladen Shash 00:08:47 OK, OK. Yeah, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:09:04 And then, hey Brent, whatever you, I think you took 12 from Zario. I'm gonna roll it at the level that it should have. So whatever, this is over 12. Yeah. No way. Okay, well, you just get 12.
Cletus Cobbington 00:09:06 Silence.
Kaladen Shash 00:09:18 Okay, so take 12 off and then, or over 12, okay. That's all right.
Dungeon Master 00:09:33 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2. Bad roll. Get them out early. OK. So you guys have sort of this direction that you can explore, this direction, or this direction.
Cletus Cobbington 00:09:40 And I think we should run like real far.
Kaladen Shash 00:09:57 Yeah, it's just to what we're right next to. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:00 Yeah, the close side. Makes sense. I'm pretty tired, guys. I don't know about you. Long haul. This old grease?
Cyrus Schwert 00:10:04 It's gonna take a while to get back over there. We ran for about 36 seconds. You're sweating. How are you sweating? Oh.
Cletus Cobbington 00:10:15 Real warm after my journey last time. Too much almond milk will do it to you. Wait, do you have an allergy?
Kaladen Shash 00:10:27 And we're chomping it.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:28 Yeah, I'm not sure that almond milk was, um, well, feeling a little bit sick, to be honest. Oh. Oh, I didn't, I didn't tell you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:10:37 It looked grey. I didn't know an almond was a nut. I thought it was a fruit. I'm not a good farmer.
Cletus Cobbington 00:10:50 Well, you asked for the milk. Depends how you look at it.
Kaladen Shash 00:10:57 As we pass through that eight room, did we see things or something in this room now as well positioned here?
Dungeon Master 00:11:12 No, sir. As far as you can tell. Seemed like a room that you could take up hold if you were going to take a long break in it. Easily defendable, only two doorways.
Cletus Cobbington 00:11:28 Well. I mean that get some spell slots back that we just used. But I'm good otherwise.
Cyrus Schwert 00:11:28 Hmm. I mean... I mean, uh... I don't know.
Kaladen Shash 00:11:29 Do we need to long rest before we continue? I think they used a lot more healing.
Leopold Magnus 00:11:42 Only I used a first level spell.
Dungeon Master 00:11:54 So you guys, up to you. You notice that this door right here has some engravings on it as you like go down the hall. And this one is just seems to be a regular.
Kaladen Shash 00:11:57 Yeah, I think we could long rest before we...
Cletus Cobbington 00:12:09 I think I might have marked him as dead again.
Cyrus Schwert 00:12:15 What? Am I not there? Help. What the hell? I'm not dead. I'm here.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:19 Where's Cyrus? Is he not in the room with us? I don't see your icon.
Dungeon Master 00:12:34 Any diary? Delete it.
Kaladen Shash 00:12:37 I don't know buddy.
Cyrus Schwert 00:12:44 Oh, God. That was so scary. Is that? When it gets bad, let me know. I'll just turn my video off.
Cletus Cobbington 00:12:45 Well, your internet's dying, fuck. It's like half the words sometimes. It's better this time than last time, but it's just robot-y a little bit. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:13:08 Um, yeah, I guess let's, I think long resting could be good. We can blow through the last three rooms and then if there's like another thing we've got to do to engage all the orbs in one last room, we'll at least have some, some stuff left over.
Cletus Cobbington 00:13:16 Pull out my little hay pillar.
Cyrus Schwert 00:13:23 I think that makes sense. I don't know if I'll sleep, but I can lay down and just think about my experience.
Leopold Magnus 00:13:28 Yeah, that's fine by me. I don't need it, but it won't hurt.
Dungeon Master 00:13:37 OK. You see a. Zariel suggests that you guys go back to like a more defendable spot and suggest like maybe up in this room or locked up in this room somewhere familiar to you guys.
Kaladen Shash 00:13:38 All right. We could head back to room 17 for a long rest.
Cyrus Schwert 00:14:03 Okay. That's true.
Cletus Cobbington 00:14:03 We're saying.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:07 Why, I think that's a good idea.
Kaladen Shash 00:14:10 A special lock on it that we can unlock. We'll just long rest in 17. It's got one door to get in and out, and we've got the key.
Dungeon Master 00:14:27 And you see Azariel puts down the pocket workshop, opens it up, and the O'Dears, you see, sort of climb into their little magical dimension. And that's where they seem to take up their camping each night.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:44 I think I have an Alarm spell. Can I, before we long rest, Ritual Cast Alarm right here, just so that way if there's any presence that comes in at 26, we'll know. We'll do that.
Cyrus Schwert 00:14:47 I have to get in there.
Kaladen Shash 00:14:49 Like a Mary Poppins style, like just walk right into this toolbox and it turns into like a little pocket universe. Yeah, that's cool, that's cool.
Dungeon Master 00:15:06 Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:16 Give us some time to prepare. Yeah, I'm not too worried about it. All right, taking a long rest?
Kaladen Shash 00:15:21 We should be pretty good. I only need four hours of rest to get everything back and we can take a little turns.
Dungeon Master 00:15:38 Okay, as you guys start on your long rest, unless you want to do anything specific out of your way, things go pretty smoothly. Who is taking the first watch, if you are taking watches?
Kaladen Shash 00:15:53 I can stay up for the first watch, so I just need a four hour rest. Okay. Oh, it's hot.
Cyrus Schwert 00:15:58 Not me don't want to watch This is wow, uh
Dungeon Master 00:16:02 Nice. OK. On the first watch, go ahead and roll a d20. Nice. OK.
Cletus Cobbington 00:16:04 Ha ha.
Leopold Magnus 00:16:27 Hell yeah. I can do a second launch.
Dungeon Master 00:16:30 Great, nothing happens. Your watch, four hours, gets completed without issue. We just need either one or two people, because if Kaladin gets to take first watch each time, you guys are basically doing two shifts at once. So who's going to take second watch? Alrighty. Leopold, go ahead and roll me a d20. You are...
Kaladen Shash 00:16:37 or meditate.
Dungeon Master 00:16:57 hoping to not get under a five. Okay. Your watch goes off without a hitch. You guys all wake up having taken and completed your full rest.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:02 Well, pretty close, but made it. Indeed, let's get at her.
Kaladen Shash 00:17:15 Let us go. I don't know what that means, though. Let's just do the job.
Cletus Cobbington 00:17:22 All right. Pitter patter, let's get at her. Oh, Cyrus.
Cyrus Schwert 00:17:38 I think it's a sex thing. Probably. Usually when I don't know something, it means it's sexual. I'm pretty sure. Hey, wait up.
Dungeon Master 00:17:45 This is probably. Okay. When you guys finally do get there, do you want to go to the door on the left or the door straight ahead?
Kaladen Shash 00:17:47 you.
Cletus Cobbington 00:17:56 I pat Cyrus on the back and just start walking.
Kaladen Shash 00:18:14 The door on the left, the one with the runes, or the markings you said? Can I, do we understand what it says?
Dungeon Master 00:18:18 Yes, it's just got an engraving on it. Yeah, let me just find it. Okay, yeah, so you walk up to this door and you notice it's another pinprick.
Dungeon Master 00:18:42 little mechanism where it's got the slate slab up against the wall with a little needle, and you see that on the door it says, face yourself to progress.
Cyrus Schwert 00:19:00 Oops.
Kaladen Shash 00:19:00 Well, that's interesting. I don't... Perhaps this is the daughter we finish with when we have all of the orbs? Do you feel like there's a challenge in there for a key?
Leopold Magnus 00:19:04 face yourself to progress. Well, I would suppose that maybe we'll just end up, you know, fisticuffs, but with some some other face of ours, like some some clone or something. That would be my thought.
Cletus Cobbington 00:19:23 I prick Chip's finger on the pin. Huh.
Kaladen Shash 00:19:33 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:19:43 You see it, you pick it on the print and it goes onto the slate and then it absorbs into the stone and disappears. Chip looks at you and just.
Cletus Cobbington 00:19:55 Insightful. All right. Prick my little thingy.
Cyrus Schwert 00:19:57 I want to play!
Dungeon Master 00:20:10 prick your finger, you notice the blood also absorbs into it. And as far as your vision goes, as soon as it absorbs in, you see a handle appear on the doorway before it was a flat surface. Anybody who hasn't pricked their finger would not see it. Very similar to the entrance.
Cletus Cobbington 00:20:28 Hey guys, there's a handle. It happened again. It lacks my blood.
Cyrus Schwert 00:20:34 Should we go explore other things before we go in there? Should we just send it? Should we send it?
Kaladen Shash 00:20:44 Yes, he's already started the handle. We'll all do this now. I go and just slap my palm on it.
Leopold Magnus 00:20:47 Well, I'll again slap my greasy gears up in there and get a little bit of that juice up on the slab.
Dungeon Master 00:20:55 You do it, exact same thing happens, handle shows up.
Cyrus Schwert 00:21:08 I will also choose my slab. Thanks.
Leopold Magnus 00:21:15 Expertly done, Cyrus.
Dungeon Master 00:21:22 Everybody juices their slab, you know? And each of you see the handle appear one at a time as you do it. And for whoever's the first to go in, you notice that when you grab the handle, it's almost an incorporeal doorway that you open and you pass through, but everybody sees you just walk into the flat surface. But once you enter into the room, you notice it is just a large circular room
Cletus Cobbington 00:21:25 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:21:50 with a thin layer, almost like a millimeter maybe, but very even surface of a dark crimson liquid that sort of coats the whole floor. You see there is a pedestal in the center of the room with nothing in it. Yep.
Cletus Cobbington 00:22:13 Hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 00:22:15 Whole floor is liquid? Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
Dungeon Master 00:22:19 We'll say at this time nobody's walked in. Center of room, so 10, 15 feet. It's very thin and you can, so you can tell it's just like a very basic stone floor underneath.
Kaladen Shash 00:22:25 is how far away is the pedestal? And this red liquid is non-transparent, like we can't see the bottom of the floor. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:22:49 But we'll say it's like maybe not the entire floor, right? So if you look into the room, you open the door, there's like enough space for you to be in the room and standing on it without stepping onto the fluid. Nope, millimeter at the thickest would barely coat the bottom of your boots.
Cletus Cobbington 00:23:07 Hmm. Does the water look deep? Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 00:23:08 is.
Leopold Magnus 00:23:20 I, uh, I'm gonna reach out, find a pebble on the ground and just toss it in the middle of the liquid. Well, gents.
Dungeon Master 00:23:28 ripples go off of it, nothing seems to happen. About 15 feet to the center of the room. And the pedestal is just like, you know, six inches in like total diameter, each way, the circumference all the way around.
Cyrus Schwert 00:23:37 How far is it away? How big is the thing in the middle?
Kaladen Shash 00:23:39 15 feet, 10.
Dungeon Master 00:23:55 It's very thin, goes up maybe three feet off the ground. It's the same way that you've seen all the other little podiums rise out of the ground to give you the keys. This one is up, but there's no light orb on it. Nope.
Cyrus Schwert 00:24:08 Is there anything on the walls in the rooms? In the room?
Cletus Cobbington 00:24:09 Bye.
Kaladen Shash 00:24:24 Does this oil look like it? Does it? Does it look like oil or does it? It's just a clear fluid. Nothing happened with the rock. Crimson. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:24:31 A dark crimson liquid. It does look like blood. A sane green liquid, you know.
Cyrus Schwert 00:24:38 Does it look like blood? Ew. Ew, that liquid is very sanguine. Yeah, it's a sex thing. You wouldn't get it.
Leopold Magnus 00:24:56 Oh, Sanguine? Hmm. Well, you keep saying that, which is probably true, because I don't get many things. I'm not sure who that was, but I did, you know, get activated in a sewer without much memory, so. All very new to me.
Cletus Cobbington 00:25:01 I was gonna say, define that.
Dungeon Master 00:25:02 Hehehe.
Cyrus Schwert 00:25:09 Like Sheldon from Big Bang Theory. That's crazy.
Kaladen Shash 00:25:12 Real, real story.
Leopold Magnus 00:25:29 Yes, Zario could tell you all about it one day.
Dungeon Master 00:25:34 Yeah, I'm feeling a little shy right now. I don't know that I want to. Nope. Nothing at this point in time. It is an empty circular room, a pedestal in the center, a thin layer of blood on the ground.
Cyrus Schwert 00:25:39 See.
Cletus Cobbington 00:25:41 All right, do we want to?
Kaladen Shash 00:25:42 Do we see there's no other writings on the wall? There's nothing there. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:25:59 No light sources into the room, so you're sort of seeing everything off the light sources you bring in. Sort of reflecting off of the little current that you created with the ripples. So the light sort of refracts back. But dark, empty room.
Kaladen Shash 00:26:14 OK, I feel like, perhaps, unless somebody wants to walk through your blood, we're OK here. Kind of gross. Yeah, go there.
Cyrus Schwert 00:26:21 I don't really want to do that. Not yet. Hey!
Cletus Cobbington 00:26:28 We can continue. I was getting a little interested in dipping my toesy in there, but we can continue on. All right, fuck it. Nope.
Dungeon Master 00:26:37 Okay. As you go that way, you see another room. This one is different in that as you enter this space, room 24, the door on the top right,
Leopold Magnus 00:26:44 Let's do it.
Dungeon Master 00:27:03 sort of your right as you walk in, there is a huge, large stone door that has 10, like, half-sphere holes in it, with, like, little, like, space for the Roman numerals to be facing inward into the, like, the stone inlets. And then there's two other doorways here. So, big-ass door on the right, and then two exitways.
Kaladen Shash 00:27:05 Yeah. Looks like perhaps that is where we finish. That's definitely the door.
Cletus Cobbington 00:27:13 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 00:27:37 I definitely agree with you, Kellen.
Kaladen Shash 00:27:41 Can I look through this door? What's over here?
Dungeon Master 00:27:46 You go that way, and since there isn't anything you'd be missing, I'll just show you. It seems to be just a double back area as you're going through to a place you haven't been.
Cyrus Schwert 00:28:06 I mean, we could have ran that way.
Cletus Cobbington 00:28:13 All right.
Leopold Magnus 00:28:22 Does it connect then over here? Got it, got it, got it.
Dungeon Master 00:28:27 Somewhere. You guys haven't. There is something in that room you guys haven't done yet. Nothing in there. You go through just another, like, restrooms. You go through that door. Another unnecessary roundabout leads into a room.
Kaladen Shash 00:28:33 Yeah, over here in 19. Very cool. Excellent, what's in the store?
Leopold Magnus 00:29:06 I'm not seeing what you revealed.
Dungeon Master 00:29:07 Just a hallway? Just a hallway. So there is this long ass hallway that leads to, you went to the door on the top, which seems to lead around the bed, and you figure it's to the same place that this door leads to, the common room.
Kaladen Shash 00:29:07 Yeah, I was gonna say, I'm refreshing. I didn't see, I was wondering if I didn't see it.
Cyrus Schwert 00:29:38 is.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:39 Paladin, do you want to take a look behind that door?
Dungeon Master 00:29:43 You guys are looking that way simultaneously. Cyrus goes. This way. And it's down this way. Whoever.
Cletus Cobbington 00:30:13 I want to go down there. I think all of us.
Dungeon Master 00:30:17 Let's go down there. OK. So who is all going with them on that? You step into this room, and you notice that as you step in, it's the same as the other challenge rooms. You step into this space, and there is a flash of gold around the border of the room that follows this sort of black ichor. And sort of emerging from the ground, you see a creature that you have
Kaladen Shash 00:30:18 Yes. The whole party is moving that way.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:22 All good.
Dungeon Master 00:30:46 already fought in once that proved somewhat challenging but not the super hard one. There is this sort of shadow demon-y looking creature that sort of comes out, hits the ground, this sort of smoke billowing off of it. Everybody roll initiative.
Cletus Cobbington 00:31:04 Oh, those fuckers. Plus five to initiative.
Kaladen Shash 00:31:12 Yeah. Everybody rolling. 24 some spot.
Cyrus Schwert 00:31:16 Spoopy.
Dungeon Master 00:31:25 Perfect. We've got 24 on Cyrus, 20 on Kaladin, 17 on Leopold. Your Steel Defender goes... Or is that the old one? You haven't rolled in this game yet, have you? We'll see what you get updated.
Leopold Magnus 00:31:26 It'll turn in. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, 17.
Cletus Cobbington 00:31:53 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:31:55 17th stage, still defender goes with you. Let me roll for Zariel.
Kaladen Shash 00:31:55 Yeah, that's fine.
Dungeon Master 00:32:18 He got a 18, so he actually moves up. And the shadow demon is at the end with a 12. So first up, Cyrus, you have got a floor. You fought this creature before. You're familiar with it. How do you want to start this? Yes. The non-magical weapon you had.
Kaladen Shash 00:32:27 Let's go. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:32:35 Is this the one that fucked up my scimitar before? Could you make a peacemaker for me, by chance? OK.
Cletus Cobbington 00:32:43 I think so.
Dungeon Master 00:32:53 Oh, I didn't finish it. Let me get that to you. You do technically have a magical weapon. That's okay, I can do it real quick.
Cyrus Schwert 00:33:03 I'm an adventurer, and I can do it. Can I go in there? Step space. What's up, little shoddy? What's up, little shoddy? And I swing my new sword at this fucker.
Kaladen Shash 00:33:06 Yep.
Dungeon Master 00:33:29 Okay, this sword is a plus two weapon and you get a, um, what did I say? It was a d6 of force damage. And then there's also the ability to cast calm emotions when you hit a creature with it. That's like a charge based thing. I just haven't done that yet, but I don't know if you want to do that.
Cyrus Schwert 00:33:41 I nicknamed it Xanax. What would I add to this in theory?
Kaladen Shash 00:33:47 That's cool. Calm, calm down there.
Cletus Cobbington 00:33:52 Might need to hit yourself with that one. Calm down a bit.
Dungeon Master 00:34:12 you would what's your scimitar say you're to add in seven so you'd add nine so it'd be a d20 plus nine and then a um do you want it to be a long sword a rapier a short sword
Cyrus Schwert 00:34:12 Because that X thing, too. Devin.
Cletus Cobbington 00:34:27 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 00:34:43 Are you nervous for me? Yes. Yes, you can.
Cyrus Schwert 00:34:44 It's supposed to be a scimitar. I like the vibe of that. Possible. Can I have it be a scimitar? I like the vibe. At least for now. Maybe I'll change my mind. Maybe I'll... Why didn't it go? I'll just do it in here.
Cletus Cobbington 00:35:08 So tell him.
Cyrus Schwert 00:35:17 So, 18. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:35:22 18 hits. And then tell me the damage out loud. I'm going to be on a different page while you guys are doing your stuff, creating the sword for you. So I'll just do the damage on paper. What was that damage?
Cyrus Schwert 00:35:54 Getting confused about how to roll those. Sorry. Dicks.
Dungeon Master 00:36:03 Do slash R space. 1D and then as a repeater D6 or EA. So then write 1D6 plus 1D6 plus and then your damage would be DEX plus 2, I think.
Cletus Cobbington 00:36:14 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:36:39 That's funny, when I click it, it does damage. I don't see it. What is the result? Nice. And then 10 plus what? What is your stuff's got now?
Cyrus Schwert 00:36:44 Go.
Kaladen Shash 00:37:08 What's six? I think he said. Oh. Oh 717.
Cyrus Schwert 00:37:21 and plus 16. Can you hear me now?
Dungeon Master 00:37:23 Do you guys hear him? 70. Nice.
Cletus Cobbington 00:37:34 Plus 7, 17. If that's not what you said, now you have a plus 7, Trev.
Kaladen Shash 00:37:44 more canon. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:37:53 Yeah, I can hear you then. Nice 18 hits.
Cyrus Schwert 00:37:56 OK, cool. We'll take it. I can try my best to swing again. It's just annoying. Another, oh, I enrolled a hit. My B, my B. Same thing, 18. Hit. And then this is plus 7.
Cyrus Schwert 00:38:26 12. And that's my turn. I will end it. Thank you for bearing with me. That's fine.
Dungeon Master 00:38:26 12 more damage. Great, awesome. Up next, Kaladin, your turn. Okay, and Travis, I will do the details later, but I'm just giving you a sword that has the right bonuses. I'll let you know when you can refresh your page and try to add it. Give me a second.
Kaladen Shash 00:38:36 As I enter the doorway, I'll cast Esoptic Blast right in its face. That's great.
Dungeon Master 00:39:05 Go for it. Natural 20, obviously. 14 hits. And does not hit.
Kaladen Shash 00:39:08 Did it show up for you yet? Obviously. The second one. 14 to hit. That does. And then the last one does not hit. Nine. So it'll be 3D10. That'll be forced damage.
Cyrus Schwert 00:39:10 It's two in a row. You've only rolled twice.
Leopold Magnus 00:39:12 Hell yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:39:13 Cheers.
Kaladen Shash 00:39:39 It's coming in. OK, not bad. For 17. And then I'll go ahead and. Get in. I'll go ahead and get into a position where I'll have advantage on an attack with light splitter. Didn't get advantage on that one.
Dungeon Master 00:39:50 Beautiful. It doesn't have any resistances to that. Looking pretty hurt already. Go for it. Oh, 12 exactly hits. Oh, no, sorry. 12 misses by one.
Kaladen Shash 00:40:08 First one is not going to hit, so second one with the other role. OK. OK, other. Does it think in this?
Dungeon Master 00:40:19 Sorry. But 28 does it. Travis, if you refresh your page, you should be able to look up Peacemaker and add it as a sort.
Cletus Cobbington 00:40:25 Haha.
Cyrus Schwert 00:40:32 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:40:39 Alright, and that's going to be. It's slashing. And then radiant damage is the smaller. That's the three. Yeah, that was the last dice roll.
Dungeon Master 00:40:53 You notice that the... Radiant is 3 damage, is that what you said? You notice the Radiant seems to have an extra strong effect, where the Radiant slashes through its form and has trouble sort of phasing in and covering that space, so like open wound over the shadowy tendrils of the bright searing light does double damage.
Kaladen Shash 00:41:18 Excellent. 19 total. Very hurt. Yes. Really wanted to take it down. Hit it with anything.
Cletus Cobbington 00:41:20 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:41:23 It is so, so incredibly hurt. You see Zario goes, well, I guess I'll do something. And he asked Thorn Whip at it.
Cletus Cobbington 00:41:50 Silence.
Dungeon Master 00:41:53 14 hits. And with 7, you see Azariel Stormwhip comes in and strikes it in the center of its form. It just splits in half, imploding from the inside, really not loving that Radiance damage that Kaladin had dealt to it. Kaladin, you had left it with 1 HP.
Cyrus Schwert 00:42:06 Oh. Too bad.
Kaladen Shash 00:42:21 That's good. That's good. Teed it up. Like, I have to boost Ariel's confidence, you know? It's been a little bit since a good kill, so. OK.
Dungeon Master 00:42:22 It was as close to dead as possible. And then you see this creature falls, a pedestal rises out of the ground at the back of the room, feeling a orb on it with the Roman numeral for seven.
Cletus Cobbington 00:42:24 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:42:48 Just need 3 and 10 now, we're getting very close. Yes. Let us go back down to this door down here.
Cletus Cobbington 00:42:56 All right. Well, I think we should go on back to room 23 and cut across back over.
Cyrus Schwert 00:42:56 Almost found them. I just don't want to go back to the blood room.
Dungeon Master 00:43:23 As you make your way through all of those hallways, it takes some time to navigate. Guys looked for things that you haven't missed. So you're not necessarily moving at half speed, but it just takes a little bit. And eventually you come to a very large room, but you notice that there seems to be some like markings on the ground already. Um, like some scuffle what happened and like, there's no gold thread as you walk into the room, but you notice that, um, on the ceiling,
Dungeon Master 00:43:52 like sort of perched up at the top haven't noticed you yet you see two of these uh grotesque fly creatures seemingly in like um not a slumber but an unconscious state you probably get a free hit on them like to start the round
Leopold Magnus 00:44:08 Like we'd get a free hit on him if we. I'll let you guys go ahead first then.
Kaladen Shash 00:44:15 Let us be sneaky then. Doesn't always go well. Leopold is just a large suit of armor. He doesn't do great with these. Pass without. Oh.
Cyrus Schwert 00:44:21 What is here?
Cletus Cobbington 00:44:23 where we could sneak on by. Someone here does.
Leopold Magnus 00:44:39 Well, I tend to clink and bang and creak.
Kaladen Shash 00:44:44 Does does Ariel have passed without a trace? I think he's casted on us in the past. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:44:53 I believe he does. Zariel does have it. So Zariel will use his just so you guys don't have to use yours. He casts Pass Without a Trace on everybody. You all gain a plus 10 to your stealth bonus as the shadows seem to cling to you wherever you move.
Cletus Cobbington 00:44:54 I do. Network. All right.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:18 Okay, we're just trying to go down here, is that what we're saying? What, the next door? I think we're trying to be very sneaky, maybe we don't have to fight. Do we also think that if killing them also produces the pedestals, right?
Cletus Cobbington 00:45:24 Well, there's two doors, right? Do we want to do the first one? Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:45:27 But it's.
Leopold Magnus 00:45:28 And we're not going to take these guys out. Okay. I think that's what we've seen in the past, but maybe this room is a little different. Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:47 Well, I mean, the blood or whatever could just be that they've already killed things trying to get to it.
Cletus Cobbington 00:45:57 I mean we can get some sneak attack and just go for it as well. I just thought since they haven't noticed us maybe we could sneak on through but if that's how we get the orbs. Let's use the tried and true. Alright.
Leopold Magnus 00:46:12 Well, let's just, uh, not be so rash. We could sneak, and if we can't find the key, then maybe we come back and kill him. Oh, thank God. It was a 1 and it rolled to a 19.
Dungeon Master 00:46:26 Okay, everybody give me stealth checks as you move through the space. Everybody gets a plus 10 to whatever they want. We've got a nat 20.
Cletus Cobbington 00:46:33 Oh baby. Big boy got a net 20. I turn into a little, a fur ball and just roll.
Kaladen Shash 00:46:41 Gosh I love that
Leopold Magnus 00:46:46 22.
Dungeon Master 00:46:49 Cletus, as large as this form is, is muffled by the fur on his body, and you see that he just hunkers down, just the largest lattice creature, sort of silently. You don't even hear a rustling of space on the ground as Cletus is the first to clear it without ease. Are you going top door or down?
Cyrus Schwert 00:46:55 Thank you for having us.
Cletus Cobbington 00:47:04 With that one, I'll go to the further one.
Dungeon Master 00:47:27 As you go through this space unnoticed, you recognize that it meets up with the space you've already been. And then everybody got. Oh, there isn't that one in there. Yeah. I will roll a perception check. And we'll see if they hear you.
Cletus Cobbington 00:47:34 Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 00:47:41 Sure, I've got a real sweet role.
Cyrus Schwert 00:47:43 I just find that one would go to 60.
Dungeon Master 00:47:58 I'll do it with disadvantage. Oh, something there, Proficienten. With disadvantage.
Dungeon Master 00:48:22 They got a 12 and a 12 for 17 total. So everybody would be able to get through the room because he was the last to move through the space with his roll order. So you guys could all clear into the next hallway, but as soon as Cyrus enters that space, I'll let you know how he kind of screws that up.
Dungeon Master 00:48:48 But who, where do you guys, do you guys want to keep going or just go right into the combat as soon as it happens?
Kaladen Shash 00:48:55 Just go into the combat.
Dungeon Master 00:48:59 Okay. First thing that happens, you don't get your surprise round because as you guys are sort of getting ready to get into space, Cyrus isn't used to using his sword as like a regular weapon. He's got it sort of holstered in his belt and he hits the doorway. So he like walks through and just all loud clangs, like rings out in the space. And the first thing you guys have long rested
Cletus Cobbington 00:49:13 Oh, God. 17.
Cyrus Schwert 00:49:21 Fifteen.
Dungeon Master 00:49:24 So as soon as these creatures wake up, you hear this droning buzz start as soon as their wings begin moving. I need everybody to give me a constitution saving throw. 17 passes. Sorry, I'll get a 19 that passes. 15 passes.
Leopold Magnus 00:49:50 10.
Kaladen Shash 00:49:53 Why don't you?
Dungeon Master 00:49:54 10 fail, 22 passes. The only one in the group to be affected by this, all of you, you were prepared for it from before, but Leopold had been a little distracted walking into the space, seeing that he wasn't the loudest one for the first time. And the droning catches you off guard, Leopold, as your helmet begins to rattle. You fall into unconsciousness from the sheer vibration it causes you. You all see that Leopold drops unconscious.
Dungeon Master 00:50:24 and then go ahead and roll the initiative.
Cletus Cobbington 00:50:31 My initiative sucks.
Kaladen Shash 00:50:38 Burn them all at the wrong time. There's another net 20. Like I said, I was like, golly, again, we're on the wrong stuff, on the wrong stuff.
Dungeon Master 00:50:54 Okay, okay. Up first, Kaladin with a 25. So then that 20 was... It was! You're so quiet about that one. Damn. Yes. 15 feet.
Kaladen Shash 00:51:08 All right. They're up on the ceiling, correct? How tall is the ceiling? They were resistant to fire, right? They have a lot of carapace and stuff.
Dungeon Master 00:51:32 You would remember they were resistant to fire and cold and they are immune to poison.
Kaladen Shash 00:51:41 Of course they are. Of course they are. Uhm? Let's cast. I was trying to give her a ring of the grammarian type thing. I got nothing.
Kaladen Shash 00:52:12 I'll do three esopteric blasts on the one that's just closest to me. I guess it's the one right here. I'm on ruler, sorry. This one. So first one. 15. 11. Okay. So two of them hit.
Dungeon Master 00:52:13 Okay. Okay. Uh, 15 just hit. 11 misses. Roll your damage.
Kaladen Shash 00:52:43 Oh, I just want to do 10 14 total. Um, and then.
Dungeon Master 00:52:57 14 total. Makes that easy math. You could jump into it.
Kaladen Shash 00:53:12 Are they within reach of an attack? Yeah, long sword. I'll just jump and stab right up at it. It's like that hits. This is the slashing and then this will be. Radiant on the second roll.
Dungeon Master 00:53:32 Yeah, for sure. Nine damage. No, I don't see it, but I'll take your word for it.
Kaladen Shash 00:53:43 It's nine, I don't know why it's taking so long to land. Yeah, on the first part, does that come through? That's all right. And then this is the other part of it, the radiant side. Four more. Oh, OK, we'll do that one. That's what came through. Take it.
Dungeon Master 00:54:03 Oh, it says 13 for the first. And then four more. OK, anything else, sir?
Cyrus Schwert 00:54:09 Bye.
Kaladen Shash 00:54:12 Oh, that's with the plus 7, yeah, OK. No, I will, because I jumped instead, I will continue to move a little bit further this way. That's my turn.
Dungeon Master 00:54:37 All righty, all righty. Up next is this other Kazmay. Seeing that you've separated yourself from the group, you see it kind of swarms in. And these guys, if you remember, are not terribly scary. They only have one attack. And I think a natural two is going to miss. That is a seven total. After that, it is Cyrus.
Cletus Cobbington 00:54:44 Silence.
Kaladen Shash 00:55:00 in a mess.
Cyrus Schwert 00:55:03 He said bug. So he's like more towards the ground around Caledon now.
Dungeon Master 00:55:14 He's still in the ceiling. You notice that these creatures are large enough, and they have spider climb, that when they're on the ceiling they can get within melee distance, but running underneath them doesn't seem to provoke opportunity attacks because they're inherently more than, like, the five feet away.
Cyrus Schwert 00:55:34 Okay. Um. Can I hit him? Or am I too far away? If I were to jump and swing something.
Dungeon Master 00:55:52 from where you are right here? Yes, you guys can take your attacks without penalty. It was just more fun to put them on the ceiling. How many did you get?
Cyrus Schwert 00:56:04 OK, and I will do that. For sure. I will go over to Kaladin and swing at the one that was attacking him. There you go. There you go. I swing twice as well. So there's the first one. Oh, I didn't hit.
Dungeon Master 00:56:26 21 hits on the first one. Did you roll? You get a D6 force damage on each of those.
Cyrus Schwert 00:56:37 10 damage on the first one. 20 to hit on the second. 11 more, 21 total. All right, so add five.
Kaladen Shash 00:57:00 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:57:00 So 21 and then 26 total. Looking pretty good. Oh, that was the other one. Hold on. OK, nice. We pulled you up.
Cyrus Schwert 00:57:09 And I just swing at it. Oh, it's a big bug! He's a weird fly, he looks like he wants to suck me!
Cletus Cobbington 00:57:11 Kill it. That ain't no horsefly. Kill it. Stomp it.
Leopold Magnus 00:57:31 I am unconscious. Unless I woke up somehow. I think you're technically required to tell it what to do. So I didn't really get a chance to do that. I'm guessing no, unless he's attacked.
Dungeon Master 00:57:34 Yes, and you were unassisted. No, you are unconscious. That is the end of your term. Would your Steel Defender act without orders from you? Okay, so he's just holding until he gets attacked.
Cyrus Schwert 00:57:39 Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:58:03 Zariel will make Jesse useful. You see Zariel jabs you with just the point of his staff. He does one point of damage, which is the minimum that he can do intentionally, and you rise from being unconscious. Unfortunately, it was after your turn, but then Cletus, it is your turn.
Cletus Cobbington 00:58:26 All right Is this one closest to me damage at all or is it just the one over by Cyrus and
Dungeon Master 00:58:35 And Zarya will move into this doorway over here to play support. Both are looking pretty comparable. They're not exactly the same damage, but they both take in a pretty good portion.
Cletus Cobbington 00:58:56 All right, well, I'm just gonna bonus action Shillelagh, my staff. And then take a swing at it. Okay. Oh. Retain. Come on.
Dungeon Master 00:59:06 And you're so tall that when you stand up straight and have your staff at the end of your hand, you could scrape the ceiling no problem. So you don't have to jump or anything dumb like that. Your friends look like fools. 18 hits. And looking more hurt but not dead. Anything else?
Cletus Cobbington 00:59:26 10 damage. I think that's all I can do. That's my...
Dungeon Master 00:59:45 Okay, up next is this Kazmay. It'll take its attack on you because you're the only one there. I don't know that I've hit a single time on this one. 13 to hit. Really? Okay, you take...
Cletus Cobbington 00:59:59 I believe, yep, that's my AC. That hits me. Yes. I can't wear much good armor. Oof!
Dungeon Master 01:00:13 20 piercing damage with 26 necrotic damage and your hit point maximum is reduced by 26. Until something else happens, yes.
Kaladen Shash 01:00:13 Oh, he roll, rolling heavy. Yahtzee. For the rest of the day. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:00:15 Damn. What the fuck? I wish she could heal too.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:15 Oh.
Cletus Cobbington 01:00:33 Wait, my full health is lowered by 26 for the rest? I see. Right. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:00:38 Yes, so when you get healed, you can only get healed to 26 under what you're normal. It doesn't do an additional 26. It's not like you're taking 52.
Kaladen Shash 01:00:47 Good. Oh.
Cyrus Schwert 01:00:51 William, no! You got fucked!
Dungeon Master 01:00:55 You see, it's the only time this has ever landed, but he's just so big that Cletus hits it, gets its attention, and then he's basically standing eye level with it. And it just injects him in the throat with its proboscis. And this huge pulse of dark energy goes into your body as you shrivel up and your limbs get gaunt and thin and sinewy. You look instantly so hurt. And this thing, I don't think it heals or anything from that.
Dungeon Master 01:01:25 No, but it looks, it looks good. Like it looks like it enjoys that a little bit. At the very top of that calendar.
Cletus Cobbington 01:01:32 I'm a cow, not a horse, you damn fly.
Cyrus Schwert 01:01:36 F5, reverse key.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:39 I'll go ahead and having seen this I'll go ahead and point back over to where Cletus was getting attacked and shoot my blast at this guy. First one's gonna miss, I think 11. Second one's gonna hit at 18. Third one's gonna hit.
Dungeon Master 01:01:56 First one misses. 18 hits. 23 hits. Okay, two of three hit. That's pretty good.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:07 Yeah, 2D10. That's force damage right there. 17. And then I will, I will jump up and. Stab this one again, the one right in front of me with light splitter. Oh, Yahtzee.
Cyrus Schwert 01:02:15 Nice. Peace.
Dungeon Master 01:02:29 Go for it. Natural 20. Obviously hits. 30-30. You're sticking Jesse's place. Yeah, everything.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:39 Damn, dude. Saves time for the rest of us.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:42 Yeah, I noticed that. I think that's four of them tonight just for me. Ridiculous, so that's going to be 2D8 plus. Does the bonus modifier also double? OK, plus 14. Plus 2D6.
Kaladen Shash 01:03:13 Little soft. Got this one now. 30. Someone finish them.
Dungeon Master 01:03:19 Huge hit. Looked very hurt. Okay, up next is the Kazumi that's right next to you. You do this huge amount of damage. It turns to you and it's going to do its attack again. 23 to hit.
Cyrus Schwert 01:03:24 Good. I'll try. Shit. Against two?
Cletus Cobbington 01:03:30 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:03:50 It's not even worse field meets it beats it gonna it's gonna hit It's gonna hit me with that necrotic crap Okay
Dungeon Master 01:03:55 Okay, you take 21 points of piercing damage plus 27 points of necrotic damage, and your maximum hit points are reduced by 27. I'm nasty with it. You see, it rubs its little fly hands together, just so content with what it did. Cyrus, you were up after that.
Cyrus Schwert 01:04:05 Oh my god. I am just as scared as could be. After watching that the life gets sucked out of.
Cyrus Schwert 01:04:34 The guy who just rolled into four and had 20s. But I am an adventurer, and I have to keep going. I'm going to swing at him again. The one I'm next to. I'm not going to leave this space. I imagine that way. Sorry, I have to unroll in a separate...
Dungeon Master 01:04:37 Okay. 25 hits. That's all right. 15, and then two half to one, so 16 damage total.
Cyrus Schwert 01:05:06 Dang. I'll swing again. Uh-oh. 14? Shit! Okay. That's not good.
Dungeon Master 01:05:06 That's on death's door. 14 misses. It'll live to fight another round.
Dungeon Master 01:05:30 Leopold, your turn. You are conscious. Take your turn as normal. You are prone, so you'll have to spend half your movement to get up, but other than that, you are free to do anything. Yeah, two people look incredibly fucked up.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:34 Whoa! What's going on, guys? Oh, oh God! Oh, get off of them! Jesus Christ, it must be another one of those sex things! I'm gonna get up. And I'm...
Cletus Cobbington 01:05:35 Woo! Ah! He's sucking me, not the good way.
Kaladen Shash 01:05:57 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:03 10 feet. Yeah, so I can use my movement to close the distance. I am going to close into this closest one here. Shout out my steel defender to move up a little bit and fire. He said, I recall that they're immune to ice and then take less fire damage.
Dungeon Master 01:06:28 They're resistant to fire and ice. Cold. Immune to poison.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:31 That's right. Resist. Resist. Yeah, cool. OK. Immune to poison. OK. So this close one, I'll just take two swings with my Searing Saber at that one. 13 to hit.
Dungeon Master 01:06:57 13 misses. 27 definitely hits. Yeah, I'm down. Incredibly hurt, but not dead. Maybe one more.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:01 Okay, 27 will hit, I'm assuming. So then on that one, it take 10 damage plus half of this fire damage, so half of three, one, I guess. 11 damage from that searing saber. How is it looking? Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:25 Then I'll yell to the steel defender to come in and attack, and it will do a force-empowered rend, which is... Minus stat block. There it is. 17. 17 hits, all right. And it'll take eight damage from that strike.
Dungeon Master 01:07:36 17 hits. How does your steel defender finish it?
Cletus Cobbington 01:07:45 Tf, why don't you do that shit?
Cyrus Schwert 01:07:56 Mordra, but I- Yes.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:59 Yeah, so after Leopold strikes with a saber, he yells out, finish it, Bone Crusher. And Bone Crusher mechanically marches very stiffly up and quite slowly and ratchets its sword all the way back in here. Click, click, click, click, click, click. And that kind of locks in place. And then almost lightning speed, it just slices and the bug falls in two parts.
Dungeon Master 01:08:14 As soon as this steel defender gets a kill, everybody in the room, you feel this like presence of an unseen aura sort of
Dungeon Master 01:08:39 billow out of the steel defender. The only way you can describe it is kind of evil. It feels dark. Leopold, in the most posterior recess of your mind, you remember a sensation like this when you watched your brother kill somebody in a training once. And then you've got no connection to that memory. It just pops out of nowhere.
Dungeon Master 01:09:08 After that, it is Zariel's turn. Both of you are looking real hurt. He will... It's on random. Don't listen too much to it.
Kaladen Shash 01:09:08 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:09:21 Like that music. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:09:30 Yeah, I healed. I healed already.
Dungeon Master 01:09:34 Trace has the party. Have you done the healing spells yet? Do they know you have that capability? Okay, you see Zario looks to you and goes, take care of yourself. I got my friend and he looks over to Cal and he goes, Cal, this one's for you. And he hits you with another third level healing word. You heal for...
Kaladen Shash 01:09:41 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:10:06 22 points of healing. Okay. That's bonus action. He will... Action. He can't do a spell. He will... He can't. Okay. That's what he can do. Next up, Cletus. Your turn.
Kaladen Shash 01:10:11 OK.
Cletus Cobbington 01:10:36 All right. Let's see. Well, that fucking hurt. So I'm going to... First, I'll do a little bonus action. Second, a little healing word on myself. All that.
Dungeon Master 01:10:48 Yeah, I didn't realize those were so nasty. They only have a plus five to hit, but it hits hard.
Cletus Cobbington 01:11:04 Pull 12-er back to me. Then I'll saunter on over and swing at the other one with my staff. 16? 11? Oh shit.
Dungeon Master 01:11:19 15 hits. Cletus, finish it. You teabag it. The plopping sound as they hit each time.
Cletus Cobbington 01:11:30 Your friend sucked me but I'm about to fuck you and I smack it with a staff off the ceiling. And I teabag it. I have massive cow balls. Alright.
Kaladen Shash 01:11:43 you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:11:48 Well-changed.
Dungeon Master 01:11:54 And you guys have a moment in between. You do notice that, as was sort of brought up as a concern, when these last creature dies, you do not see any sort of pedestal rise out of this room.
Cletus Cobbington 01:12:14 Shit. Cyrus, you fuck. Why'd you drop your sword? Here's some crisp, warm almond milk.
Kaladen Shash 01:12:15 That's all.
Cyrus Schwert 01:12:19 It's big. I don't know how to use it. How much... How much is this? Fuck you. That's crazy. It can't be crisp and warm. It can't.
Leopold Magnus 01:12:25 Oh, Cyrus, you're looking a little pale. Are you feeling all right there, champ?
Dungeon Master 01:12:37 Crisp, warm, off-milk. Those words don't go together.
Cletus Cobbington 01:12:45 All right. I've seen better days, but I'm not too bad.
Cyrus Schwert 01:12:54 Um, help. Are you so hurt? cleanest? I'm gonna cast the healing word on you.
Leopold Magnus 01:13:08 Jonathan, what were those? She's asking if I could snag the proboscis from one of those creatures throughout my inventory.
Dungeon Master 01:13:11 You see that as you focus your attention on them, being a part of this sort of ritual sequence, as soon as these creatures die, as with anything, you realize that you don't even have to make the check. Anytime you kill one of them, the creatures sort of dissolve into the ground.
Leopold Magnus 01:13:39 But the pedestal did not come up in this case. Got it.
Dungeon Master 01:13:39 And then once the creature is gone, the pedestal comes up. Yes. Let me tell you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:13:50 How long does the decreased max HP last? Right.
Cyrus Schwert 01:13:59 It's a long rest. I cast Healing Word on you.
Dungeon Master 01:14:08 This reduction to a creature's hit point maximum lasts until the creature finishes a long rest or until it is affected by a spell like Greater Restoration. How much do you heal them for?
Cyrus Schwert 01:14:31 so I can use some of my skills. Let's see, 19.
Dungeon Master 01:14:40 Might be.
Cletus Cobbington 01:14:43 Okay, well I don't get to use some of that, but that does get me up to my full. Thank you. Wow, you're a better healer than me. What level did you do? Is that third level? I see. That works. Alright, anybody else? Anyone else hurting?
Cyrus Schwert 01:15:04 Yeah. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:15:20 All right, let's get on after it then.
Kaladen Shash 01:15:28 Yes, what's in this hallway? What do we see? Into the rooms. No, you just explained, you just showed us. Do we see anything in this room?
Dungeon Master 01:15:38 Which one? This connects down to the path that you guys have been on previously. Just looks like this was the one room you hadn't been in yet.
Cletus Cobbington 01:15:57 We're missing two orbs, right? Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:16:01 Correct. Missing number 3, number 10. I think the blood room might have number 10 in it.
Cyrus Schwert 01:16:12 So there was the pedestal with one missing in the blood room. And there's another door kind of close to that that we didn't go through. How do you make those circles when you're like pointing?
Cletus Cobbington 01:16:30 All right, back to the blood. I was wondering the same thing. I think this one, right? Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:16:36 Just double click on a spot. Where's the door you're talking about? What door did we miss? That's the exit door. We don't have all the things we need to get out.
Dungeon Master 01:16:38 That's the big one.
Cyrus Schwert 01:16:43 Let's see. Okay, thank you. Isn't there one right there? Got it.
Cletus Cobbington 01:17:01 Was this hole way down over here? That's the end of a hole? Okay. Very skinny. Alright, well. Let's run to the blood.
Dungeon Master 01:17:06 there was a key in there at one point.
Kaladen Shash 01:17:06 That's just room. It's long, skinny room.
Cyrus Schwert 01:17:16 Do we have to go in the blood room? Oh. I'm scared. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:17:27 I think we do have to go into the blood room.
Dungeon Master 01:17:46 As you guys. Give me a perception check. I'll let you know. 3020 you do see that like.
Cletus Cobbington 01:17:47 Does the blood all look the same or is there some little oil juice from my robotic friends in there too? Okay. Dirty 20.
Dungeon Master 01:18:11 They're looking really hard again it's really low light in here so you sort of light it up a little bit with like an overhead view with like a torch or however you want to present some sort of light source and you see there is a faintest evidence of like an iridescent sheen.
Cletus Cobbington 01:18:24 Seems like this is all the blood to get in the room, not necessarily killed and whatnot. I dipped my toesie in the door.
Cyrus Schwert 01:18:39 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:18:51 You open the door, same thing. There is a sort of stepping space where you don't have to step directly into the blood yet. There's like, there's a place to look in. And then, yeah, so you don't see anything new. So unless you were dipping your toe in, it's all you see. You guys watch as soon as Cletus, his little tiny pinky toe touches.
Cletus Cobbington 01:19:01 Hmm. I would like to dip my little pinky toe. Ew.
Dungeon Master 01:19:20 the the blood uh arising at the far end of the room exactly mirror of him you see not the steel defender you see i don't think i can copy you guys
Cletus Cobbington 01:19:32 both.
Dungeon Master 01:19:40 We'll just use the Steel Defender as it. I'll get it. You see an exact copy of Cletus, but just non-discernible details exactly of it. It looks like him, but blood version, but it doesn't move. It's, you dip your toe, it touches this thing, rises up at the far side of the room, exactly across from you. And it's, as long as you were still, it is also still.
Cletus Cobbington 01:20:04 Dad? Pop? All right. Well, I want to dunk Chip's little toe in there, too. No, it's OK. All right, well, now there be fake me.
Kaladen Shash 01:20:07 Why, why there another one of you in there? What's going on?
Cyrus Schwert 01:20:08 Oh, cool.
Cletus Cobbington 01:20:34 I guess I have a blood twin. Can I do a little robot shimmy? Oh, wait. Sorry. Is that offensive to my compatriots?
Kaladen Shash 01:20:37 When you moved, does it move, or what happened? What's it just standing there for?
Dungeon Master 01:20:44 It doesn't seem to exactly mirror you, but you see that when you physically move forward, like if you were to like lean, it closes the space, but sort of side to side movement doesn't seem to make a huge difference. You can give me insight checks if you want to do anything like that.
Kaladen Shash 01:21:07 And then when you back.
Cyrus Schwert 01:21:11 You got this, Cletus, and I give you a verdict.
Cletus Cobbington 01:21:13 Yeah, I'll do. All right. Sorry, was I doing a perception check? Or what check did you say? Insight. OK. 16.
Dungeon Master 01:21:23 insight check to sort of figure out what's going on. 16. Now, it seems like another challenge type scenario. 16 doesn't give you all the details, but it gives you enough. The closer you sort of get to the center of the room where sort of the pedestal splits it, it seems like your mirrored form closes the distance at the same.
Dungeon Master 01:21:52 pace. It doesn't seem to necessarily exactly copy you, just it's distance-based.
Cletus Cobbington 01:21:59 All right. Does anyone else want to come in with me or should I go up to the... Yeah, face yourself.
Kaladen Shash 01:22:05 And then the ins... I'll step, let me step in. I'll step in with you. And then the inscription over the door was, face yourself to move forward. What was it exactly? I stick my shoe into the blood. What happens?
Dungeon Master 01:22:23 face yourself to move forward. You see exactly across from you, exactly the same as soon as you make contact with the floor, a figure that resembles you, but just a little bit more amorphous, a little bit more just blood shape, but discernibly you in place doesn't seem to move forward unless you move.
Cletus Cobbington 01:22:53 You got a twin too, huh?
Kaladen Shash 01:22:56 It looks like it as I if if I notice it moves with me, does it look like it has some sort of malicious intent as I get closer to the pedestal? Not the greatest.
Dungeon Master 01:23:07 Give me an insight check. 14 doesn't look malicious, necessarily. Not with a 14.
Dungeon Master 01:23:35 Again, it seems like you, so part of you wonders, is it my intent going to affect its intent? How exactly does it work? Again, you notice that slight side-to-side movements, you could tell it's sort of mirroring, but it's not exact. It's really when you close distance, it matches that. Nothing else has really been revealed yet. You back up, it backs up.
Kaladen Shash 01:23:56 When I back up, does it also? If I back up? Okay. Anyone have any ideas? I don't know what to do. Just a blood twin. Can I? Can you interact with it?
Cyrus Schwert 01:24:10 I don't know either. Try to shake his hand. Maybe being nice helps.
Cletus Cobbington 01:24:16 I can saunter on up to the middle and see if it wants to hurt me. Well, assumingly, he's got the same as me. Can I have Chip go on and run on? No, I don't want to kill him.
Kaladen Shash 01:24:25 You don't have very much. Yeah. It's OK, buddy.
Cyrus Schwert 01:24:46 You had to kill your squirrel.
Cletus Cobbington 01:24:49 Sorry, Chip, I didn't mean that. I don't know. I think the only thing we can do is just have someone go up and check.
Dungeon Master 01:24:55 As you hit about the center of the room, you see
Kaladen Shash 01:24:58 Yes. I'm going to go right up to the middle of the pedestal, and I will interact. Can I put my hand out? Let's just reach out to me.
Dungeon Master 01:25:15 It gets to a point, like the five feet surrounding the pedestal, where as soon as you enter that space, the room sort of glows a little red and the figure that was you starts acting more independently. Go ahead and roll an attack against your own armor class as it reaches out to attack you.
Kaladen Shash 01:25:47 Pre six. I was attacking myself. Darn, I thought I was attacking it. I rolled against me. Not that I was rolling against it. That's what you were narrating. Yeah, when it got no. Right when he got red and everything, I think I thought you told me to swing at it.
Dungeon Master 01:25:49 Uh, it hits you. Go ahead and roll damage. It's attacking you. Unless you want to attack it. No, unless you intended to attack it as soon as you broke that space right in the center, it got violent towards you. No.
Dungeon Master 01:26:18 Unless you think you would have. Not for us.
Kaladen Shash 01:26:18 I'll tell you, I'll take this first step. That's fine. I've got so much, so much life to give. Did that show? It's not, it's just quivering. Let me roll it again.
Cletus Cobbington 01:26:29 Must be Cyrus again.
Cyrus Schwert 01:26:43 What quivered?
Kaladen Shash 01:26:51 Is that one? So 17 total. OK. Did it take the full damage or half of it?
Dungeon Master 01:26:54 13. So when it attacks you, you see that it gets hurt as well. You take half of that. 17, yeah, reduced to 8. It looks like it takes the full damage.
Cyrus Schwert 01:27:14 So it hit you and it took the full damage?
Kaladen Shash 01:27:23 OK, fascinating. Yeah, but it got me for. Half of the damage, but it took full. I guess it when it attacks it. It takes the full brunt and we take half of it. Don't understand.
Cyrus Schwert 01:27:45 Is that going to happen to us if we swing it? Maybe, but we're also the real version.
Cletus Cobbington 01:27:46 And it probably works the same. Where we hit it, it takes half. We hurt ourselves for full.
Dungeon Master 01:27:56 Go ahead and just roll initiative so we can get an order of operations. You see Zariel goes, yeah, it seems like those who enter the room enter the trial. So I'm going to stay out here unless you guys really need me.
Kaladen Shash 01:27:56 Oh. That's interesting. OK.
Cletus Cobbington 01:28:19 All right. Yeah, we got two in here. Let's see what happens. Y'all can stay back probably.
Cyrus Schwert 01:28:21 All right.
Kaladen Shash 01:28:27 Enjoy the show.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:34 You guys got this?
Dungeon Master 01:28:47 Okay, Cyrus, you are up first. You have not entered the space yet. Okay, as soon as you enter the room, you see a copy of you is created.
Cyrus Schwert 01:28:51 first. I'm going to enter. I'm going to stay towards the back of the room. Good, good. I'm glad I wasn't left out. Let's see.
Kaladen Shash 01:29:14 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:29:31 Hmm. Sorry. Oh, no. I don't want to go up there and have, like, is my guy only going to attack me? Or is it going to like, I just don't want him to go rogue. And right now,
Dungeon Master 01:29:42 All good, okay. You don't know? Yes, he's the only one that's approached.
Cyrus Schwert 01:30:01 Kaladin is the only one right there, right? Okay. I'm going to hold an action and wait. I don't know. I'm just going to wait and hold the action until we figure out more, maybe.
Cletus Cobbington 01:30:04 Mm-hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:30:05 We are.
Dungeon Master 01:30:30 OK. You see that your copy doesn't move. Are you just sort of back here nearing Cletus? OK, cool. I'm just going to have it. Perfect. OK. After you, Cletus.
Cyrus Schwert 01:30:41 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:30:48 All right, so when Kaladin walked up to the middle, that five foot radius right, that's what triggered him, his clone to be violent. Okay. For science's sake, I wanna walk towards mine, but like on the outer edge there.
Dungeon Master 01:30:58 Yeah, like towards the center, it seemed to stop just sort of the walking thing and got aggressive. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:31:17 not to get into the middle and try to meet up with my homie clone in the outside. Still just chillin'. Alright, for also science sake, I'ma smack it. I'ma just gonna do... Let's see.
Dungeon Master 01:31:27 You do that. Nothing happens. OK, rolled a hit.
Cletus Cobbington 01:31:47 I'm just going to do an unarmed strike just to see what the damage looks like. Okay, well that hit. Like total or my... Oh, plus one.
Dungeon Master 01:31:56 22 hits. What's your strength for? Yeah, what's your modifier? You do 1 damage, and since it's a minimum of 1, it takes 1 damage and you take 1 damage.
Kaladen Shash 01:31:59 It's just standing there, you just sucker punch it.
Cyrus Schwert 01:32:08 just to modify it.
Cletus Cobbington 01:32:19 OK, well, that was a bad test. All right. Well, that didn't exactly go exactly how I wanted it. We just bitch slapped each other, and here we are. All right. OK. Whoa. Hey now, partner.
Dungeon Master 01:32:30 As soon as you strike it and
Kaladen Shash 01:32:38 You can see if it slapped you back, you're shocked by it.
Cyrus Schwert 01:32:41 And now here we are. It's a good quote.
Dungeon Master 01:32:53 Um it mirrors you so as you hit it it hits you so go ahead and roll uh and since you did an arm strike rolling on arm strike against yourself 23 hits you you do one more damage both ways
Cletus Cobbington 01:33:01 Right. Okay. I'm rolling good against myself. Oops. All right. Well, this isn't the best test, but it seems like
Cletus Cobbington 01:33:26 Outside the middle, the damage is the same. All right. Confused and left not much smarter. I end my turn. Yes, do you notice anything? I see.
Dungeon Master 01:33:27 You see Chip is stroking his little squirrel beard.
Cyrus Schwert 01:33:36 Is that really the conclusion you're getting at?
Cletus Cobbington 01:33:57 All right. Oh, I actually can hear him now. He says I'm stupid as shit.
Dungeon Master 01:33:58 and and if you could speak the same language as him, what you hear is you **** stupid **** and he's like, keep it on here and explaining it but you can't hear it. Oh, you hear him. He's going, well, I figured it out while you were sort of just wandering around what I think is going on and what I'm pretty sure is going on. If you think about it this
Kaladen Shash 01:34:11 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:34:27 The damage that you did a little bit like what happened was is that you just like the bare minimum So you both look the same but in theory you would take half anyway Right, that's because you were an idiot and you used your fist when you're not a fist Well, I don't want to argue about this right now I think we've established Thank you
Cletus Cobbington 01:34:35 Didn't you see that we did the same damage though, Chip? I think. Well, I didn't want to hurt myself that bad. Alright, I give him an almond and stuff him in my pocket. Alright. I'm done.
Dungeon Master 01:34:58 So count it at your go. OK, roll to hit.
Kaladen Shash 01:35:02 For the sake of experimentation, I will swing at it. It's rolling really slow. Yahtzee? I'm worried.
Dungeon Master 01:35:27 Natural 20. Okay, go ahead and roll normal damage.
Kaladen Shash 01:35:35 It's not going to roll right. The 2D6 didn't go in there. That's 24 plus 6, a clean 30.
Dungeon Master 01:36:03 30. You take 15. And it seems to look incredibly hurt at this. At the same time that you hit it, it attacks you. Go ahead and roll an attack on yourself. Pretty sure. 28. Go ahead and roll damage on yourself.
Kaladen Shash 01:36:14 Motherfucker. All right, but it's going to take damage again, right? Yes. Let's hit. 28 always hits. Right.
Cletus Cobbington 01:36:38 Silence.
Dungeon Master 01:36:49 Okay, you take 15, you take, you'll take seven more damage. And you see that as you sort of hit each other, it explodes into blood and just disappears into the ground. And you have defeated your blood club.
Kaladen Shash 01:36:54 That's not bad. 15. In this. My splash.
Leopold Magnus 01:36:55 Aladin, quit hitting yourself!
Dungeon Master 01:37:18 It's gone, yeah. OK.
Kaladen Shash 01:37:22 Just have to kill it, just hear it. I'm gonna, I'm just gonna take a little bit of movement and just step backwards a little. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:37:30 Just keep punching it.
Dungeon Master 01:37:49 What does Cyrus do, Travis? Full sprint, you guys. Collide in the center. Go ahead and roll an attack. Then go ahead and while you're at it, roll a second attack on yourself. Yes, so.
Cyrus Schwert 01:37:55 I'm going to run up there and swing at my guy knowing this new knowledge. The middle. It's separate. I see.
Dungeon Master 01:38:16 There always is damage exchange with each hit, but it attacks you separately than you attack it. 15. You miss. Go ahead and roll an attack on yourself. 17 hits. Go ahead and roll damage on yourself.
Cyrus Schwert 01:38:25 Well, I didn't hit it. And here comes against myself. And that does hit me. So that's cool. OK, got it.
Cletus Cobbington 01:38:32 Oh, shit.
Kaladen Shash 01:38:43 Hurt yourself, sir.
Dungeon Master 01:38:47 You take seven and it takes 14. You got it. 16, you're here. 11 more plus.
Cyrus Schwert 01:38:54 And now I do that again for the second attack. Got it. I understand. Perfect. I actually hit it just barely. Just barely. I got to roll a d6 with this. I'm going to roll it in real life. It's pissing me off. One more. 12.
Cletus Cobbington 01:39:01 Maybe hit the clone this time.
Dungeon Master 01:39:22 Okay, you take 6 damage. Really hit? Okay, you take 10 more damage.
Cyrus Schwert 01:39:30 And I have to roll against myself again. It really hit me. Nice. And then I'll roll a d6 plus 5. God damn it. 14. I guess that's fine. It does more anyway. OK. That will do it.
Kaladen Shash 01:39:46 That's good. That's good. Yeah, it takes more. You take half. Bleeding.
Dungeon Master 01:39:55 It's looking pretty hurt. If blood could look hurt, it looks hurt. Cletus, you're up.
Cletus Cobbington 01:40:03 Oh, I punch it now. Would it be fair to assume that since I activated this clone, the only way to beat it or dissipate it would be to kill it? Like if I left the room, would it also disappear?
Cyrus Schwert 01:40:29 It's not far, you might as well try.
Dungeon Master 01:40:30 You don't? No, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna say you don't know. But also, it doesn't seem, it seems like the ones from the people who didn't join in the room, like Leopold and Zariel, there's not, their blood clones didn't activate. So you don't know how it works necessarily. Lately.
Cletus Cobbington 01:40:36 Hmm Right, all right, well Well, I'm just gonna smack it but with my actual fucking thing this time Yeah
Dungeon Master 01:40:58 Go ahead, same thing, roll an attack against it, and then roll an attack against yourself. You miss it. It hits you, yeah. And you take four, it takes eight.
Kaladen Shash 01:41:07 Well, but you just. Big swings, big swings.
Cletus Cobbington 01:41:09 And then this is it at me. It hits me though. All right, that's fine. All right. I mean, I'm the only one that hasn't killed it, right? Should I just...
Cletus Cobbington 01:41:40 Okay. I mean, that's, yeah. Oh, okay. Okay. Yep. All right. That's what I got.
Dungeon Master 01:41:41 No, Cyrus is a. Cal it is your turn. OK.
Cyrus Schwert 01:41:43 I'm still alive.
Kaladen Shash 01:41:43 Yeah. Uhm, I'm gonna hang out and I'm gonna cast a false life on myself. I'll just do it at second level.
Dungeon Master 01:42:11 You cast False Life on yourself. You see nothing happens. It doesn't reform or anything with the regained hit points. And then up at the top it'll be your turn, Cyrus. Okay. Roll the four attacks. Every other one is yours and the other ones are its. 25 hits it.
Cyrus Schwert 01:42:24 Okay. I just keep swinging at him. I try to I try to fuck him. There's one. That doesn't hit. Good. 18 hits.
Dungeon Master 01:42:42 13 misses you, you miss it. And then we're one in. Okay, you. Oh, so that. Okay. It hits you, you hit it. And again, you can just roll all of your dice. Normal, that's how you prefer.
Kaladen Shash 01:42:47 you
Cyrus Schwert 01:42:55 So I did two. Two of them hit. OK. If this doesn't work. It's gone.
Cyrus Schwert 01:43:26 It's taking a very long time. And then that's plus 16. 30.
Kaladen Shash 01:43:35 17.
Dungeon Master 01:43:42 OK, we'll have to separate it out, because it'll be. 4 plus 4 and then 8 plus one and plus the modifier in each because one is you rolled and you hit it and then it rolled and it missed and then you rolled and you missed and then it rolled and it hit. So it was a one attack each. So what is the modifier on each of your tax? It's. Plus 7.
Cyrus Schwert 01:44:05 Got it. 8.
Dungeon Master 01:44:10 8. Okay, so 8, so 16 damage to it. So you would take 8 damage, it takes 16, and then it does 9 plus 8, 17 damage. So you would take 8 and it would take 17 more. Okay, I got it. I made that really hard for myself. Oh, how do you, it, on the exchange, same thing happened before.
Dungeon Master 01:44:40 You sort of are going back and forth hitting each other and it explodes and the blood flows into nothing and disappears. Yes. After that it's Cletus.
Cletus Cobbington 01:44:45 Oh.
Cyrus Schwert 01:44:48 Did it need both attacks to kill it? Or would it have? OK. Got it. Yeah, I just splash it down. I look frightened, as per usual. And that's me.
Cletus Cobbington 01:45:09 All right, back to the slow and steady. Smack at it again. 30, 20. Container.
Kaladen Shash 01:45:10 Silence.
Cyrus Schwert 01:45:18 to white vans.
Dungeon Master 01:45:22 30-20 hits. You take 5, it takes 10. It's looking real hurt. Roll an attack for it to hit you. It hits you, roll damage. 8, you take 4, it takes 8. It's looking very hurt.
Cletus Cobbington 01:45:36 It's me. Come on, just be a big number. That's not a big number. I just don't have the image output. We have to face ourselves.
Kaladen Shash 01:45:53 I'm wondering if that's right. Like, will I hurt him and other dude takes no damage? I'm worried. I'll just hold my action.
Dungeon Master 01:45:55 After that, Caledon. What's the time?
Cyrus Schwert 01:45:59 Go hit his thing. I already got it.
Cletus Cobbington 01:46:11 He'll kill me. I already got sucked. Don't do it.
Dungeon Master 01:46:29 Oh, sorry, I have to ask. Kaladin, at the end of the round, would you like to use your health option? Yeah. Okay. Sarys, your turn.
Kaladen Shash 01:46:35 Oh, I was at the bottom. I didn't realize that. No, I'm good. Thank you. Good.
Cyrus Schwert 01:46:59 Thank you. Get after it. Can you hear me? Hello?
Cletus Cobbington 01:47:03 Didn't hear that.
Dungeon Master 01:47:03 Paul? I think I'm hearing like every other phrasing.
Kaladen Shash 01:47:27 You're coming in better. Where you be?
Cyrus Schwert 01:47:31 I'm going to click this, whap at it still. Let's kick the video.
Cletus Cobbington 01:47:34 Okay, he's passing it on to me, I think he's saying. Macken, come on. I've never wanted to kill myself until this moment. Come on, it's dead.
Dungeon Master 01:47:40 Okay. Go. 15 hits. 11 damage. You take five and then go ahead and as you hit and it hits, it disappears enough with just that, you defeat yourself.
Kaladen Shash 01:48:00 the light, the lightening.
Cletus Cobbington 01:48:09 Jesus Christ, I need some almond milk after that, that sucked. So I guess it still would have helped a little bit, but.
Dungeon Master 01:48:14 Um, the trick to that is if you guys attacked each other's, it wouldn't attack at the same time. So instead of doing two attacks every single time, it'd be just the half damage each time. Okay. Yeah. So you guys finished your own, you could have attacked the other persons and I just love that. Sure. Like, Nope. Hey, wait,
Kaladen Shash 01:48:29 Oh, it's cool. It's cool. Face yourself. Yeah. Nope. Let him do it. He's let him do it. Let him do it all the time. He's got it.
Cyrus Schwert 01:48:35 We didn't figure that out.
Cletus Cobbington 01:48:41 it. Well, the challenge made it seem like you needed to face yourself.
Dungeon Master 01:48:44 I want to see them both up. You see the the pillar in the center on it rises out the orb. Give me everybody. Give me a perception check and that includes Leopold and Zario.
Cyrus Schwert 01:49:10 Good. Oh.
Leopold Magnus 01:49:12 Oh, looks like you took care of yourselves in there. It was a real beat off.
Kaladen Shash 01:49:16 I think I have something, something in my eye. I cannot see anything. Yeah. Darn. Yeah, just the one. We still need, we still need more. What's the number on this one?
Cletus Cobbington 01:49:21 I'm even more hurt from that fucking fly. Fuck.
Dungeon Master 01:49:22 Nobody sees anything at this time. There's just one orb in the center. The first one you see is, let's see, the one in here is three. Yes, you see the three.
Kaladen Shash 01:49:48 The first one we see. Is there another in this room? Come on, man.
Dungeon Master 01:49:53 Not that you guys noticed. What? Yes, you can get investigation check. Leopold, are you entering the room? Are you stepping into the blood? OK. You stand in the blood because it's a repeated check.
Cletus Cobbington 01:49:56 Can chip do a perception?
Leopold Magnus 01:49:58 Can I do an investigation check of the room? Go ahead. No, I'm going to stay out of the blood, best I can. All right.
Cyrus Schwert 01:50:02 You don't have to go in.
Dungeon Master 01:50:18 it's going to be adding two to the difficulty but if people aid you they can add two to whatever you need. Okay, so go ahead and roll with a plus two if anybody else wants to help them. My new house rules is for every person that aids it adds two to the roll instead of just giving advantage.
Kaladen Shash 01:50:19 I would like to aid you by telling you what I see from where I stand in the blood, OK?
Cletus Cobbington 01:50:25 Oh. I huck tip at him. Yeah. Help him tip. Point him out.
Leopold Magnus 01:50:31 Perfect. The squirrel bounces off my visor with a thud.
Cyrus Schwert 01:50:45 He turns into binoculars.
Dungeon Master 01:50:51 You see Chip looks you dead in the eyes and goes... He says, depending on what Leopold rolls... You're getting basically a plus 2 from everybody. So... 2, 4, 6, 8. So add 8 to that. That makes that...
Cletus Cobbington 01:50:58 What do you say? I can decipher.
Leopold Magnus 01:51:07 Okay, all right, I'm gonna roll it. 23, yeah. Damn.
Kaladen Shash 01:51:13 That's okay, we might have gotten there. 23, 23. Let's go!
Dungeon Master 01:51:21 23, the DC was 22, it was 20 plus an additional two. Nicely done. Leopold, you're sort of scanning through the room and we'll say that sometimes your vision being artificial sometimes phases into like different spectrums, just like very briefly before it adjusts back to the normal light range. You see
Dungeon Master 01:51:44 Reflecting perfectly down into the blood is a mirror of the pillar, and in the blood, almost if you could reach down and grab it, you see not covered in blood, but almost looks perfectly normal, an orb that seems to be set in the reflection of the pedestal.
Cletus Cobbington 01:51:54 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:52:04 Oh, nice.
Leopold Magnus 01:52:04 Yeah, I'll just point and I'll say, well, gents, looks like we may have missed something down there. Kaladin, do you think you could fish her out?
Kaladen Shash 01:52:11 Oh, oh, I will pick up the last one. What is this number 10? Is it the number I see? X on the Roman numeral? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:52:19 Yeah, your hand dips into the blood and it almost looks like it's again only a millimeter, but your hand goes all the way down to the elbow before you make contact. And you pull the orb out, dripping with blood, but somehow cleans off really quickly, almost if it there was like a residue on it, like a waxy thing, the water just sort of collects the bottom with the blood cuts at the bottom and drips off. And you have the 10th orb.
Cletus Cobbington 01:52:43 Well, good thing we ignored this room and went and got sucked. Uh...
Kaladen Shash 01:52:43 Excellent. Oh, man. Perhaps we should take another long rest before we fight the main room. I'm going to be fucking worthless without 27 hit points.
Dungeon Master 01:52:50 I know, when you guys did it, I was like, oh, shit. Craig is going to have a field day with me.
Leopold Magnus 01:52:58 Well, you did get sucked off quite a bit, Kaladin.
Cyrus Schwert 01:53:09 I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
Kaladen Shash 01:53:10 No, I did not enjoy this. It was not the good. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:53:15 I'm at a ripe 13. I would love a long rest before we go to the big scary door. Preferably not in this bloodbath though.
Dungeon Master 01:53:30 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:53:39 What? I'm already unrolling my sleeping bag. What do you mean? It's already... I don't know, it's just... I'm really tired. Like, I'm really tired. I don't do it anymore. You can see, like, I'm fucking woozy from blood loss.
Cletus Cobbington 01:53:45 There's a sleeping bag clone.
Leopold Magnus 01:53:51 Wait, you're really going to sleep in the blood there, huh?
Kaladen Shash 01:54:00 Really? Do we feel like? Do we feel like we need to retreat to a defensible room or is there like? Has there just been no other traffic in here? You know I mean? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:54:01 It's gonna be like, it's soaking wet. You haven't seen anything else. There are not, again, this place was pretty well sealed off when you entered.
Cyrus Schwert 01:54:12 It keeps falling down.
Dungeon Master 01:54:29 It doesn't seem like there are free roaming monsters. More so that is like individually set up trial routes. Yeah, what are the watch orders going to be? We can sort of speed up through it through the night.
Kaladen Shash 01:54:38 Yeah, yeah, can we just camp out in front of the main door for a long rest and then enter? I can. I'll do the first watch again. Did I have a question? I have a question with the.
Leopold Magnus 01:54:43 I can do the second.
Cletus Cobbington 01:54:53 I'm going to channel Cyrus and say, not me.
Dungeon Master 01:55:02 Okay, um You need the full eight He's like He's like playstation rest mode. He's ready to go. He notices stuff. But as long as he doesn't move he maintains his sleep
Kaladen Shash 01:55:06 Leopold, how long do you, are you required to rest? Do you need a full eight? Are you like six, are you four? Okay. Okay, so yes, you're always, yeah, he can, yeah. Okay. Cool, cool, cool.
Leopold Magnus 01:55:13 I think I need a full but I have the centuries rest. Which basically means I can't be like a startled. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:55:31 That's pretty cool.
Dungeon Master 01:55:33 Both of the automatons can do that. Okay, first watch. Kaladin, go ahead and roll me a d20. You want above a 10. 10 or lower is bad.
Cletus Cobbington 01:55:44 Well, I hit the A.
Kaladen Shash 01:56:03 All right, who comes? Okay, okay.
Dungeon Master 01:56:14 Roll me a D3, so a D4 minus one. OK.
Cyrus Schwert 01:56:31 I didn't like that okay. That okay sounded like I don't want this.
Kaladen Shash 01:56:35 One, got a one.
Dungeon Master 01:56:48 Okay. Next watch would be Leopold. Leopold, give me a d20 roll you want above a 10. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:56:58 OK. Got it. I also did note it's six hours inactive, so it doesn't need to be a full eight. There you go, 19. Yeah, no worries.
Kaladen Shash 01:57:10 Yeah, there you go. All right, cool. Level out, no worries. Yeah, we're good. They level out, that's all I'm saying. He got above, I got below. He got a 19, I got a two.
Cyrus Schwert 01:57:14 It's been balanced.
Cletus Cobbington 01:57:20 All right.
Dungeon Master 01:57:26 You guys haven't beat the boss yet, you don't get to level up. Something happens with Zariel while he's sleeping, but I'm gonna send it to Jesse separately and I'll let him
Leopold Magnus 01:57:39 That's 21 if you add them together.
Cyrus Schwert 01:57:42 Bye, Jack. God be good for us.
Dungeon Master 01:57:54 Tell the group if he wants to when he's back. So something happens Dream sequence wise, you know personal stuff that I didn't want him to mess out So you guys awake haven't gotten a long rest? Wounds are healed stiffness is out Um It's really inflamed and puffy it's so rained
Kaladen Shash 01:57:58 Okay. Oh, cool. Fucking massive.
Cletus Cobbington 01:58:14 I have a huge skeeter bite on the back of my neck. I'm so refreshed though. No, do not touch. That's my suck hole, okay? Don't touch.
Cyrus Schwert 01:58:21 There's so much pus in it, if you pop it, you drown.
Leopold Magnus 01:58:27 Oh, Kalidus, do you want me to maybe pop that? It's not looking so good. OK, well, let's do it yourself.
Kaladen Shash 01:58:35 Oh, fuck off.
Cletus Cobbington 01:58:47 Chip get on it. He's got delicate sweet hands. Disgusting. I put him back in my pocket. That was gross.
Cyrus Schwert 01:58:48 It looks like that spot right above your suckle is, like, really sensitive. It might feel good if you touch that. Just... just guess. Oh, you're gross.
Dungeon Master 01:59:01 You see, Chip almost has like a chipmunk mouth and he's like just sucking the whole thing. And then chilled glass.
Cletus Cobbington 01:59:18 as I chug warm sake on milk. Look. All right. All right. Let's look at this door, I think.
Cyrus Schwert 01:59:23 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:59:24 Uh.
Dungeon Master 01:59:34 a door. It's got just like a lined around it, you have most of the orb spots sort of circular around in the center is the spot for the 10th one, all of them are empty.
Kaladen Shash 01:59:53 I've got some of them, I pull out what I've got, whatever, plug them in. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:59:58 You plug them in, each one you see like some runes arcane sort of spark out and connect between each one that you plant in one at a time. Do you guys do all 10?
Cletus Cobbington 02:00:09 Is there.
Cyrus Schwert 02:00:12 Yes.
Dungeon Master 02:00:12 Okay, you see, as each individual line set connects with the other, the door starts rotating, and the orbs start rotating themselves in different directions. And you hear like little mechanisms clicking and setting into place. And the door with a thud sort of sets down and the dust shifts off of it. And as the door sort of presses open, you see there is this long descending staircase into the dark.
Kaladen Shash 02:00:42 What do I see? Is it more than 90 feet long? Okay, I go down the staircase. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:00:46 uh a long staircase descending into the dark yeah you see it goes like about 90 feet and then like like 10 more feet down it seems to hit the bottom or something
Cyrus Schwert 02:00:50 Oh, yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:00:50 I throw a nut, see how long it takes to get down. All right.
Kaladen Shash 02:01:10 They step forward into the tunnel.
Dungeon Master 02:01:15 As you step farther and farther down, you're going, you see, again, you had seen like this, this is a room that hasn't been disturbed in a long time, and you had caught glimpses of this in the previous ruins. You see little like artworks and drawing and murals of these creatures, of like all these animal folk that you found.
Dungeon Master 02:01:36 is almost like a lost culture in itself. In the dome, so much time has passed that there was almost like a rise, a peak, and a fall of this animal civilization. You see animals on all fours. They haven't gone bipedal. You see little murals and diagrams that show a house sitting on these chicken legs.
Dungeon Master 02:01:59 crudely depicted in this tall forest and then after that you see all of the animals are like bipedal and a little more humanoid. And as you're going down you finally hit the bottom of the staircase and there's this doorway that is not open but it's just a simple latch sort of turned down. On it depicted is
Dungeon Master 02:02:19 three circles and they sort of connect in the center of each one, like a Venn diagram, and it is a snake head, a lion head, and a dragon. Sorry, it is a snake, a serpent, a lion, and a ram.
Leopold Magnus 02:02:41 Jonathan, can you explain the house with chicken legs? Maybe I misunderstood that. OK. Oh. Natural one.
Dungeon Master 02:02:49 Give me a history check. It just doesn't ring a bell at all. It's almost too obscure to sort of meet any reference that you could just pick up with that.
Cletus Cobbington 02:02:55 We all know houses used to be made out of chickens.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:59 Gosh.
Leopold Magnus 02:03:10 Okay, but I guess visually what I'm seeing is a house and it has lights.
Dungeon Master 02:03:14 You are seeing this old, like cabin, almost like a cabin in the woods types of single level, shaded windows kind of broken down roof doesn't look well surface and the way it's painted again, very crude, but does very distinct, like avian chicken legs that are enormous, coming directly out of the bottom of the house, holding the house a loft some sort of distance off the ground.
Leopold Magnus 02:03:39 Okay. And then, so preceding that, the animals are walking on all fours, and then after, they're bipedal. Okay. Interesting.
Dungeon Master 02:03:47 Mm-hmm. Yes.
Cletus Cobbington 02:03:55 Hmm. All right. Is there anything going on with the door? I know there was the three circles with the creatures. There's nothing else. Can I poke the ramp?
Kaladen Shash 02:04:06 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:04:16 There's just the depiction of the three creatures in the circles, but it is just a closed door. You poke it, you notice it, it's not magical or anything, it's just like etched into the door, so you touch it, nothing seems to happen. It seems like you could open it if you wanted to.
Cletus Cobbington 02:04:31 Oh, okay. Gotcha. And the doors latch down as in, like, you can open it. Or... Okay. Should we... All right. Creak it open.
Kaladen Shash 02:04:47 I think we should, I think we should open it, that's why we're here.
Dungeon Master 02:04:57 Can I give me a second to get everything I got to go back and forth on different maps, but I'll describe what you guys see it. So you open it and there is this
Dungeon Master 02:05:11 fairly large circular platform that drops off into darkness surrounding the whole thing. There are depictions of knights in crude armor. You can see some of the armor helmets seems to be like pronounced in like a snout fashion making you think that these are like statues of animalistic knights from at some point in time.
Dungeon Master 02:05:34 The big piece of the room, though, that you see is in the very center of the room. There is this depiction of this creature. It is fully made of stone, like 10 feet by five feet or so, pretty large overall. And it is a creature that has wings sprouting off its back, three heads. One of them is a lion's head. One of them is a ram's head. One of them is a serpent head of some kind.
Dungeon Master 02:06:04 And that is all you really see in this room.
Cletus Cobbington 02:06:08 That fucker's scary.
Kaladen Shash 02:06:10 Excellent.
Cyrus Schwert 02:06:38 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:06:41 Did you take a long rest, Cyrus? Did you input that? Okay. And the creature's there or it's like a statue? All right, made a stone.
Dungeon Master 02:06:58 It is a statue. Go for it. And then we can make any checks you want, and you can do any sort of assisting you want. I will say Zoriel as a base will give you assistance, and you can get a plus, too. So 18.
Leopold Magnus 02:07:04 Can I do a history investigation on or get a history check or an investigation on the statues? See if I recognize that. So maybe a history. Okay, so I guess I would make it 18, yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:07:28 This is a depiction of a creature known as a chimera. But as far as you can tell, without like just going up and like just grabbing it and looking at it, investigating, so looking at it from afar, it just seems to be a statue. No.
Leopold Magnus 02:07:42 OK. Yeah, and I don't recognize the, I mean, I know it's a chimera, but there's nothing that stands out like as, oh, that one is a famous or something like that. Got it.
Cletus Cobbington 02:07:58 Can I do an animal handling check on it? No.
Kaladen Shash 02:08:06 Do we see any other inscriptions in the room? Do we see any other indication as to what this space is for? Yeah, I'll quietly like scoot around towards like one of the walls and see if there's like any inscriptions or something.
Dungeon Master 02:08:07 Do you look around the room? Do you move around in it? Move yourself to where you want to be.
Kaladen Shash 02:08:39 Move over here a little bit. OK. OK.
Dungeon Master 02:08:45 Nothing happens, crazy, but as you move that way, once you sort of get a sightline past the statue, you see there is like this book sitting on a pedestal in the very back of the room, like back here.
Kaladen Shash 02:09:08 ... I would have, I would have engaged ... the mask for the day, so everyone can communicate. I can see book. Yeah. I can see book in the back, but I don't know if this statue is not more than it seems.
Dungeon Master 02:09:16 you all have your telepathic connection.
Cletus Cobbington 02:09:30 Well, might need to take a little look-see in the book. Anybody good at reading? Why don't you take a...
Kaladen Shash 02:09:45 Can I try to sneak past it and get the book?
Cyrus Schwert 02:09:45 You are an enigma. You don't have eyes. How do you stand? I don't get it. That's the part I don't get.
Leopold Magnus 02:09:50 Well, I'm pretty pretty good. Leopold's just staring at his hands aimlessly.
Cletus Cobbington 02:10:05 Silence.
Dungeon Master 02:10:07 As they bicker, Callan, you try to sneak past it. There's no need to sneak. You see it. It seems completely innate. Even as you're creeping up, nothing is happening. There's no movement. There seems to be a little placard at the base of where the statue is built on, the little foundation.
Kaladen Shash 02:10:28 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:10:29 And as you get pretty close before you pass it, you notice there is a glint of almost like this incredibly polished and futuristically sleek is the best way to describe it. Almost looks like a collar around the central head, or the lion head. But it almost looks too small. So if the stone is supposed to be completely flush, this little collar thing is set into it a little bit.
Kaladen Shash 02:11:03 OK. Does the book, is it anything of note? Does it have a title? Is it just a journal?
Dungeon Master 02:11:15 You read it, it's more of a journal format, it doesn't have like a fancy title printed on the front, but it catalogs from some long lost scientific weasel, we'll say.
Dungeon Master 02:11:33 about how in the history of these creatures when they were living in these ruins, there landed this alien threat. These cephalopodic creatures with tentacles on their face sort of took hive in one of the buildings and it turned into this long drawn-out war that proved pretty fruitless as these mind flares reproduced quicker than they can be extinguished because of some unknown cause.
Dungeon Master 02:12:00 And after this dragged out for a while, eventually there is this comet that fell from the sky and they took the metal that was from the meteorite at the center of it and they fashioned this circlet that seemed to have some sort of psionic shielding effect, which was the Mind Flayer's main method of fighting. And they had
Dungeon Master 02:12:24 this incredible weapon that helped them for a while before it seemed as though it still just wasn't quite enough. They weren't strong enough. And so they entrusted this circlet to this creature that they created slash enchanted called the Protector.
Dungeon Master 02:12:42 And so you're reading this journal, skimming through it. It's got crude drawings of this thing as they sculpted it. And then they put a lot of enchantment to it. And then they placed this circlet around the center head so that it couldn't be tampered with. They couldn't be taken by the enemy kind of deal. And then it sort of cuts off, like the person stopped updating it. They either died of old age or were killed off. You don't know for certain. That's what you get from that.
Kaladen Shash 02:13:11 I think this is the circlet that we saw the first time we were swimming. And I think we need to somehow take it off the statue.
Cletus Cobbington 02:13:27 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 02:13:31 Well, that sounds like a good intuition, Kaladin, but I feel like if we disturb this statue, it could be bad news. Well, indeed. I just suppose we should be prepared. Ooh, that would be an interesting thought.
Cyrus Schwert 02:13:32 We lost the strategy.
Kaladen Shash 02:13:39 it is, but then how do we defeat Mind Flayers? Do you think we can turn the Protector back on and make it do its job? Possibility? Don't know how to wake up Stone, I'm just saying, talking out loud.
Leopold Magnus 02:14:08 I'm going to walk up and just give it a knock. I'm going to give a knock on the stone statue. Yep, see what happens. Well, I think this fellow is pretty well in a sleep. Maybe we should just take his little hat and go.
Cyrus Schwert 02:14:08 I don't know how to wake up.
Cletus Cobbington 02:14:09 Ha ha.
Dungeon Master 02:14:15 just on the stone itself. Dull thud, just knocking on solid rock. It almost looks like it's
Kaladen Shash 02:14:33 Does the circlip look like it has any latch or like pin and lock? It looks seamless.
Dungeon Master 02:14:45 sealed slash melted into the stone itself, like it's very much attached into it. It's a very beautifully polished, like shiny gray type metal again, very meteoric, futuristic looking with one very clear opalescent gem set into like the center of it.
Kaladen Shash 02:15:07 Did the journal explain how they put it on, the creature, other than that it was made and they gave it to it? Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll, I'll poke Jim. Let me, let me reach out.
Cletus Cobbington 02:15:08 Poke the gym. Poke it. Boop. He boops the gym.
Dungeon Master 02:15:12 It didn't. Again, it was mostly crude. It just described that they created this creature to protect this artifact.
Cyrus Schwert 02:15:27 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:15:35 Does anything happen? Is it special? It needs light now? Perfect, here we go. We will now earn the circlet. Prepare yourselves.
Dungeon Master 02:15:40 Just important for context, as he touches it, it'll be on this side of it. Where is everybody else in the room? Position yourselves where you would be.
Cletus Cobbington 02:15:58 I don't know, we were talking to him, so probably, I don't know, closer, but not necessarily as far as he went. I guess I'll be a little closer, because I was really rallying him up to poke the gym.
Cyrus Schwert 02:16:10 I'm not in the mix. I am frightened. I'm not enjoying this. 40.
Dungeon Master 02:16:24 OK, Cyrus is approximately 40 feet from the statue. Cleetus is about 20. Zariel, where do you want Zariel to be? Also, he's just sort of standing next to Cyrus.
Kaladen Shash 02:16:39 He could have been lagging wherever he's at right now. OK.
Dungeon Master 02:16:54 Okay, you touch the gem. As you touch the gem itself, you hear this little ringing as almost like you hit a bell and then the faint distance, you kind of hear it resonating just like that constantly building sound. Then slowly you see like a piece of the shoulder sort of cracks, and then part of it falls off.
Cletus Cobbington 02:17:14 Hello, folks.
Kaladen Shash 02:17:14 Yep.
Dungeon Master 02:17:16 And then another piece cracks and falls off. And then a piece sort of on the center chest, a larger piece falls off. And you see once that piece falls off, there's like this almost explosion of purple light. And as piece by piece falls off, you see very well underneath is this smaller than the statue, but still stone formed. It's like this animated statue that has this purple energy. There's a fly there.
Dungeon Master 02:17:45 Got it. Purple energy sort of running through veins in its body. The circlet isn't as tight on this form. It sort of hangs perfectly around its neck as this chimera sort of steps forward and then sits onto its haunches. And it opens its mouth, but you hear almost projected into your head this voice that just rings out and goes, be you friend or foe.
Kaladen Shash 02:18:17 I think we're on the same team. We are friends. We're trying to kill off the mind flayers. We seek your help.
Cyrus Schwert 02:18:18 I love you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:18:18 Brain.
Dungeon Master 02:18:27 a low grumble somehow resonates into your head as you see its eyes as its head turns the main it is just I should clarify it is one single head it doesn't have three heads itself it's just a lion head but as it turns the form changes the stone morphs and you see that as it turns one way the ram head is the one that is looking over and it kind of makes eye contact with Leopold and then Cletus and then it turns its head and it looks past
Dungeon Master 02:18:56 Kaladin towards Cyrus and Zariel and the serpent head sort of extends up a little bit as it like looks down past and then it sets back down into its haunches looking directly at you. The lion head returns and it goes, and how much I know the truth.
Cletus Cobbington 02:19:13 Well.
Kaladen Shash 02:19:19 How could we demonstrate this to you? We've managed to collect all the orbs and we killed the insects that were infesting the area.
Cyrus Schwert 02:19:19 Um.
Dungeon Master 02:19:38 See, like the answer it's looking for, because again, it is still animated. It's not sentient. It's got basic response built-in kind of deal. A lot of what you said doesn't get addressed because it doesn't register, and it sort of takes a moment to process, and it goes, be you friend or foe strong enough to take it from me, and the challenge will initiate.
Dungeon Master 02:20:04 If you were unworthy or of the wrong kind, you will be defeated. You see it looks down, and if a lion could smirk, it does. And it goes, powerless folk.
Kaladen Shash 02:20:11 We are your friends, but we do need your color. We will prove ourselves worthy. Prepare yourself.
Cyrus Schwert 02:20:19 Please.
Dungeon Master 02:20:29 I accept your challenge. And then at the perimeter of the entire room, one after just like, you see this purple arcane wall shoots up over 100 feet up into the ceiling where you can't see this is an enormous chamber, completely isolating this ring that you are on making it so that you can't leave this constantly oscillating purple force. And it snarls and unless you take an attack of opportunity instantly, it's sort of
Dungeon Master 02:20:57 jumps back like five feet diagonal, five feet back, five feet up. It's a wing stone wings flare out and this thing is way too heavy to fly. Realistically, it's very magically held aloft as like the purple energy flows out and you hear its joints creak. It is for sure made of stone. This is a construct of some kind. It is not a live creature. It is 1013. You guys want to start combat, finish stuff real quick.
Cletus Cobbington 02:21:11 Silence.
Kaladen Shash 02:21:30 Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm down starting getting through this. Got it, we got it, turn up for the fences, I hear you.
Cyrus Schwert 02:21:31 Yes.
Leopold Magnus 02:21:32 Yeah, I mean how long are you thinking? Is it? Is there going to be like a big fight or? Hi.
Dungeon Master 02:21:36 It doesn't have a ton of hit points, and there's a lot of you now. We can see how it goes. We'll stop it partway through if it's not making good progress. OK, let's do it. Everybody roll initiative.
Kaladen Shash 02:22:05 As as I was answering it sort of in a challenging voice, would I have had a chance to take an action before initiative started? I just wanted to cast mirror image. OK.
Cletus Cobbington 02:22:06 All right.
Dungeon Master 02:22:15 Depending on your action, yes. Go for it. Everybody can sort of have a similar minor action if they want. You see Zariel will start out by doing his tried and true method. He will do, does he have it prepared?
Dungeon Master 02:22:43 I don't see it. I think he got rid of it because it wasn't working. He will do his bear transformation. OK, what is anybody else doing?
Kaladen Shash 02:22:43 Wild sheep, he's got to have, got to have wild sheep.
Cyrus Schwert 02:22:51 Sorry.
Leopold Magnus 02:23:14 I'm gonna cast a Magic Stone as my minor action. Did the Still Defender go away, or is he still just tracking around? Yeah, it's a 24 hour deal.
Dungeon Master 02:23:18 You've got magic stone up. I mean, it lasts all day, doesn't it? Then he's he's with you. I just have to bring him over. OK. Get a true strike in. What is true strike do?
Cyrus Schwert 02:23:39 I cast True Strike on him if I can.
Kaladen Shash 02:23:49 Get some ready for his punch.
Dungeon Master 02:23:53 Okay. Okay. At the very top, Cletus.
Cletus Cobbington 02:24:15 oh shit um you know what i'm 20 feet away right okay um i'm gonna wild shape and turn into a wild boar um
Dungeon Master 02:24:24 Mm-hmm. Wild boar.
Kaladen Shash 02:24:41 Silence. Silence.
Cletus Cobbington 02:24:45 And that's an action, so I can't necessarily do too much there. Can I cast any bonus action? Turn to a boar. And then, yeah, we'll wait.
Cletus Cobbington 02:25:15 Then I'll bonus action Hidden Step. That makes me turn invisible until the start of my next turn. I attack or deal damage. Alright, that's me.
Kaladen Shash 02:25:26 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:25:26 OK, you are invisible for now. The. You guys don't know it, but it is called the Astral Stone Chimera. Will. He's got he'll start things off pretty hot. You see where he's at. He can do a.
Cyrus Schwert 02:25:41 Perfect.
Dungeon Master 02:25:56 15 foot cone. What does that get me? Pigos.
Kaladen Shash 02:26:03 each couple of people.
Dungeon Master 02:26:25 Okay, he can get the three of you just barely be angles himself, right? He will do... I need... each of you to give me a dexterity saving throw.
Cletus Cobbington 02:26:29 Jesus.
Kaladen Shash 02:26:39 There we go. 3020.
Dungeon Master 02:26:54 20 saves. Leopold gets 8, 8 fail. Field defender gets.
Leopold Magnus 02:27:00 8? Yeah. Oh, it's very dexterous. Oh, it has a plus 1. So what would it saving through? Oh, OK, a plus 1. Dex plus 1 plus proficiency bonus. So plus 4?
Kaladen Shash 02:27:27 It's terrible.
Dungeon Master 02:27:32 Plus 4. Plus 1 for deck. Still fails. Okay, so Leopold and the Steel Defender both take 39 points of psychic damage. Kaladin, you take half of that. So you will take 19.
Leopold Magnus 02:27:32 Because my proficiency bonus is 3, and then it's my... your dex. Yeah, so d20 plus 4. Better than Iapol's, but yeah, 12.
Cletus Cobbington 02:27:57 Jesus.
Kaladen Shash 02:27:57 Yeah. Yep.
Cyrus Schwert 02:27:57 Shit.
Leopold Magnus 02:28:03 39 points. Jesus.
Dungeon Master 02:28:08 But that is... When its breath weapon is available, it can use it in place of... Okay, so it also will then swoop in to the person who took less damage, and it'll take... That's not it. That... In place of one of it. Okay, so then it'll go ahead and bite you. Does a 23 hit.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:38 Yeah, even if I shield, that's, uh, it's. Okay. It's like right up in my face, isn't it?
Leopold Magnus 02:28:42 No, still the fender goes down.
Dungeon Master 02:28:45 Okay, still Defender is down. You take 15 points of piercing damage, Kaladin. Okay, after that is Kaladin. Here we go. Yep, it flew back into combat with you. It landed on the ground. It's no longer flying.
Kaladen Shash 02:29:09 It's in the. It's in the air. OK, OK, it's on the ground, OK? Uh. I think it's a greater primarily one option. I'll go ahead and just cast.
Kaladen Shash 02:29:39 Uh. That's probably pretty dexterous. That's alright, I'll just. I'll just do a. A melee attack with light splitter. 11 is not going to hit alley.
Cletus Cobbington 02:29:47 That broke up a bunch bird.
Dungeon Master 02:30:08 11 does not hit. Okay. Leopold, it is your turn then. Oh, movement. Okay, you skirt to the other side. Leopold, your go.
Kaladen Shash 02:30:11 Yeah, I don't want to provoke an attack on it. I'm already getting pretty hit. I'll use my movement to skirt around without losing its melee range.
Leopold Magnus 02:30:38 I'll come in now that I have flanking with Kaladin, and I'll take 2 attacks with my Searing Saber. I guess I'll have advantage on that. 25 to hit. 13 damage plus 5 fire damage, so 18 on that squink.
Kaladen Shash 02:30:53 There you go. Yep.
Dungeon Master 02:30:56 25 hits. Nice. 18 damage. Natural 20. Nice. Everything is doubled. Yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:31:07 And then, oh, a natural 20. Hell yeah. So then this would double, we just double up the roll. So that would include the fire. Okay. D8. Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:31:24 So, you know, 2D8 plus 2D6 plus 12. Yeah. 7 more. We're at 24.
Leopold Magnus 02:31:36 2d8 plus 6, and then 2d6 plus 6, right? Yeah, got it. OK, so here's the 1, 2. So you have 7 more damage. Yep, on that one strike, yeah. So that was my action. Then
Kaladen Shash 02:31:52 24, 30.
Dungeon Master 02:31:57 30 damage, nicely done. Oh, you have an advantage if you didn't already roll with the barrage. You did, okay, perfect.
Cletus Cobbington 02:32:06 What?
Leopold Magnus 02:32:08 Yeah, I did, yeah. And then for my bonus action. Yeah, I guess I'll just do it. I'll just, I'll launch a stone. And then I guess I'm within melee range, so it'll be with disadvantage or, okay. Slap roll, got it, okay. 27, I'm assuming hits.
Dungeon Master 02:32:26 Disadvantage plus advantage just cancels out. It's a straight roll. 27 hits. Nice. We're already showing a lot of wear and tear.
Leopold Magnus 02:32:39 6 damage on that stone. Yep, and that is my round.
Kaladen Shash 02:32:44 Well. Good round.
Dungeon Master 02:32:55 After your turn, it is going to use a legendary action. Oh, well... That, um... Actually, okay, so for your stone... It is not AoE, right? It's just an attack roll against it. Oh, and it's an attack... Okay, never mind. It doesn't come up. It has something against spells that make it do seeming throws.
Leopold Magnus 02:33:13 Yeah. OK.
Cletus Cobbington 02:33:19 you
Dungeon Master 02:33:25 It will spend one legendary action and you see it teleports directly behind... It'll do all the way to the back of the room. Cyrus and the bear. After that, Steel Defender gets to go. Oh, Steel Defender's gone. Cyrus gets to go.
Cyrus Schwert 02:33:46 Okay. So I'm 40 feet away. How far am I away again? Perfect.
Leopold Magnus 02:33:47 dead.
Dungeon Master 02:34:00 Oh, it can only go 30 feet. It'll go right there. You are now in combat with it. You do get advantage. Letus is flanking.
Cyrus Schwert 02:34:17 I will take a couple swings at it and get jiggy with it. Let's go. OK. I will swing it. How do you do with advantage on here? Here we go.
Cletus Cobbington 02:34:23 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:34:49 Yeah, there you go. 17 hit.
Dungeon Master 02:34:54 There. Yeah. Uh, both of those head. Yes, 17 minutes.
Cyrus Schwert 02:34:57 And I'll just do both. Oops, forgot that. Great. Perfect.
Kaladen Shash 02:35:21 We are.
Cyrus Schwert 02:35:28 We got 13, plus 14, plus 5. So 32. I'll do a defensive flourish with one of those. Is that OK? OK.
Dungeon Master 02:35:51 Yeah. So whatever one was the D8 that you wanted it to be, it was the one that you rolled already. So you had, oh, roll an extra D8. Yeah, yeah. You get to decide. Nice. You add eight gear armor.
Cyrus Schwert 02:35:58 Rolled the 8. Yes. Another 8. And my AC goes up to 24. All in my turn.
Cletus Cobbington 02:36:18 Damn.
Kaladen Shash 02:36:20 Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:36:20 And it takes 8 additional damage. Okay, big hit. That was nasty. It'll use a legendary action at the end of your turn and just make an attack against you. 10 misses.
Dungeon Master 02:36:49 Up at the top is going to be bare form of Zerial. He'll take his attack. He's got way too much shit. Oh shit, he crits on the first attack. Second attack.
Kaladen Shash 02:37:10 you
Cyrus Schwert 02:37:18 you
Dungeon Master 02:37:23 also hits both hits so the bear does normally it's a d8 plus 5 so it's 2d8 plus 10 plus a d8 plus 5 so 3d8 plus 15 soft roll 24 it's looking hurt
Cletus Cobbington 02:37:27 Big bear. Nice.
Kaladen Shash 02:37:48 That's still good. That's still good.
Dungeon Master 02:37:57 Cletus, you are invisible, but it is your turn as a boar. It is within range of you. It's five feet. It takes enough space that it's just still in melee with you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:38:02 How far am I? Am I like 10 feet? Okay. Okay. Also, quick question. I was looking it up for a spell that I have. It says that it relies on
Kaladen Shash 02:38:29 Bye.
Cletus Cobbington 02:38:30 My spellcasting ability modifier. And it said for druids, is that like my wisdom score or modifier? Ah, yes. Okay. So it is. Okay. Yep. Now I see it. Okay. Good to know. Okay. Oh, really? Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:38:32 I'll be back soon.
Dungeon Master 02:38:34 Your spell modifier is listed on your page above your spells. But you also can't cast a spell if you are pile shaped. You can cast a spell.
Cletus Cobbington 02:39:01 That's fine. OK. Gotcha. I see. OK, well, first for everything. OK, so I'm going to do a slightly weird maneuver. I'm going to back up to where I'm 20 feet away. And that was.
Dungeon Master 02:39:03 before you wild shape, and druids can maintain concentration while transformed, but you can't do it the other way around. Let's do it. Okay. As soon as you back up, it's going to take an attack of opportunity. Is that okay?
Cletus Cobbington 02:39:33 That would make me... I guess. That's a chance to miss. Go for it. Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:39:39 You got, you got, you got, you got blood to give. Probably. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:39:44 Does have a chance to miss. 7 for a total of 14. That's 14 hits. The boar's armor class. Okay, no big deal. These are not juicy hits. The big thing is its breath weapon. 7 damage.
Cletus Cobbington 02:40:04 Oh, thank god. Okay. Ooh. Actually, that affects one of my traits, Relentless. If the board takes 7 damage or less, that would reduce it to zero. Oh, never mind. Never mind. Doesn't matter. Okay, so 20 feet away. Now I'm gonna fuckin' use my charge attack.
Dungeon Master 02:40:20 OK, it doesn't reduce it to 0. Are you going to do a charging attack nice? It's yeah, slash R space and then.
Cletus Cobbington 02:40:30 Yep. So that makes me able to do 4D6 instead of 1D6. And then rolling the custom, do I have to do the slash R or do I just type in like 4D6?
Dungeon Master 02:40:47 1D something plus blank and you can do it for crazy numbers, so it's pretty cool and you can combine it so you can say slash R1D8 plus 1D6 plus something and it rolls it all at once. Yes. You would get advantage because you're going to be blanking by the time you get there.
Cletus Cobbington 02:40:58 Oh, wait, I probably had to roll to hit though, don't I? Probably have to do that first. Okay, that's the attack roll if it hits. Okay, what is this? Okay, so this has plus four for my hit. Okay, that's 15.
Kaladen Shash 02:41:04 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:41:07 Excellent.
Dungeon Master 02:41:21 Yeah, the board doesn't have a crazy hit. 11, that's one of them. Go ahead and roll again for advantage. 15 does miss though. Okay, so go ahead and re-roll it because I want to see if you could do way better. Roll 8d6 plus 2.
Cletus Cobbington 02:41:34 Nat 20. What the fuck was that? R.
Kaladen Shash 02:41:36 Oh, good sound.
Cyrus Schwert 02:41:52 So we roll double dice? Are you an idiot?
Dungeon Master 02:41:55 Yeah, everything's doubled. I like it to be juicy. Oh, you did R slash instead of slash R. Simple mistake. It always happens. That's what I say every time I would fuck it up when I was doing like 20d8. I'd be like, Jarlene, fuck that up. Holy shit. 17 damage. Heart not dead.
Cletus Cobbington 02:42:03 Oh, gotcha. Oh, it's only one. So that puts me right up on another.
Kaladen Shash 02:42:18 No, man.
Cyrus Schwert 02:42:24 Thanks.
Cletus Cobbington 02:42:34 All right, that's me. Yep.
Dungeon Master 02:42:35 Okay. Good. Fun stuff. It'll use a legendary action to teleport 30 feet into the air. So it is still in the same spot, but it's just directly up. And you see, like, it warps space and, like, gravity. You hear this, like, this purple orb sort of surrounds it, and it disappears and instantaneously is above you. And then to start its turn, it's going to roll to see if it gets its breath weapon.
Kaladen Shash 02:43:05 Does it.
Dungeon Master 02:43:06 five or six does not it will um i'm just gonna roll i'm just gonna roll for it three one two three cyrus it'll
Dungeon Master 02:43:28 It's already looking very... you see the stone is cracking. A lot of light is sort of showing through. It is looking very hurt. So it comes pummeling at the air. It's not going to give you guys advantage this time. It learned that time. So it'll come down on the other side of you and it'll take its three attacks on you. First one is going to be the claws. That is 21. You have your bumped AC right now, correct?
Cyrus Schwert 02:43:54 It is not it. It's.
Dungeon Master 02:43:56 It'll try to bite you. 20 doesn't hit. It'll do its tail attack. You're a bad one to roll. 26 to hit. And then you take eight points of damage. And then it's not looking good, so it's got...
Cletus Cobbington 02:44:08 Fuck.
Kaladen Shash 02:44:10 Silence.
Cyrus Schwert 02:44:23 Yeah, I would like. Come.
Dungeon Master 02:44:25 60 fly speed. So it used 30 to get down to you. It's going to use 30 feet to go straight up. You can take an attack opportunity if you'd like. Okay, go and attack it as it leaves your space.
Cletus Cobbington 02:44:43 He likes that.
Cyrus Schwert 02:44:54 27. Isn't it rolling? It hates rolling, of course, damage. So bad at me. 14.
Dungeon Master 02:44:56 27 hats. It's a good question. Why isn't it doing?
Kaladen Shash 02:44:58 Hold up.
Cyrus Schwert 02:45:24 As it flies away.
Dungeon Master 02:45:25 14, examine. Okay. After it ends its turn, Kaladin is your turn. It is 40 feet out, 30 feet up. That's a 3, 4, 5 triangle. It's 50 feet away from you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:45:32 Banana, banana.
Kaladen Shash 02:45:40 It's in the air, correct? Good. All right, I'm going to, I'm going to shoot. Just saw a blast, that was quick math. I can't see it. 26. 19 hits.
Dungeon Master 02:45:54 3-4-5 is an easy ratio. Pythagoras would be proud of me. 26 hits. 19 hits. Chawan misses. Almost got me.
Kaladen Shash 02:46:12 Natural one hits. OK. 14 force.
Cyrus Schwert 02:46:17 You almost got him, dude. You almost got him. He almost said it.
Dungeon Master 02:46:26 OK, go and roll your 2D10. If there wasn't the delay of the online, it might have been more immediate. So close. Not dead. I will change it so that you guys can see where it is at.
Kaladen Shash 02:46:43 Um, I'm too far away. Yeah, that's, that's all I can really do. We'll pull finish him.
Dungeon Master 02:47:10 At the end of your turn, it will burn. It's got them back on its turn.
Cletus Cobbington 02:47:30 Right.
Dungeon Master 02:47:30 Okay, it'll use two legendary actions and it is going to pull... What is the range on this? Any creature it can see within 60 feet. Everybody's within 60 feet. It will pull the boar into the air. It only pulls 30 feet.
Kaladen Shash 02:47:43 So everybody.
Dungeon Master 02:47:57 which is not enough to get you in range, but you see the Chimera uses like this gravitational pull and the boar gets yanked 30 feet in the air before falling 30 feet. You take 2d6 bludgeoning damage as you fall. Give me a dexterity saving throw to see if you fall prone. And you take 5 points of damage.
Kaladen Shash 02:48:22 All right.
Cletus Cobbington 02:48:22 3020.
Dungeon Master 02:48:25 3 to 20, you're fine. You land on your feet, your little hoofs sort of scratched on the ground as you sort of gather it, but you maintain it. Leopold, your turn.
Leopold Magnus 02:48:36 Okay, it's time to finish this beast. I'm gonna sprint across. Yep, 30 feet. Take up the flanking position, or is it still flying? Oh, 30 feet in the air. Oh man, okay. Then I won't run, but I will do a catapult.
Dungeon Master 02:48:52 It is in the air, so it's 30 feet in the air. What are you catapulting? Sure, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:48:53 Bye. Bye.
Leopold Magnus 02:49:10 So I am going to pick up one of these loose floor tiles. Looks like they could be pulled up pretty easily. It's kind of an old cracked up floor. I'm going to drop that inside my chest cavity. I'm not going to angle myself quite 90 degrees, maybe have a 30 degree bend to target the chimera floating in the air. I'm going to let it fly. So you should hear this.
Leopold Magnus 02:49:39 16. Yeah. Well, maybe I fucked that up. Let's see.
Dungeon Master 02:49:40 The dexterity save, correct. Believe it or not, it is not dexterous. It gets a plus one, so it'll be... It has one HP, so if it fails this throw, it's dead. That is an 11.
Kaladen Shash 02:49:53 That's a big creature. What's the number? That's a fail. Yas. Yas.
Cyrus Schwert 02:49:58 Yes.
Leopold Magnus 02:50:09 Bails. Yeah, so Leopold's head just kind of snaps back, leaving his chest cavity of the cannon barrel exposed. You see this jagged floor tile fly through the air. And just barely clipped the feathering of one of its wings here, and it sends it into a death spiral, and it falls just perfectly on its little ram head neck.
Dungeon Master 02:50:09 Leopold, how do you want to finish this creature?
Leopold Magnus 02:50:38 And it falls over dead.
Dungeon Master 02:50:41 Yeah, it is this stone construct that is like defying gravity somehow about being there, but it's wings still made of stone and energy still flap this catapulted spinning stone floor tile, severs it at the wing at the base and you see it goes into a spiral. It hits the ground and it was so broken and cracked to begin with that as that transition to like the ram head, the head is cracked and broken off and this creature lays innate in the center of the room, having its neck
Dungeon Master 02:51:11 sort of snap, you see the circlet rolls and sort of circles before laying flat on the ground. For anybody to grab. Do you grab it?
Leopold Magnus 02:51:22 And Leopold's head's still looking at the skies, yelling, did I get it? Did I get it?
Kaladen Shash 02:51:29 I'll step forward and pick it up, pick up this. Is it pretty big still? Does it resize? Is this huge thing? Yeah, I'll pick it up.
Dungeon Master 02:51:42 Let me just change. Yeah, that's fine. You pick it up, and it is cool to the touch. It seems to resonate in your hand a little bit, just constantly as if a bell was rung with it. And you see, the longer you hold it, it sort of shrinks down, looking almost as if it could fit your head if you put it on.
Kaladen Shash 02:52:04 Could I can I cast identify to better understand what it does or is? I mean, we have an idea because we saw the. Inscriptions that we need to get this, but. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:52:16 Yeah, are you going to do the full casting for Identify? OK, hold on. Go ahead and type in to your inventory psionic aegis. So P-S-I-O-N-I-C-A-E-G-I-S. See it?
Kaladen Shash 02:52:48 Go ahead and restart for me again. You already put it in my inventory or am I looking for it in every individual? Okay, there we go. Sorry.
Dungeon Master 02:52:51 Yeah, P-S-I-O-N-I-C, psionic, and then aegis is A-E-G-I-S. I did not. To add it, yeah. If you're managing your inventory, you should find it. I can't add it in. And that's what it does once you get that.
Cletus Cobbington 02:53:32 You just get a choker. You just get to be a cool goth kid. It all makes sense now, Third.
Kaladen Shash 02:53:35 I still can't find it.
Cyrus Schwert 02:53:41 I had a choker when I was young. Me too. Did you really think this was less anxiety-inducing?
Dungeon Master 02:53:42 This music is giving me anxiety. I can edit it. Hold on. We'll do that. OK. You can refresh your page. It'll be in your inventory. Yes, I do think so.
Cletus Cobbington 02:54:07 Hmph.
Cyrus Schwert 02:54:15 mm-hmm
Dungeon Master 02:54:23 but I can tell you at this point. A sleek and alien metal, iridescent glimmer over the circle crafted from a fallen meteorite. While attuned to this item, you gain the following properties. You are resistant to psychic damage. As an action, you can grant up to five allies within 20 feet of you to gain resistance to psychic damage for one minute and does not require concentration.
Kaladen Shash 02:54:25 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:54:48 If the wearer spends 10 feet of their movement to jump, their jumping distance is doubled. This can be done three times per long rest. As a bonus action, you can try to telekinetically shove one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do so, the target must succeed on a strength-saving throw. Or be moved 5 feet toward or away from you. A creature can willingly fail this save.
Dungeon Master 02:55:13 And then finally, you can shield your mind from probing thoughts. While wearing this circlet, you can choose whether or not to close your mind. While closed, no creature can detect your thoughts, divine your location, or sense your presence through psychic means. This also shields you from undesired telepathic communications.
Cletus Cobbington 02:55:27 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:55:38 Okay. Who needs, who needs something to attune to? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've got right. Right. The part of the party hopefully will be just fighting and be within range for this. Yeah. Um, yeah, I mean,
Cyrus Schwert 02:55:38 Are you using all your slots already?
Dungeon Master 02:55:49 some people. And again, anybody who is in 20 feet of you will gain the benefit of the resistance to psychic damage.
Leopold Magnus 02:56:05 Yeah. That'll be a nice buff when we fight those mind flayers though. Resistance to psychic damage is huge.
Kaladen Shash 02:56:10 Cyrus or Cleetus, do you guys want to hang on to this? You should wear this. I just put it in the game log. You can find it. Oh, yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:56:15 It's way too big. It still doesn't shrink enough.
Cyrus Schwert 02:56:15 I'm usually up in the mix. I don't mind a choker. I put on the choker.
Dungeon Master 02:56:24 Silence.
Leopold Magnus 02:56:40 I think now we go back.
Cyrus Schwert 02:56:44 My head's dragging on the ground. So heavy. This is fine. Okay. But now. Oh, this has been a crazy day.
Cletus Cobbington 02:56:47 Oh,
Kaladen Shash 02:57:11 That's what I'm talking about. Waiting for that. Get the benefit.
Dungeon Master 02:57:13 And you guys all level up. And it is more like video game mechanics. When you guys level up, you don't need a long rest. You all gain the benefits of the long rest. You get your level up. You reset to max HP. Everything you use resets.
Leopold Magnus 02:57:16 Push it, we level up, nice. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:57:38 noise.
Dungeon Master 02:57:44 Okay, and I'll get one more thing from you before we end. I just need to pull up the right thing for it. I'll let you guys know in a second.
Leopold Magnus 02:57:48 Let's figure out what to do about that.
Kaladen Shash 02:58:02 What's that? Of course. What is it? What kind of effect is this?
Dungeon Master 02:58:17 I need a charisma saving throw from each of you. No effect in specific.
Cletus Cobbington 02:58:28 I'll slow go. A charisma thing.
Kaladen Shash 02:58:35 You have an advantage.
Leopold Magnus 02:58:44 17 for me.
Cyrus Schwert 02:58:47 Is this being charmed?
Dungeon Master 02:58:47 Uh, Cyrus? No, Cyrus, but you do not need to make this save. This is, um, telepathic psychic BS. But you are now shielded from that. And last one will come from Zariel. With a six. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:59:22 That's a note for me. We're going to stop it right there for the night. And you guys would essentially be.
Cletus Cobbington 02:59:29 Nice.
Kaladen Shash 02:59:31 All right, great man. Thanks for running that. That's fun. Made some progress. OK, yeah. We're just at the other. We're at the two door area.
Leopold Magnus 02:59:33 Yeah, that was a lot of fun.
Cyrus Schwert 02:59:36 It rolls hella good on my speech pedia. It sounds great.
Dungeon Master 02:59:43 out of the dungeon if you wanted to. Like in theory we could like speedrun it, you guys grab maybe the book and then you get the circlet obviously and then you leave. So we'll start the next session with you guys going back into the other dungeon if you'd like to. You could also leave.
Kaladen Shash 03:00:08 What? Well. Bunch of mind players. Did get a cool circlet. I mean. We yeah, we we cleared like the very first little zone area.
Cletus Cobbington 03:00:16 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 03:00:21 Yeah, we should probably go fuck him up. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 03:00:24 You already cleared some of it too, didn't you?
Dungeon Master 03:00:31 They've made it. You guys made it. This much of it.
Kaladen Shash 03:00:39 I don't think he gave us like a percentage type thing. There's a lot of that left.
Cyrus Schwert 03:00:54 Yeah, so. Maybe. Come here. Come here. Goober.
Cletus Cobbington 03:01:01 CCB. CCB.
Dungeon Master 03:01:03 That's a good girl. But back to where you are. Being so good right now. Hi, Winston.
Cyrus Schwert 03:01:26 He's sleepy too. He's a shaggy baby. He can't see very good.
Leopold Magnus 03:01:28 Yeah. They're like, ah, it's time for bed. Cool.
Dungeon Master 03:01:32 That's what he looks tired Nicely done anybody get anything cool with their level up
Cletus Cobbington 03:01:46 Better for alligator.
Leopold Magnus 03:01:57 I'm still trying to figure it out.
Kaladen Shash 03:01:57 I got my second attack now. I have my second attack as a fighter. That was big. Good get two point. That's fifth level. Yeah, so I'm level three wizard and level five fighter.
Cyrus Schwert 03:02:00 Nice. Is that a bit level? I don't. I don't know.
Cletus Cobbington 03:02:21 Yep. Yep.
Kaladen Shash 03:02:23 I mean, I'm an elderly night as well, so I got some casting there. Good blend. Alright, that's great. We're on for. Next Thursday, everybody's good. Yeah, tricker. 16th, OK.
Leopold Magnus 03:02:44 That works with me.
Dungeon Master 03:02:46 Mm-hmm. Hoping Jesse feels better. Okay, and then, Bren, rules as written, I don't think you technically get to Eldritch Blast and then full attack action, but since this is something a little bit different, if you are doing two of your melee weapon attacks, you can do one blast as the bonus action.
Cyrus Schwert 03:02:53 for.
Kaladen Shash 03:03:14 That's fine, we'll take that. Yeah, sure, I'm in. All right.
Dungeon Master 03:03:16 Or you can do the three blasts plus the one attack so you can sort of break it up how you want to. Oh, OK guys. Super fun. Kick Craig's ass out of here. He doesn't need to be here.
Cletus Cobbington 03:03:28 What are you doing? Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 03:03:35 Yeah. Thanks everyone. See you later, Craig.

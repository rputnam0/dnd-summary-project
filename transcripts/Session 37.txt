3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:00:01 Are you recording it while we're playing? I said some really incriminating things. Yeah, you guys all left and I was really anti-Semitic. Right into Rex's phone. Laptop.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:00:03 Yeah, I did. I recorded on my laptop. Yeah. Yeah. Guys, that's a really off-color shit. Yeah. It's okay. I'll just ask Craig to edit that bit out.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:00:03 Yeah, he was.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:00:05 And I think back on what you said. Yeah. I went on some really bad rants when everybody was gone. Yeah. It'd be funny if it summarized it as like
2-traceritops.ogg 00:00:14 Bye.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:00:31 He doesn't know who it was.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:00:34 Just like, you know, like racist rant or something. It just categorizes it. That's funny. Thanks. Oh, that's great. That would be funny.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:00:39 there's a, uh, you know, off, um, out of, out of game section that I always have in there, basically tell it to like characterize it so it can ignore it. And it includes a few things like that. So it'd probably show up there and be like the party discussed, you know, a bunch of off color shit. Oh yeah. Cause I had to put that in there after, uh, yeah. Yeah.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:01:01 Barrow Berkshire is a big Elon Musk guy. Yeah. That's funny.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:01:06 I had to include that after Khaled and Sasha's PT aids. What were those two guys' names? They were like summarized in the fucking transcripts. I was like, what the fuck? Yeah, yeah, yeah. The two techs that worked at the clinic, yeah. Cracked me up.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:01:18 Oh, that's funny.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:01:20 I can't remember anymore, yeah. I've rotated through some more of them. Yeah. Yeah. That's funny. That's funny.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:01:33 Alrighty. Uh, last session started with the battle with the, Oh dears taking on the cindered guardian, infernal infused and creature sort of standing in your way of completing your sort of mysterious fave ritual. Um, it was close and at times seemed pretty dire, but ultimately you prevailed the party. Um,
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:02:00 in a moment that originally thought was just going to be cowed in sort of undergoing this learned that each of them with their ties to the, the Pharaoh were also potential candidates essentially. And so each of you got into the nest at the base of the tree and were sort of
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:02:23 turned into these little amber jelly beans that are not small necessarily, but much smaller than your body. And you were teleported to the Faerun, where the Guardians of the Wild had been waiting for the sort of foretold one.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:02:33 Okay.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:02:44 slight bickering and joking before eventually Kaladin's form emerged right as the grove that they were hiding in was attacked by what is essentially the three little pigs and their army of wolves and one by one more people kept coming out and you didn't really know where each one was going to go so each of you with the exception of
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:03:13 I forget who exactly. Oh no, I do have it. Barrow has Kaladin. Gooch has nobody. Portimus has Cyrus. Alabaster is carrying Cletus and Zariel. And Carrick is carrying Leopold. The new party, the Guardians of the Wild, set out towards the...
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:03:38 the path they just kind of know they have to take. So at first you're just traveling horizontally through the forest before you made it to a body of water that you had to cross. You know, your next step takes you out into the Badlands, but before you made it to the Badlands, you discovered that the Cephalords had been quarreling with their aquatic neighbors, the Kenkus. And what they didn't tell you is they both,
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:04:05 simultaneously raided the other one's towns, claimed it as their own, and then promptly wanted their old one back. So they requested each separately for you to kill the other. You very slyly, in order to buy yourself time and to minimize the threat, led the cephalords down into the water as you had led the cankoos up out, and then each small group only had to take out that one subsect of monster.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:04:35 You left the majority of each alive with sort of a silent warning of you got to just stop fucking knock this shit off kind of deal. Before you guys went back underneath the water to the large gate.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:04:50 went through it, and then sort of under the pressure of your impossible timeline that you have been forced into, decided that it was better to just keep pushing yourselves. With some good rolls, you still elected to march through the night with the fear of the constant threat behind you and the knowledge that you'll probably be fine just because you seem to be outpacing everything at this time.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:05:17 So at this point, I have it is that in one full day, you guys had knocked out two days of travel with the extra push. You were just at a day and a half. You made it to two. Everybody had a point of exhaustion.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:05:17 Thank you.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:05:31 to start this second day. But we pick up with you guys sort of taking a short rest in a sort of side alcove, just off the beaten path behind some bushes along a very steep cliffside. And as you guys are sort of panting, sort of, you know, patting your head, stretching a bit, getting some food into your body, it's up to you on what you would like to do next as you guys sort of take back into control of yourselves.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:05:31 Mm-hmm.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:06:02 Unless you want to go by a new name, Guardians, what do you want to do?
2-traceritops.ogg 00:06:08 Just distracting.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:06:19 Um, I don't really know. Rex, you look so different with your hair short. Sorry, but it's crazy. Perfect. That makes sense.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:06:25 Is the other one like a Mohawk?
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:06:29 You know?
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:06:29 oh man god feels so good you don't you haven't known me long enough but i get two haircuts a year so it goes from that to this yeah uh yeah
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:06:48 I've never cut my hair. I just shed. I just shed the long hairs and I grown back. It's just now spring. I'm really getting rid of my undercoat. It's getting all over my stuff.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:06:51 Thank you.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:06:56 That would be awesome. Keep it here. That's good. So we've short rested, right?
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:06:57 I love it.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:07:15 Yeah, so, like, you guys are, like, this is ending sort of a short rest. You, I don't think you had, oh, you did each spend some stuff. You had gotten a short rest at the end of the other one, so you'd already gotten your other, like, you're basically at full capability other than whatever you guys expended. I don't really remember there being a lot of other, I mean, there was combat. Yeah, but you were ultimately without a long rest at this point.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:07:22 Sure. All right. So we're just trying to get these people to our goal. That's the goal really is what we're trying to do.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:07:34 And we've traveled it. Deliver the package.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:07:54 Yeah.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:07:55 Right. And the homies kind of in front of us clearing a path more or less. Right. Okay.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:07:56 For the guardians. Well, then.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:08:04 Yes, you understand that Feylara is sort of kind of carving out, taking up the big threats ahead of you. Not all of them. You guys are capable enough, but Feywild's a pretty dangerous place.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:08:26 Shall we saunter on? As long as you can keep up. Baylor has put a lot of, a lot of respect to you.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:08:31 I have never sauntered, but I would like to try. Gooch, speak up.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:08:32 I guess. I'm still in Artemis.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:08:35 Guardians like roll out. Guardians roll out as I roll away in my shell.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:08:37 Bye.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:08:56 What is Gooch doing? I didn't hear you. And then you just did that ridiculous move. Gotcha. Okay.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:09:01 I said I'm still in Mrs. Shell, like, poking out, and then he started rolling, so I was like, oh, fuck. I didn't like this, this is bad. I'm just clanking around.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:09:04 Oh, shit. You're getting so dizzy. There's so many handles of fireball in there, too. You're just getting banged with bottles. Get out of my shell, dude. Gooch was invited. You were not. I gotta be way drunker for you to get in here, too.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:09:09 Wow. Dude, you got the 30 bottle in there. Peering into the gap where your arm comes up. I'm just seeing what you've got going on in here. You're always in the show.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:09:20 Hold on.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:09:36 Yeah, there's a reason. I'm a fucking turtle. Holy shit. Skin turtle.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:09:40 I can go with my shark through and I pull my arms into my fat little sides. It's my blubber. Calls me technical running backs.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:09:44 Thank you.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:09:49 Skin turtle. Awful. Awful.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:09:50 and turn it off
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:09:56 I can't believe the fate of the realm relies on you guys. Alabaster just starts stomping off. Straighten up, soldier.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:10:05 Hey, like it or not, you're with us, so joke's on you. Jesus Christ. What the fuck?
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:10:10 My fat rolls are jiggling as the earth shakes from you walking. Dude, you're making my tits bounce. I didn't wear my bra today. Well, it's like a tight Under Armour undershirt, but it's basically the same thing.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:10:29 I have some decently. Uh...
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:10:34 Thank you.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:10:34 But you've had it your whole life. So it's so small now. The neck hole of your shirt looks just as tight as my necklace. Cutting off circulation. It'll be all right.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:10:35 compression shirt? No way. You established you went to a school.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:10:42 I play football. There's football in the Feywild, obviously. Your face is a little blue. Are we going to follow the elephant or what? We follow that one.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:11:07 No, I'm good. I'm going to go home. I take a swig and I start rolling in slightly the wrong direction. Gooch, you got to steer me.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:11:09 I'm out of sight. I'm gone.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:11:10 You get so much cardio for being as fat as you are.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:11:12 I don't know everybody's names, but I follow you. Alabaster. Allie, come back. This guy gets physics. I'm like jogging alongside.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:11:23 I'll just try to gyroscopically lean one way, try to get us to roll the right way. Alright, I'll try.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:11:32 We're all
2-traceritops.ogg 00:11:45 All right, we're on our way.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:11:52 okay uh so you guys sort of sit at the cusp of what is the the more wooded jungly foresty area and you know you're gonna have to go sort of south through the badlands to make it to the tree of death in the fey wild which is essentially what is down here um
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:12:03 It was.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:12:17 there will be patches of forest and some areas like underground traveling through like deep, um, canyons. But for the most part, it's kind of like in the very deserted area. It is, um, blistering hot as is was previously the realm of the court of sun. And so it's eternally sunshine outside. It doesn't ever get dark. And so you guys have to trek through an area that is constantly getting beat by the sun. Um,
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:12:45 Once the magic sort of left, it didn't balance out anymore. You don't currently hear anybody behind you. It doesn't feel like immediate pressure of being trapped. You guys made some good ground on that. But how would you like to approach the next leg of your journey?
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:13:03 This isn't related. It's related, but not to that question exactly. I imagine that Alabaster, at the very least, if not more than just Alabaster, has an idea of where we're going. And we're familiar with the land and the path. Thank you.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:13:16 Yeah. You generally know the area. You know where to go. As part of this ritual that you guys kind of, like, blindly were brought into a long time ago, you know that you're kind of just following a path that you just innately know. You know the basic landmarks. You know where you need to end up. But, like, with these beings on your back, you're just kind of, like, straightlining it in the most direct path to it. Like, you have a constant clairvoyance spell going.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:13:17 Yeah.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:13:46 Okay. In this map you just put up is where we are. Or is this like a Okay. Are we looking for like a survival check or are we looking for
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:13:51 Roughly. Badlands. Desert-y. Yeah. Just a change of scenery. Yeah, so same deal. We'll do three successes for three fails. And then depending on how good it is, you'll roll an encounter check. Stopping if you guys want to. If at any point you feel like you need a long rest.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:14:16 Okay.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:14:20 Go for that. But again, the goal is to take down more days than pass. Essentially, you're at the start of day two. I think I said it was nine days to start with. But then one of you rolled in at 20. So I was like, OK, you start with seven instead. So I believe it's five days worth of travel in a seven day span.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:14:45 Oops. And then we can do that. Yeah. Is advantage on skill checks or saving turns?
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:14:46 Yeah. Jonathan, what are we saying a point of exhaustion does? So I'm looking at the new, I didn't realize there was a rule change. It's a minus two to the test now. Right, so now is, so you want to play legacy rules then? Okay. Skill checks.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:14:52 If you look it up... No. Originally, it was just disadvantage. Yeah. Ability check. It is level 1, disadvantage and ability checks. Level 2, movement speed halved.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:14:59 Yeah, legacy is disadvantage. Yeah, I like to pick legacy rules when it's better.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:15:16 Okay, that sucks, but that's fine. Right, right, right. Okay.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:15:17 I was.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:15:22 Level three, disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws. Level four is hit point maximum halved. Level five is movement speed reduced to zero. And level six is death. And it takes one long rest or one greater restoration spell to remove one point of exhaustion.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:15:34 Yeah. I didn't realize how much, as a rogue, needing to hide and shit.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:15:36 So I hear.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:15:45 Yeah, we can't. We got a good start, but if we already have one point, our second point, if we occur, it's just going to slow us down so much. Yeah. Yeah.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:15:46 We got a pretty good head start though. Yeah, we don't want to get too... And our survival checks to get through the next day. I have pretty good survival.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:16:02 like pretty directly affected by even one but i mean you know one's not terrible yeah
2-traceritops.ogg 00:16:07 Think back to Kranen. Start every single round with I hide.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:16:12 um,
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:16:16 I've got pretty good survival. Or no, I have good stealth, not survival. Okay. Okay. That's just fine.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:16:21 I try it.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:16:23 I have a plus 10. I got to rip it first. Okay. Disadvantage. Come on. Let's go. I'm fucking rooting around for triples.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:16:30 I have a negative one, so it's never going to be me. Plus, I'm in a shell. Damn. We're there.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:16:43 How does it disadvantage? Sheesh. Dude, I rolled so hard.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:16:45 How's with this? Let's go. He knows you.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:16:45 Wow.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:16:53 I'm fucking making a mess. I did a survival check. I thought that's what we were around.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:16:53 I'm sorry, are you guys rolling for shit? Let's go. It was. I just was in a different menu. I didn't see it. 26 on disadvantage is fucking nuts. How long do you want to travel? Do you want to have a planned break? You know that 26 is a wild success, so you know that in this travel you're making a ton of ground. How many hours do you want to go before you take a break?
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:17:07 It's insane. How long before we get another level?
2-traceritops.ogg 00:17:26 Are we already two days without sleeping?
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:17:27 Good question, Jesse. I thought you meant a level like we go up to level 10.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:17:28 We've been awake for a day. We have another 24 hour period before we accrue like another point of exhaustion.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:17:36 What was the question, Justin? I would say if you travel more than eight hours without taking a break, you'll get another point of exhaustion. So you could go like four to six hours and then like short rest as like somebody else makes the next check.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:17:39 How long can we go before we get into our level of exhaustion? Oh.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:17:58 We don't want to flirt with another point of exhaustion, I don't think.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:18:01 But if you push it past that, you'd be risking it. It'd be like a constitution saving throw to keep going. Okay. So you're hitting around, let's say you start this day's journey at 8 o'clock or so. You hit about noon to 1 o'clock-ish as you guys sort of take your break.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:18:08 I need .
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:18:11 No, let's push from four to six. Let's go four to six. Yeah, six hours. Good pace.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:18:13 Two six. Yeah.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:18:17 Yeah.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:18:30 It'll be a straightforward short rest. You prevent yourself from getting any more damage. You rehydrate, whatever, all the survival stuff. But somebody give me an encounter check just to see what happens. Okay.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:18:42 Oh, I'm hydrated. All right. I'm feeling. I run so cold. I pour some fireball to make a little fireball mud for you.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:18:43 I've put so much dirt on me to cool myself off over those six hours. It's unbelievable. We were moving pretty quick. I found a mushroom.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:18:48 I would like to add... Oh, nice.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:18:53 Oh, Barrow, there's a good reason we keep you around. Keep those sniffers to the ground, son.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:19:11 You can root around now. I can do it. It's just a straight . Go.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:19:16 Who wants to be in counterattack? Oh, you guys are just rotating through here. I love it. Four.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:19:21 I don't think it can be me. Someone with bad survival. Oh fuck. Tell me that's a good one.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:19:23 Actually, I guess it should be me, yeah, because my survival's dog shit. Because I'm never going to roll. Yeah. Oh, did you already roll it? Is that good? What the fuck?
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:19:26 Just encounter D20. Just a D20, yeah? Ouch.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:19:40 We wanted low on this one.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:19:41 That's fine. It was just like, if you hit a one or something, you wouldn't get the good stuff. Travis's survival was so good that there's a reward coming regardless. But you guys are sort of bedding down
2-traceritops.ogg 00:19:44 Good.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:19:57 chilling sitting around like maybe you make a little fire it's a little fire cantrip and so you're like cooking some beans or some shit and you hear clacking of pans sort of where you were heading to but just down the path initially it's just the sound but then you look up and you see like glinting off the hard sun is like a reflection of something coming at you before you fully see the shape you see like the glinting of something
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:20:25 And then if you keep waiting, you'll see more, but I'll give you the chance to intervene. Gooch is in a hole. Everybody else is just at alert. Pressing over...
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:20:30 I'm digging a hole and climbing in it. Oh, fuck.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:20:33 Bye.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:20:34 And alert, man, something's coming.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:20:39 Okay.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:20:41 I'm going to activate my shell defense.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:20:48 the heat line of the constant sun coming a little bit into better view you see is a daggering one and a half foot tall goblin, um, with a huge backpack of just bunch of random shit. And the thing that you saw glinting was like a, uh, like stainless steel pan just hanging from the top of the backpack. They're just catching the sun.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:21:14 And this figure just seems to be like very merrily kind of just like bounce walking in your direction, whistling a tune to themselves. You're,
2-traceritops.ogg 00:21:25 Is that Gooch the Second? Is that your dad? It catches me off guard every time. Gooch the Second, dude! Over here!
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:21:30 My head up. Dad. In your. Is that is that senior? Church senior. It. Number two.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:21:37 Yeah.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:21:39 That's your dad, dude. Oh, my God. This is going to be fucking nuts. Gooch Jr.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:21:45 you see this guy walks up in the shadow his backpack is huge but again he's like up to your knees and he's got a little name tag that he covers that pretty quickly once he like looks over the crowd somebody give me a perception check to see if you catch what it says everybody can too it doesn't have to be just one person
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:21:50 You know this gentleman?
2-traceritops.ogg 00:21:57 Oh, I had a dirty 20.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:22:14 This disadvantage though, right? Yep. Yep. Everything. All right. That's okay. 16 with disadvantage.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:22:17 Ability check, so yeah. Some high rolls. Anybody who got over 15, you see that his name tag does indeed say Gooch, but he kind of pulls it off to the side real quick. And he goes, my name's Squirt. I'm a traveling merchant.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:22:18 Oh, shit. Disregard. Ooh, still an 18. Sorry, mine were separate, but
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:22:21 Both were bad.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:22:22 Nice. Damn.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:22:29 19, what's this advantage? Dude, your name's Gooch. What's in your pocket?
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:22:44 Squirt. Squirt gooch. I saw it too, man. I looked at it. What?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:22:48 No, I don't never earn a good shit. Hey, he grabs you by your lapel, pulls you in close, he goes, you don't shut the fuck up, I'm not giving you any shit. He's got you on like a fat roll distribution of lapel.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:22:50 I saw your name tag. I saw your name tag. If you think I'm wearing a suit, you're mistaken. I don't have a lapel. I know that makes sense. That makes sense. I do have those. There's beep imprints that are not releasing once you let go.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:22:59 He lets go and your fat is in the shape of a little pillow now.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:23:20 You have plus three pitting edema, full body. In the farewell of the meeting, actually, I prefer that. My name is...
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:23:21 like memory foam that's great i'll pick them up i'll set them down i'll say listen here tell us your real name sir and i'm gonna do an intimidation check uh with disadvantage
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:23:24 I'm like a Tempur-Medic. Tempur-Medic is going to take fucking five hours for those to come out. What are you doing on here, squirt? You got a bunch of stuff.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:23:30 Has anybody watched
2-traceritops.ogg 00:23:48 Yeah, he obviously would. Yeah, they asked.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:23:49 What's in your backpack? Diving in deep.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:23:54 I'm a traveling merchant. Aha, wouldn't you like to know? Alabaster 10. You know, I'm going to give him a character. He's going to give me an insight check on you, Alabaster. This is a made-up character, so go ahead and roll me a d12 for his modifier.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:23:57 The 12 Okay.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:24:00 Yeah, I would like to know. That's why I asked. Yeah, fucking Fortimus has got it right. Plus 20. Ooh, I like that.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:24:15 I know.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:24:24 Excuse me.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:24:24 Plus two. All right. All right.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:24:30 Oh, plus four. Not bad. Insight check. Or he's making an insight check. Okay. Yeah, pretty bad.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:24:32 He will make an insight check with a plus four. He makes one, sorry. He's trying to, it's to see if you kind of shake him down. Eight. A four plus four, so imagination check of ten passes. He
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:24:32 Nice. That's big. He's making it.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:25:02 sighs to himself, and he puts on his name tag that you can see he hand-carved on a wood thing, and he was real proud of it. And on it says, Gooch the Fourth. And he looks at you, Gooch. He goes, it's tough to see you, Dad.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:25:15 yeah he calls he says man you never said anything about this in training your dad man it's weird
2-traceritops.ogg 00:25:16 Dude, dude. Dude, you've been active, dude. Yeah, he's the fourth. Oh my god. Goochception right now.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:25:18 Well, Gooch III, what do you have to say for yourself?
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:25:27 We never proved you were mine. This is speculation. This dude doesn't like anything like me. He looks exactly like me.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:25:29 He calls Gooch dad? Dude, you have a kid? This feels like cold hard facts.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:25:46 You're a shitty dad. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:25:47 It's got your name.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:25:56 I look at his nose. I'm looking back and forth. I don't know Gooch the third.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:26:01 Dude, you both have the same dimples. I bet your daddy knows what's in it. Sorry.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:26:14 I do it. I don't have any money. Yet. That's fair enough. Good question. What about a 20, baby? Yeah.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:26:18 Do we all have a diamond? Oh. I have one. I have one.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:26:19 You reach in? Sure. I'm going to say everybody just straight roll a d20. If you're under 10, you only have one diamond. If you roll over 10, you have two. It's going to be 1 through 10 and 11 through 20. It's death save rolls. Oh, sorry, not death save, but luck rolls.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:26:21 What about 10? Nice.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:26:35 Oh my goodness. No! Nine, that's so tragic. Oh, come on.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:26:45 And everyone's long roll.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:26:48 Three, nine, eight, 20, 10. Barrow, you have three. Oh, you don't spend your diamond. You just reach in. So this is going to work for you. Okay. This is a... There are only five items. There's one for each person to potentially pull. So it's going to be a D4 plus one diamond.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:26:49 I mean, that's crazy. Three of them are under.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:26:54 My pockets are heavy.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:27:03 this new
2-traceritops.ogg 00:27:04 Hard flexed.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:27:15 And it'll be like if somebody picks your number after you do it, you can choose up or down if it's not like the extremes on each side. And you can trade it if you don't like what you want, but this is just to spice it up.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:27:27 Okay. You're saying I'm... I guess I did say. I'm going to roll the net twice. Four. That makes sense. Oh. Gotcha.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:27:37 D4 plus 1. Are we just going to go in the order of what we just rolled?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:27:45 four you reach in and you grab something and it feels like a wooden handle to something and you scare gucci goes ah fuck and you pull out a um not impressive looking but like a
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:27:56 Bye.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:28:07 on the verge of rusting sort of pit marks on the metal, but still looks pristine somehow, like Woodman's Axe.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:28:18 This is fucking sick. It looks like me. I'm all dirty too. Okay. Great. I could try. I swing at a tree. I guess where we're at is probably not. I missed.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:28:24 All 30 yet pristine. Are there any trees? But I can try, walks away for five minutes.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:28:27 I suppose you could chop some lumber with that.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:28:36 There's a tree like 15 feet away. There's a tree, but it's like a walk. It's a little magical, but you can't tell what it does.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:28:37 We're in the desert.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:28:39 There's no trees.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:28:47 OK, so I don't hit the tree. Yeah, it leaves. OK, I will just go with the luck of the draw and not try to redraw.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:28:55 He's here in the distance. Travis has.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:29:06 Okay. Who's next? Who's given up their only diamond? Go ahead. I haven't, but Travis has. Quickest guide, while you guys talk about that, a patient who works at
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:29:15 Has anybody watched... Has anybody watched The Bear? No? Yeah. No?
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:29:17 Oh, it's fucking phenomenal. Excellent. I'm on number four in cooking.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:29:24 The cooking show on FX? Yeah. Ooh, damn. Having a good night.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:29:27 Yeah.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:29:34 Good Life brought us a whole case of sweet ass. Are you? I'm milking one, but I didn't realize we're releasing. Check out your character.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:29:45 Yeah, I will be more talkative tonight, just so we're aware. If I talk over you, I apologize.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:29:46 That's funny. No, I was just going to say, I guess Travis will get it. I imagine that the reason that this kid of mine and I don't act like we know each other is that I'm haunting him, which is a thing where you pretend that they don't exist. It's from the bear. Anyway.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:29:50 Go for it. Ooh.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:30:12 he treats you like you're a complete stranger okay now as the one do you want it to be one or do you want it to be two
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:30:12 Yeah, I remember that. Bad blood, I suppose.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:30:13 It's just like, like he's done something to like a disservice to me and I'm really upset. So I'm just pretending like he isn't real. Anyway. Well, I'll, I'll, I'll give it a shot. It's until he does something to get himself back in my good. I want the bottom of the barrel.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:30:23 the sound.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:30:45 You reach in and you feel like a velvet pouch. Crisp. You can feel the crunch under your fingers as you're grabbing it kind of blindly. And you pull it out and there is a deep purple, red, crushed velvet bag cinched at the top with a sort of like rectangle-ish shape inside.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:30:45 Thank you.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:30:46 shortest number? What'd you get?
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:31:12 Don't mind if I do. Just pull it out. I'm going to let everybody else get theirs, but I want to see what this does. But yeah, continue with that one. Maybe. There's a bad version of it, too.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:31:17 there's a deck of cards in your hand.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:31:17 Stout had something like that way back in the day. It's fun. Definitely.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:31:21 Oh shit. Dude, let's play some Prison Bitch.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:31:24 No time for games, Gooch. We've got to keep moving.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:31:42 We just rolled. I think I'll pick the, I'll go up one, five. Didn't try to pick four.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:31:47 Who's next? Gooch is just sort of leaning on the backpack going, I can do this all day as he collects his diamonds and he sort of just jingles them up and down, drops one. Oh, fuck. He rolled a three plus one, so three plus one, so yeah. Okay, so you'll go to five.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:31:50 Another four. Yeah, I have. I had four as well.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:32:00 Thank you.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:32:18 OK, you reach in. And at first, you're not really sure what you're grabbing, but eventually you're sort of like reaching through stuff like it's like not super grabbable things at first. And eventually you make contact with something and it feels like sort of spherical and very smooth in your hands.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:32:19 Put my hand, put my hand in there.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:32:46 The Family Jewels.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:32:48 just round like an orb. I feel a ball of orb. I'm not very smart. Let's go. Oh, man, I just wasted that diamond.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:32:50 like an orb and you pull it out and you do see that you do in fact have a perfectly round sphere. It reflects all sort of light, like almost like it kind of just takes in light, heavy metal ball. It's really heavy. It's like,
2-traceritops.ogg 00:33:13 I'm going long. Toss it. It's a bowling ball. I'll identify it.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:33:17 I fucking tackle your ass. You might have to attune to it. That's one rip.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:33:19 It's like 12 pounds, like shot put weight. If it gets out to here, it's really straining the elbow. Do you guys want to stop and let him identify? Okay. Who's up next?
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:33:26 Okay. What do I have? Can I identify this thing? No, it's okay. Keep going. We'll do it.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:33:47 Get in there, Tortimus.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:33:48 Okay, so four and five are taken, so you've got to take three. You reach in, and then you find that you are in your hand is a very cool metal object. You can tell pretty quickly because of how identifiable it is. There's like a metal ring that you're holding. As you pull it out, it just seems to be a very simple gold band.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:33:49 Just rolled. Another four...
2-traceritops.ogg 00:33:49 Four as well. Okay, three. Taking three is my real name. Oh, shit.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:34:17 I mean,
2-traceritops.ogg 00:34:19 Are you proposing, Gooch? Gooch the fourth, are you proposing right now? There's no way. All right. I think that's Steph. Wait.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:34:19 You're getting married. You're going to be Gooch IV in law. You're going to be sick. What?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:34:32 He goes, I've never seen that. This bag just takes things from nearby bags and I charge people for it. I mean, this is perfectly legal practice. Anyway, who's next? No, that's not just an axe. That's a pretty cool axe. Who's up next? I'm going to go.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:34:42 Are you a thief? Okay. I'll take something. Great. I just turned him upside down. There's only one thing left. I'll just shake him.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:34:49 I paid a diamond for a rusty axe. Your hand doesn't fit in the bag. Oh, yeah, there you go.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:34:49 We're the guardians. Put your hands behind your back, Gooch. Your hand is so big. That was also a four.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:35:07 It's.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:35:08 The only thing is to you reach in and you feel is like also very round, but it is kind of like hairy.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:35:09 It puts the trunk in. It puts the trunk in.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:35:15 Two? All right, yeah.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:35:26 you
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:35:28 husk ish and at one point you feel like there is a string tie holding it together so um for you pull it out and there is coconuts that are cut in the middle but they seem to be tied together i mean if you wanted to
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:35:45 Like, clack them together like horse hooves? Is that kind of the idea? What is this? Some kind of joke, Gooch? Come here, Barrow. And I just slap him on his titties. Take those two coconuts.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:35:49 Barrow, are you neutered, or... This guy's got your balls, dude. That's awesome.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:35:55 Thank you.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:36:01 What?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:36:01 Listen, you get what you pay for. And with that, he just starts walking. I don't have tips. He's got like, he's like at least a secret.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:36:14 No, no, on barrows. And then I take the straps and I tie it around. I was tired of looking at those knockers. Now let's get a move on.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:36:18 Let's have a luau. Let's go one by one. We're all doing it.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:36:22 you're always just trying to go go go dude when are you gonna like fucking enjoy life
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:36:30 Blow down. Yeah.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:36:31 You do have the chance to identify and do stuff if you want. This is part of a short rest. Now that everybody's pulled something, who would like to attune to their items? I imagine everybody would. On my screen, top to bottom, left to right, is Trace currently. Trace, you pulled up the ring. Okay, tort.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:36:53 My name is Tort, Mr. DM. Thank you. My goodness.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:37:00 tort. I'm going to make this worse if you don't stop. You have a ring of fire detection. The range on this ring is touch. When you cast this spell, you can detect the nearest fire. This ring also grants you fire protection. I mean fire resistance.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:37:03 Uh huh.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:37:09 Oh, my God.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:37:18 Yeah.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:37:26 Oh my god, I'm resisting my own fuel. I'm always at a perfect neutral heat now. What's up, Arrow?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:37:35 Oh yeah, nobody knows you do that. Next up on my screen is Barrow. You grabbed...
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:37:45 It's me Barrow again. What's up guys? I had to stop. So sick. Correct.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:37:49 You have the axe. This is an axe of returning, an item that I believe you've used before. It is an axe that, when thrown, returns the user to the axe, range 30 feet. So he throws it, and it automatically yanks him directly to the handle. To the axe. Next.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:37:55 It's fucking awesome. Fucking awesome.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:38:12 The user goes to the X.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:38:15 That's right.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:38:17 I am used to the mechanic. It is very fun. Item.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:38:20 dialed next up is Carrick you had the orb on the five this is an orb of annihilating it is a single use item that when thrown destroys the item that it is coming in contact with you could try it on a person
2-traceritops.ogg 00:38:43 Oh shit. I am so glad you did not just throw that at me when I asked. I'm so glad that thing's really heavy.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:38:43 destroys an item not a being an item not a creature okay it's like a grenade just
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:38:50 interesting that would be crazy
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:39:04 Next up is Gooch the Third. You pulled out the deck. Oh, no, sorry. Next up on my screen, that would be Alabaster. And you pulled out, which one was yours? You have the coconuts. That's right. These are another favorite, maybe my most favorite item, the Click Clack Coconuts.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:39:21 Hell yeah.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:39:24 Was your character bracken? Is that right? Yeah.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:39:24 like coconuts.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:39:24 Yep. Okay.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:39:31 All of the mechanics from Monty Python, essentially, except that when you click them, you and your party move at the speed of a horse. You must have both hands available, and it only functions while they are clacking. That was Bracken. Next up, Gooch the Third.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:39:54 That was an early one too. Nice.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:39:55 Oh, shit. I thought it was going to be what Stout had, the imaginary Conrad thing.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:39:56 How much you've fallen. Bracken, Tingle, Torch, Gooch the third. You pulled... I mean, you know what this is. You've got a deck of many things. Um...
2-traceritops.ogg 00:40:10 Sick.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:40:12 He just whips the card out. You can. Yeah. Yeah.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:40:21 What does a deck of many things do?
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:40:22 Oh, gotcha. Oh, it's the fucking most game broken thing. Yeah, it's like you pull one and it's like, oh, there's bubbles everywhere or you pull one and it's like the world ends. I think there's a card where. Yeah, there's a card where like the universe just stops existing.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:40:25 That's crazy. That's insane. You can go between death and a wish fell. Basically. You're trapped in a fucking prism in the nine hells. That's crazy.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:40:26 You pull a card and it has an effect. There are, I believe, 12 cards and they get reshuffled. 13 cards, sorry.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:40:42 Fireball. Oh, yeah. No, not at all. This last one just sounded like a crow is crocking.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:40:52 Well, that would be unfortunate if you got that one. Kurt! Kurt!
2-traceritops.ogg 00:40:53 High risk, high reward. Nice.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:40:54 I would like to mention that I am not the smartest person. I just now put together that all of Bren's characters have had K games. I don't know if anybody else has noticed that. Is that on purpose? Okay. All right.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:41:07 Is that on purpose? Okay.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:41:13 So, sorry. Get ready.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:41:21 He apologized for it the first time he created it. He told us his character's name. Sorry, this one, this deck in particular is the 22 card deck. This is the expanded one. That's the list I chose. Roll me a d100. d100.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:41:29 never apologize. I'm really peckish. I hope it's a bagel.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:41:33 All right. Well, I don't know what it is. It's Gooch. So I'm just going to pull one real quick. Oh, do I know? It's not an attunement, is it? It's just a wondrous item, right? Yeah, I don't think I know. I don't think I know what it is.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:41:40 Oh my god. A tuning feels like you know. No, not me.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:41:49 No, you don't get to attune to this. He could have pulled the card right away. You have to declare how many cards you pull before you pull a card. So you're pulling one card. When you pull a card, it's yours.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:42:01 I just I'm just messing with it unless somebody in the group knows what it is. Oh, sorry. Go ahead.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:42:08 No, that's okay. These are just the rules. This will be established. So pull the card. Card disappears. You draw as many as you can. The person who declares suffers the consequences if there are some. So if, for example, Gooch pulled a card that teleported him away, somebody else could walk up and finish his pulls. And if there was a bad effect, it would affect Gooch. If it was a good effect, it would affect Gooch.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:42:09 I'm
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:42:33 So if it was whatever the gem one does where you get a bunch of gold, that affects wherever he is. So it is cards pulled for character have to be completed. So Gucci pulled one card. He takes off the mask. He's just Goose North. 73.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:42:37 Yeah. Backup character, right? Just in case. We all have one.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:42:37 Thank you.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:42:46 Gotcha. It's Gooch the fourth. I take off the backpack and I play. 73. I've been here the whole time. It is. Thanks, guys.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:42:54 Yeah.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:43:02 Thank you.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:43:06 Is that a Game Changer reference? What a deep cultural cut. You're like, I know what it is. Right.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:43:10 Shannon showed me a full two minute video on her way out of Game Changer as if I hadn't already seen it. I was like, no, this is really great, but you should watch this. You pull the sage card. At any time within one year of drawing this card, Gooch the third can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:43:23 if,
2-traceritops.ogg 00:43:40 Oh, shit. Dude, these cards are sick. Keep pulling them. Pull another one. Dude. I burp really loud.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:43:41 Hmm.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:43:41 You're dumb, but it's valuable. Does he know? Does he share the information about the deck of cards? That was magic. Magic fully exists.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:43:46 And you see that card sort of floats up in the air and there's like gold coming off of it. And then the car goes and it disappears, but you know, you still have access to it.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:44:00 I think this might be a magical deck of cards.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:44:15 Yeah. Did you hear that, dude? I fall over. Okay.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:44:17 Like an elf. Did you hear that? If it's magic, then what? Like, what happened? Okay.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:44:20 Anytime within the next year.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:44:33 Oh, I'm like smart in the future, but not now. Yeah. I should.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:44:41 I don't know that makes no sense.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:44:49 Dude, that's awesome. I hold. I hold.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:44:54 Well, Gooch, you're a strange, funny little man. Let's carry on, man. We've got a job to do. And I start clacking my coconuts and just take off at the speed of a horse. Fucking just jet out of there. What's that? Oh, okay. Okay.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:44:54 I look at Carrick. One story. An elephant galloping.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:45:02 How... Oh. Who's carrying me?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:45:08 alabaster give me a survival check if you lead it give me a survival check if you're leading go ahead gooch why aren't you walking
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:45:14 Disadvantage. Yeah, he's so little. He's really just really tricked it in.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:45:23 With disadvantage, unfortunately. Who's carrying you? He's faster than we are. His legs are for show. We've learned that in training.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:45:25 With this advantage. Well, that's great. That's great. That's exactly what we needed. Yikes. Some low rolls today.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:45:30 You can chill in my shell still if you want.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:45:35 I don't walk. I just whip out a calf that's just the most shredded little tiny calf you've ever seen.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:45:38 I don't want. Huge as a carrot. I don't want. The bones kind of grip you at the neck. I don't want.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:45:53 You gotta preserve those puppies I put you on my fucking shoulders. Your legs are like 180 degrees to get around my thick neck.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:45:57 Oh, this thing? It's a tiny scraggly little leg.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:46:06 Just didn't.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:46:09 light pressure um six as you guys are marching out um you uh we'll use the same map but you hear some whistling from like the top of the canyons as you see some shadows sort of kind of peering over and it's all like
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:46:30 wannabe sort of bandit talk like hello we fucking found them hell yeah and you some dudes like yeah i can't wait to stab them and it's just like a bunch of like rowdiness above as you have been discovered by some sort of group in the area and one by one they drop down and they start giving you their story you see there's like
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:46:36 you
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:46:55 a kind of gothy like uh summer legend where their hair is down it still burns like an ember and they look fairly strong but like their hair is like brushed over their face as they're like i once was alive when the
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:46:57 What the fuck?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:47:10 plans were so green now they're not and pulls out like a fire sword uh the next one that drops down is a snake that's just on fire with a little hat on and it's got like a gun at its side and it goes when i was little my parents were stabbed i used this gun to exact revenge and it shoots a couple of rounds in the air and it's like fully loaded just like pop pop
2-traceritops.ogg 00:47:16 Typekit. Nude.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:47:39 The next one is a wolf that's like on all fours and it starts talking, but it's just in like dog, like it's like in wolf, like it's howling and sort of like that chuffing at the mouth. And it's just like, it's like going on this long narration that nobody understands. And eventually it stops talking and it kind of wipes its eye with a napkin as it started crying at some point. And then it kind of braces itself for battle, um,
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:47:40 Sorry.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:48:08 Everybody go ahead and roll initiative, and then we'll take a quick break. Initiative is a dexterity check, so yes, you do. That was a tough question to ask because I wasn't going to remember it.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:48:18 Damn it, owl bastard. Fucking teacher's pet, dude.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:48:18 Do we roll that with disadvantage too? Damn. Well, you know. I'm all about the rules. Shape up, men. Stiffen your spine, Tornimus. Get ready for battle.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:48:21 Dude, you know I didn't do my homework. You know I didn't do it.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:48:30 eight.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:48:49 Joke's on you. You wouldn't even know if I stiffened it or not. I... I go fully in my shell. What's up, dude? I hand you my flask.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:48:49 man stop being so excited about it jonathan did we have any did we have time to attune to our items or or does my little
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:48:55 These foes will face my blade.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:49:01 I'm in here still. Just shaking.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:49:05 You get sucked in.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:49:06 Yes. Yours is a one-time use. Yes, but you really don't know the extent of what it does yet.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:49:18 slaughter ball only had like a one-time use and no other things because okay so i just have i just have a grenade i just have a one object well i'm gonna pocket it
2-traceritops.ogg 00:49:34 I just added a... Oh, shit.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:49:35 Are those going to get dropped into our inventory per chance? I can't remember, but... Okay. I mean, you got a good idea of what it is.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:49:41 If you reload your character page, you should have something, yes. Except for... There was one person. Carrick, I didn't get to yours yet. Yes, and your Barbarian Influencer, I'll just tell you what I was going to do right now. You get...
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:49:55 That's okay. I have a grenade. I'm not going to touch it yet.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:50:08 double rage modifier when you go into a rage so i believe at this level it's a plus three maybe it's a plus four so that'll be a plus six or plus eight while you are wielding the sword with two hands you also requested a shield so you would have to remove your shield to wield your sword dual-handed and you get the extra bonus and there'll be some that i'll throw in there everybody's kind of built in pieces and i hadn't figured out what to do with barbarian influence stuff yet
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:50:29 The extra damage. No, that's right. That's okay. Could I be able to hold it one-handed and swing it as though it did two-handed damage? Okay. Okay. All right. No, that's great.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:50:38 We're taking a break.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:50:47 No, because that's what Rex's special item does, essentially. Yeah.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:50:56 Is that, oh, I didn't realize that. Sweet. I didn't realize that was a two handed weapon. I thought that would just be for flare. That's that's sick.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:50:57 I have to look at my, I have to see what my modifier or the bonus is right now. But yeah, I don't remember. Yeah.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:51:08 I should have done the same thing. Nice.
4-jessev567890.ogg 00:51:13 Alright, cool. I gotta go get the charger for this thing.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:51:23 No, that's the only thing you asked for, was a one-handed weapon that did two-handed damage. That makes sense.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:51:29 Yeah, so I could wield the shield. Gives me an AC of 20. Yeah. This one's just wearing heavy plate. Well, this one's a paladin, so it contracts.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:51:44 That's good, man. Both your characters are so hard to hit. It's fucking rad. Jonathan, it's plus three right now. You're right. It's plus three right now. The bonus to rage damage is plus three. That's rad. Cool, cool, cool. Would that take an action?
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:51:51 It seems to be a focus for you.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:51:55 Excuse me. So sorry.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:51:59 What was that? Okay. So you get a plus six. And can you, you could definitely do two attacks per action and you, do you have a bonus action attack with your rage subclass?
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:52:21 I don't think so. Let me look at features and try to pull it up right now.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:52:25 everybody sort of has a, like a, a charge kind of capacity. I'll say that as part of your charges twice a day, when you go into a rage, you can do, uh, like in that rage, if it drops, you lose it while you were raging. You can do a bonus action attack. Like you sort of borrow the, um, uh, the frenzy barbarian trait.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:52:50 That's right. I'll take that. Yeah, because I do bolstering magic, magic awareness, and then that's it. Those are the things my little subclass does. But I'll take the extra bonus action hit.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:53:20 Thank you.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:53:50 Did you guys finish out the round all right yesterday? Yeah. Really? That's crazy.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:53:55 I ended at three or four over. I went on kind of a bogey run, but did all right overall. I was hucking it on hole 15. I was pin high, but I really thought it was going to go into the fucking street. Yeah, did not think it was going to do that. That was crazy.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:54:02 Oh, that was fun. In front of some people. It was gliding so well. It looked like it was going street deep. Yeah. It was really funny because then this guy that watched them throw because they walked up with their dogs was like, oh my God, did you see that?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:54:28 Yeah. Yeah, he was so impressed. He's like, I just keep going. Oh, can we talk about that?
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:54:28 That's awesome. A compliment to someone else about you feels good.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:54:30 He was talking to his wife. It was so funny. He was like, oh, my God. I mean, did you see how far that went? Oh, my God. I was like, yeah. What?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:54:42 It was crazy, but I didn't want to take it because they were like 100% unapologetically were like, no, we're just going to walk down the fairway. Like, let us get through this. Pardon us without stopping. And then they only had to stop because their dog started shitting in a bush and they couldn't go anywhere. Oh, for sure. We're taking forever to get to it.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:54:58 Right next to the tee box. I'm pretty sure they just waited for us to throw and just left it. Yeah.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:55:00 Let's see.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:55:02 you you
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:55:28 Yeah. Yeah, that's perfect. That's what you had us put in the inventory. I've got a plus one long sword right now.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:55:35 Anybody have any qualms about the stuff they got? Bren, yours would be whatever weapon you wanted damage type wise with things we talked about. And then everybody's weapon is a plus one. So plus one to attack and damage. That holds true.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:55:59 Yeah.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:55:59 In the items that we just got from Gooch the 4th, are those in there as well? That one, I know you had some left. Not that you have to find it. I remember what it does. My only question for that one is, can I wield that one-handed, or is that a two-handed?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:56:05 I don't think those exist. I might have. Those might exist in my old D&D Beyond creations. I'm pretty sure the axe for turning is something that's in there. It's a one-handed weapon. It's a light weapon.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:56:33 Okay.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:56:45 um
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:56:46 Okay.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:57:04 And the click-clack coconuts might also be an item that you can add. He might have been a custom one. Hmm? It's not an item. I think horses have a base speed of 60.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:57:12 Jesse had it for sure. You definitely made both of them.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:57:14 If that's what they do, they just make you travel. It was to be a horse. Good point. 60. Does that reduce our exhaustion that we take when we're when we're moving?
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:57:18 What's the movement speed on a horse? What's the movement speed on the horse?
2-traceritops.ogg 00:57:24 you
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:57:42 You thought about it.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:57:42 You're just next checks their DCs are lower if you're doing that. No. Thought about it.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:57:47 Okay. Does that apply in combat if I'm clacking them? Okay. I mean, because that could be pretty important considering it would double my walking speed.
2-traceritops.ogg 00:58:13 you you
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:58:16 It doubles the party's walking speed, which is why it'd be crazy. No, only the person with the coconuts clacks them. Yeah. No, it's an existing item and concept. It'd be cheap.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:58:18 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, everyone. Well, yeah, assuming they're not a monk.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:58:22 But all of us have to be click clacking in unison. It's funny. That's too bad. You should have said yes.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:58:54 what is the addition for I think it's just the view
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:58:56 Is that a plant on your ceiling? Oh, that's sick. Oh, hell yeah. Yeah, we got to get we have a lot that are hanging out. Oh, nice Monstera.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:59:03 Yeah, there is a plant up there. There's two. We have a lot of plants. There's like a jungle right here. We have this stack, the Monstera, little Monstera, snake plant situation. Lots of things over here. And then we've got a couple of
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:59:22 Oh, yeah. I had one of those but Megan didn't like inside. So we left in the garage over winter and then it lost all sleeves. It's grown back. It's got little buds. snake plants are those are the bomb. You don't have to do much for him. Yeah. Yeah, I got this one as like a sprout and COVID.
6-bfschmity.ogg 00:59:26 Okay.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 00:59:31 Oh, no. Yeah. We do well.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 00:59:33 Couple snake plants in the bedroom back there. Other stuff. We have a lot. For sure. Yeah, they don't die. It's pretty hard to kill one.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 00:59:52 So it's been growing quite a bit.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:00:02 Thank you.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:00:09 you you you
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:00:29 Trace, how did you roll so low on initiative? What was your number? Bummer. Teacher's back.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:00:36 You don't have to... I got a seven. I have plus three. Because someone reminded you that we're disadvantaged. Eater's pet.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:00:55 Only Alabaster can do that.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:01:22 For those who didn't know, which would be Bren and Rex really, Trace maybe to some extent, these items were all the original item list on what I gave the first party in my first campaign from like the first traveling merchant they came across. Thought it would be fun.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:01:39 That's cool. That's fun.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:01:41 Touch the fire.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:01:44 I think I'm confusing. I do remember the fire detection ring, but then there was also like a, someone had the cock ring, but I thought that like actually had like fireball spell on it as well. Same campaign, different rings.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:01:45 I remember. That was me and it did have Fireball. Yeah.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:01:53 That was from a god. That was from a god. That was like half of... What was her name? I forget it now, but yes. No, I think...
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:02:15 Rex. No, that is... Yeah. Yeah, I remember the fire detection range touch. For sure. Because we only had four characters, so... I got two things, I think.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:02:18 Doubt also had the ring of fire detection on his dick as well. He had multiple cock rings. Genonically. And I think that was one of them. The new one was Bran's item.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:02:23 Mostly relating to fire. Yeah.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:02:48 Hmm.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:03:01 Bren, you, well, I guess Carrick would feel, he would know that there's like an inherent range of danger, like an area of effect. So you would know not to like throw it at somebody right in front of you.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:03:09 Okay.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:03:12 Okay. My danger sense told me that. Yeah. Okay.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:03:23 Yeah, you just, you're like, this is, this is like, grenade is the most apt term, even though you don't have grenades. Despite the fact that this guy over, this fire snake has a Glock that's like, unrelated. His parents were stabbed, so he is out seeking revenge, and he wields a gun. And he's a snake that's on fire.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:03:30 Thank you.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:03:38 Okay, so what was that guy's deal he was just like shooting fucking bullets off into there He's taking it out on everyone he comes by
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:03:53 I don't understand what you don't get. Yeah, essentially. Yeah. When I had thought of what to do enemy-wise at lunch today, when I was just thinking about it, I was like, I want the snake to have a gun.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:04:03 I pictured him as like the rattlesnake from Rango, just on fire. Because why not?
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:04:11 The fingers rattling on the trigger.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:04:14 Okay.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:04:23 All right. I am here. Thank you. I also love the detail of his parents got stabbed, so he brings...
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:04:23 Just cuz. Welcome back, sir.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:04:39 you
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:04:53 Yeah, of course. Yeah, they were stabbed, so he fucking shoots everything. Okay. Up first on if you guys are ready.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:04:54 I like that a lot. Like the opposite of Batman. That is funny. Yeah. Like opposite Batman. It's like the parents with a gun. Now I punched. Yeah.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:04:56 Well, it's probably because they didn't bring a gun to a knife fight, and now he'll never not bring a gun to a knife fight.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:04:56 you
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:05:23 Any qualms? Keep going. The word will day. Do you get an eight? You are not up first.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:05:26 Yeah.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:05:27 No. Nope.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:05:30 Oh, can you change me to an eight on the initiative?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:05:50 Up first, you see is this... I don't know why it's not... It's just like a weird random thing, but the wolf. It turns out to be pretty huge when it's up close to you guys. It sprints forward, muttering something under its breath that you fully just don't understand. And mid-run...
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:06:15 it's, like, analyzing all of you, and Tortimus Tort, it looks at you, and as it's running, it, like, has one paw up in the air, and you can swear it points at you. And it goes like this. And then, uh, we'll see if it has enough movement. It's pretty far. It only gets to, like, that much further on its turn. So it'll dench. And it gets to you, and you notice that as it, like, passes Gooch, Gooch, if you allow, it gets on its hind legs, and it gets into, like, a stance.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:06:33 What the fuck?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:06:49 But after variant is Barrow. Yes. He's fully not even looking at you. Okay.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:06:53 Oh, he's up in our business. Yeah, I'm going to hit this fucking thing. Welcome to it. Hey, I know you want to fight me. And I fucking jab it a couple of times. Try to at least.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:07:19 Roll to hit. Oh, sorry. 15. 15 hits. Nice. 10 does not hit.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:07:19 Dab underneath it with this guy. Okay, I'll just do both, just because. And I try to slash across it with the axe that I just got. Okay. So I roll for that damage, 10 damage with my sticker.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:07:50 And there's an effect with my new magical weapon that will go on his turn, not mine. And that's my turn as Barrow. Oh! Stab into Barrow. I think so. Maybe. Let me see here.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:07:59 Nice.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:08:02 Is it the one that takes three hits, that one? I think Trace has got a similar mechanic, so I think I've made it equally powered. It's got to be three contacts. That's all right. After that?
2-traceritops.ogg 01:08:17 Bye.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:08:19 Oh, I see. That's true. Yes. I just didn't read the details. Yeah.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:08:31 You only get one attack. Oh, you rolled both. That's right, second one missed. After that, the goth emo Summer Eladrin moves forward their full distance, and from the top of the gulch goes, Hey! Stop! He's like the best of us! Quit it! And he's going to...
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:08:55 I'm going to fuck him up, dude. Shoot it. Shoot the fat guy. I get it. Hey, I failed.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:08:58 He probably has a ranged effect. He's got a longbow. He's going to shoot you, Barrow, because you're the only one that's actually done anything yet. That is a 23 to him. Jesus. You take 14 points of piercing damage.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:09:04 Well,
2-traceritops.ogg 01:09:13 Dude, he actually learned how to use the bow in his archer class. Yeah, he really learned how to use the bow in his class.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:09:24 Mm-hmm.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:09:26 Jesus.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:09:26 14. Okay. That feels like a lot. That's all right. Holy hell. I should have learned how to use that. I'm a ranger, dude. I don't even have a bow.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:09:29 After that, it's Alabaster. Yes, sir.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:09:46 This to me? Ooh, all right. Since I'm kind of new to Apollo, how does the smiting work? Do I have to do that before or after I hit? Excellent.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:10:00 No, that's the great thing about a paladin is when you make contact, you decide if you smite, like you channel it at the point of contact. So there's never a wasted smite. And even on the ones that you have to cast, like if you bonus action branding smite on top or something like that, for example, if you miss, you don't lose your concentration on branding smite.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:10:01 Pretty sweet.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:10:26 I see. Oh, I guess I don't even really have that right now for some reason. I don't even see a smite. I may not have. I don't think I did anything.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:10:31 Did you pick your spells? Well, smites just are like in your features and traits. It's not a special attack. It's just based at first level, it's 2d8 damage, radiant damage. Second level smite is 3d8 damage.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:10:33 Mm hmm.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:10:47 you
2-traceritops.ogg 01:10:48 Thank you.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:10:53 A third-level smite is 4d8, and a fourth-level smite is 5d8. At fourth level, you can upcast it, but the max you'll do is 5d8 extra damage. Unless you cast Branding Smite on top of it, and then you've got 2d6 on top of that, plus your damage dice, which is as high as it is. And I think...
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:11:04 Yeah, OK, I see here. Amendment two handed or OK.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:11:09 That's it.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:11:15 maybe not yet but paladins if you only were straight paladin by then you have the improved might which gives you an extra d8 you might not have that yet at all won't be
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:11:33 Yeah, I see, I see. Yeah. All right. So with that, I am going to move in position. Would I be able to get flanking if I move behind here? Okay. Yes. Yeah, I just have to find somebody. So I'll move in behind this character and I'll say, your rate of terror ends now, son.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:11:45 Yeah. Oh, you don't have it yet. So you just have the normal divine. Right.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:11:48 Thank you.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:11:51 Thanks.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:12:01 And I will unsheath a gigantic sword, which is for the group called Ivory Ed. It is just this shimmering white ivory sword. It comes out of this latinum sheath. And I just kind of lunge back and just take a giant cut right into his shoulder, kind of where his neck meets his shoulder.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:12:02 Son?
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:12:25 Holy shit.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:12:34 Roll to hit with advantage. 13 misses. Give advantage. 22 hits.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:12:37 With advantage 22 would hit though. Yeah Excellent. So I will then also use its special ability which is I'm in a roll of d6 and that will hurt me and then I'm gonna roll d20 in place of the damage die He's one of his charges
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:12:42 Oh, that's hot.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:13:02 I am.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:13:06 So I'm going to take five damage. So you kind of see this blood, my veins and my trunk and my arm just kind of like pulsing into the sword. The ivory goes from like pristine white to kind of this shimmering crimson. And I'll come right down onto him. And then I will roll a d20 as the damage. Come on.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:13:07 What?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:13:07 You take five points advantage.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:13:12 Okay.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:13:33 Now you know that ivory wasn't ethically sourced.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:13:37 Yeah, that's definitely blood ivory. Yeah, that was worse than if I just rolled regular damage. Damn. Well, so does it say you still add your normal damage modifier? Okay, so I'd add plus four to that. Yes. Yes.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:13:39 Elephants were in the making of this film.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:13:48 That's the risk. Do you want to smite? Yeah. So seven. Well, it's a plus one weapon. So what's your strength? Probably plus four. Plus four or five. Oh, so then three plus one is plus four. That makes sense. Okay.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:14:09 Strength is plus... Oh, yeah, plus 3. 17 is my strength. Plus 3. Yeah. Yeah, plus 3. Yeah, for that attack, I will. Yep. I'll just do that at the first level. So that would be... 2d8. All right.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:14:18 Okay, so yeah, seven plus four, and then do you want to smite? What level smite are you casting? Okay, so add 2d8 to that.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:14:26 Picturing a really big elephant casting spells is really funny.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:14:40 2d8 wow smiting is pretty powerful fuck me dude super low rolls today
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:14:47 His trunk is growing. Oh my god.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:14:53 oh man the really big sword is like such a heavy swing and you see the wolf sort of catches it in its paws and there's like a trickle of blood down its wrist as it like holds against and the ground kind of breaks a little bit under its feet but it doesn't quite give it pushes it off ready for the next thing uh
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:14:58 Probably said something really cool. We can't understand it.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:15:17 Ah, you lupine. You will die. And then I'll kind of swing around my sword. I'll do like a pirouette with a sword in my hand. I'm just going to kind of spin around and try to make another slice at him with my second attack. Yep. And with advantage.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:15:22 You did a total of 13 damage. You have a second attack.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:15:48 Okay, 24 to connect. I'll just roll a regular old hit. Look at that. Same damage as the previous strike. So you want to make that one also divine, or is that only a one-time thing? I'll do another smite.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:15:48 There you go.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:15:51 And you can smite again if you want. No, smiting happens on an attack. If he casts a special smite, you can do it. Have you been limiting your character pretty hard then? Smites happen on any attack you contact with.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:16:02 I thought it was a bonus question. Yeah, I guess.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:16:07 I think there's certain things you can do that do take the bonus action economy, but regular Smites, I don't think they do that.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:16:21 Damn God here Yeah, there's total 15
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:16:25 Yeah, so branding, blinding, fire, all of those are bonus action concentrate until you hit. Divine Smite is just when you make contact. You channel power. You did four more damage. After...
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:16:43 For the first time, he's realizing the weight of the two bodies on his back. As he goes to swing his sword, he just doesn't quite have the grace he had before. The wolf kicks up like its hind leg, grabs the sword with its toes, and pushes it back at you. Minimal damage on the second one. Looking hurt, but not on death's door.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:16:54 Okay.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:16:59 Dude, put those grippers away.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:16:59 Oh, my God. Careful. Careful, man. This foe is formidable. Much stronger than he would look. That's my turn.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:17:14 Up next is Fire Snake. How much movement does this guy have? 30. Perfect. He's going to climb down. It's 15 feet, so double movement. 30 feet to get to the bottom of the hill. He looks kind of winded. It takes him a long time. Normally, a single turn all happens within six seconds, but you guys all kind of watch him descend.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:17:42 His tail slips at one point and rocks kind of scatter and he catches it and stops and then continues to move down and eventually hits the ground and sort of like out of breath and he pulls out his gun and he shoots out an alabaster. I'll just give him the same modifiers, you guys. That's a 25 to hit.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:18:04 Thank you.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:18:06 all right i'm gonna take a swig of fireball get all warmed up i'm gonna
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:18:06 Jesus fucking Christ. It hits.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:18:17 You take nine points of piercing damage. After that tort, you're up.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:18:20 Peace.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:18:36 activate my Wolverine claws. I'm gonna point one of them at this fucking wolf. I'm like, anyone ever say pointing's rude? Well, I'm gonna do it right back, bitch. I'm gonna swing at him. Oh my god, not one. Oh my god. That was karma. I also was told that it's rude.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:18:44 oh damn it yeah yeah
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:18:46 Thank you.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:18:53 I rolled the hit. Give me... Was that with your left hand or your right hand? Which hand did you swing with? Uh...
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:18:56 Yeah. And lose that hand. Falls off.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:19:08 It was the wrong one for sure. Left.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:19:17 Yeah, sorry, Don. Holy shit!
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:19:21 Barrow, your AC is higher than nine, right? That doesn't hit you. Just goes right behind Barrow's back. And you see, like, you guys have fought with Thornton before. When he swings his claws, there's like a trace of fire in the air from where the claws kind of slash through. As Thornton has the ability to light his claws on fire through whatever means. I don't think you've asked.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:19:25 Oh, that's great. Wild swing.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:19:27 Mm hmm.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:19:45 You see on one of my claws, one of my claws has the ring and it starts to glow. I'm like, holy shit, there's fire here. I know it for sure. I'm going to swing again. All right, I learned my lesson. I'm not going to point this time. 30, 20.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:19:47 I suck in my back like most people can suck in their stomach. I just miss it. There's a fire in my heart.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:19:52 Roll again. 30, 20 hits.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:20:07 Peace, peace, peace, peace.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:20:09 Hmm.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:20:17 Do I have to declare Stunning Strike before I swing? It just says when you hit. Okay, cool. I'm a Stunning Strike. So he has to make a con saving throw. DC 14. Here's my damage. Oh, a 1. That's cool. 7 damage. Oh, he's stunned.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:20:21 Nope. Stunning Strike happens when you hit. Same as this might. Monkton Paladin. Con save is 10 total, so he fails. 10 damage too.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:20:25 Thank you.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:20:40 Nice.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:20:48 You're stunned, dude. And then... Huh? 7 damage. But let's see. I'm going to bonus action Flurry of Blows and take a couple unarmed strikes here. 15 minutes.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:20:53 You said 10 damage? 15 hits.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:20:56 So.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:21:09 Is that because you suck them into the shell?
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:21:13 Let's go.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:21:18 Okay, that's good damage. Nine damage. Okay, here's one more bucko. Oh. Wait, what the fuck? What did I get? Oh, it landed on a two on my screen. Okay, interesting. We will take it. Oh, another nine.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:21:28 25 hits. 18 plus 7. Looking so hurt. You slap, slash, and then like open hand slap twice to avoid hitting them with the claws on the second ones.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:21:47 I'm gonna swig some fireball and spit it at him. Yeah. I put away my really strong claws to just bitch slap him. Ugh.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:21:58 really so hurt because otherwise I think maybe just going forward we say you always get your claw attacks or something just because like it's just always like just like and then you like kick them a couple times maybe that's your arm strike is a kick a shell slam you know however you want to narrate it after that it's Gooch the third very hurt
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:22:01 Yes.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:22:18 and you have advantage on your attack he's stunned
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:22:21 Alright, so this guy's looking pretty hurt then, right? So I probably don't... Well, I probably don't want to use my sneak attack on him, because it would probably be wasted. So I'll let somebody else move in after. So, Jonathan, I guess I'll ask you this for practicality, because I don't know how you feel about this.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:22:23 Thank you.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:22:31 He's dead.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:22:37 Okay.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:22:48 Is there any world where I could run up that hill behind the goth summer Aladrin and hide? Oh, I can throw if I'm hidden, right? I can throw if I'm hidden, right? And still get sneak attack?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:22:58 I established it is 15 feet tall. The snake had to use all of its movement. So you would have to get there in, it's 20 feet to the cliff. You would need 30, what? Yeah, yeah.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:23:07 Thank you.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:23:19 Okay, well then I'm going to try to... I think I have 35 on my dagger, so that's plenty already just where I am. But I'll move around over here and hide behind Alabaster. And I'll stealth. I shouldn't be able to roll less than a 9, but even with that it's a 7 plus 11, or 18.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:23:34 Give me a stealth check. Yeah, you got it. 18. I think that beats passive on any character at this point, so go ahead and... Well, maybe not. We'll see. Passive is not that.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:23:48 But I should should only be able to roll a dirty 20. Right. I'm going to tuck behind and I'm going to see him up on the hill. I'm going to see a really juicy looking knee. I want to put a dagger in an aim.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:23:54 Thank you.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:24:04 you're good to make your attack with advantage. Okay. 27 hits.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:24:07 Thank you.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:24:16 Hmm.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:24:18 Right for the joint. I'll take this. Oh. 27. All right. So the dagger damage is only five. But the sneak attack damage is I'd like to take his leg off. Is going to be 16.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:24:37 Thank you.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:24:40 16 yeah that's a good damage um do you with that hit realize this foe is really not that weak uh the damage dealt to barrow in the one shot and then this doesn't like obliterate their knee right away you see it start bleeding a little bit kind of put pressure and stops and the dagger blinks back to you but um still looking very healthy
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:24:52 Okay.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:25:03 Alright, I'm gonna say, oh fuck, and I'm gonna use my bonus action to stab the leg of the wolf behind me and try to finish it off. I should have advantage. Right in the hind. Natural 20. Oh, minimum again, so 10.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:25:14 Yeah. Natural quality. Finish this wolf.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:25:15 Nice. This guy fucking loves legs. No. Jesus. Nice.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:25:25 Oh, yeah. It's just...
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:25:36 I just throw the dagger, and I'm thinking it's going to obliterate that guy. And I'm like, oh, okay. And I'll skimmy over to the wolf, and I'll just grab its leg like this. Well, it's big. And I'll just... Oh, I'm so sorry.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:25:50 jesus blood starts just spurting everywhere because you get covered your full face is like you hit like a major artery at one point and it's just spewing everywhere as you go through its leg it howls out in pain and falls down and it grabs you on your lapel and it kind of chuffs at you a
2-traceritops.ogg 01:25:53 Gyrate.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:25:53 Okay.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:26:16 It, like, puts a pawprint of blood on your face that drags down, and it dies in your arms, whether or not you wanted it there. And that ends your turn, unless you want to move. That was Bronn's action. Nice. Do that. Rock.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:26:31 I can't hide anymore because that was action. And bonus, so that's it. So. What?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:26:47 You start getting more bird-like with it. That would be gradual. It won't be instantaneous. Yeah. I don't see why not. I think...
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:26:53 I have, I've got 40 feet of movement speed. Can I fly up to exactly where that guy is and engage him? I mean, yeah, I understand what you're saying.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:27:17 If it's 15 feet high and you're 30 or so feet away, even like with the A squared plus B squared plus C squared, I think you're just right about there. So, you know, go for it. Nice.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:27:23 I'm 40. And I'll go ahead and I'll rage. I'll just be like, you don't want to make me angry. I don't like it.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:27:51 You're both so senior. I think you can click it on your character. You click on Wild Magic, I think it takes you to the menu. But if it's a D100 role, I'm pretty sure.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:27:51 It's just...
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:27:53 You're an angry bird. Yeah.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:27:54 uh yeah and then i forget i forget what the the roles are for the wild magic i have to look it up every time isn't it the dh on do you remember the list is that under futures and traits
2-traceritops.ogg 01:28:14 you
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:28:24 wild surge it is a d8 d8 yeah that one
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:28:29 Yours is a B8. Okay, you've got it pulled up so you can tell the party what happens.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:28:52 shadowy tendrils lash out around me each creature of your choice you can see within 30 feet must exceed in a constitution saving throw or take necrotic damage I'm just going to say the guy right in front of me yeah so he'll take a
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:29:10 Gets a natural three for a total of six. Six new products.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:29:14 Bye.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:29:30 That'll just be six necrotic damage. And then these will just be attacked to roll or to hit here. And I'll go ahead and just be reckless just to get advantage. Gotcha. Gotcha. 28 to hit. 15 plus three.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:29:42 Of course you will. Be reckless. You know, you've earned that. 28 definitely hits.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:30:00 just the additional rage or 12 plus 3 for 15 and then second hit oh with advantage again i guess i guess 17 does that hit i can do it i can do reckless both times right okay all right well here well here's the other half of that advantage 24 hit
2-traceritops.ogg 01:30:04 Thank you.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:30:08 So. Nice.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:30:12 Yes, it does. Oh, wait. Does not hit. This is the stronger guy. When you pick Reckless, you do it the full round, regardless of whether you want to or not. 24 hits. 11 more. Got it.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:30:31 And that'll be 11 more blasting damage.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:30:41 Okay, starting to show some wear, good hits. At the start of the round, unseen before, you see, rather you hear, there are exactly eight bodies in the field. One dead already. Somebody roll a d8.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:31:07 Don't like that.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:31:13 yeah he's got it all right hey
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:31:22 Torch's up. Eight.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:31:24 Or it's got it.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:31:25 And I say eight is good. You see the body of the wolf explodes when a spectral bullet collides with it. And you all see at the very top of like a little, like, you know, when you see those rock features in the middle of like the deserts and the Badlands is really tall, skinny rock. And there seems to be like another Fae figure at the top with a long spectral rifle and seems to have blown up the wolf.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:31:55 He's so far away.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:31:55 at initiative count 20. After that, it is barrel. If you can find a way to get an advantage on an attack, you can use that at 20.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:31:58 Hmm.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:32:08 My finger slammed a button. I didn't mean to roll that. OK, so the guy next to us is I'm going to sprint towards this corner.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:32:23 If you can get it to a point of advantage, you can get that in that coin. Okay.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:32:29 Thank you.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:32:33 Hit the wolf, he's stunned. What's the damage on
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:32:36 And as I'm about to cross the corner, I'm going to huck my axe of returning at this homie up here. So the axe is going as I cross the corner. So I disappear, and then I get stalked. Whether I... Sorry. Whether I hit or not. Oh, I got a net!
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:32:36 It's the point.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:33:01 Nine. Another nat 20. Wait. Wait, hold on. We have to admire what's happened here. Before, we're going to disregard this. You rolled two nat 20s that you were robbed of one of. I think with this axe of returning, you're doing double crit damage.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:33:05 That was the damage that I accidentally rolled. I accidentally rolled a damage roll. I'm going to keep that six. I slam him as I cruise around the corner. Okay. Holy shit.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:33:05 That was the damage roll. Roll.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:33:06 Oh my God. Nice.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:33:09 Nice.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:33:25 hell yeah
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:33:35 It's not a powerful weapon, so it's not a huge role, but... It'd be 46 plus 12. All right, 32 points of damage.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:33:42 Send it dude.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:33:44 Okay, so reroll the... It's usually 1d6 plus 3. What am I at? Okay, I'm not going to do a plus 12. This is the 4d6 coming in on. 32 damage as I cook up there. I get stuck right to the fucking axe as it hits me.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:33:47 you'll get 46 plus 12. yes okay that's red sniper sniper
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:34:03 Damn.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:34:10 Oh yeah.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:34:13 heavy hit and yeah you all see barrel it's not like he teleports his body gets like whiplash pulled directly to the handle his fat sort of uh aerodynamically shapes where he's kind of cone shaped as he's yanked forward and he makes not damaging but hard contact directly on this sort of aladrin
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:34:14 He's still up. Okay.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:34:36 Oh.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:34:39 Yes, he is. This is a parody of the group The Most Powerful Foe, by the way. You swivel around after hooking him with your axe beard. And you hit him with trickle. Dirty 20 hits.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:34:44 so my axe pulls to him and I get sucked up to him and I like the hook of my axe hooks around his neck as I damage him and I like swing around and try to stab him in the back with my other attack 30 20 okay another good one 10 more
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:35:12 Somebody needs to make a when pigs fly joke. You're just making that noise when you fly through the air. Whee!
2-traceritops.ogg 01:35:14 Spider-pig, spider-pig.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:35:15 Mm hmm.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:35:18 Wee! Wee! Okay, gosh, you're so good.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:35:21 Alrighty. After that, it's his turn. He turns and goes, fucking ow! His throat's kind of bleeding a little bit. He's like, you know what? Fuck you, man! And he's gonna take his attack on you now. Instead, he makes two attacks with his longsword. First one is a dirty 20 to hit.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:35:50 That hits. That misses. Fuck.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:35:51 Second one is a 12 to hit. It has 15 points of slashing damage and 9 points of fire damage.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:36:06 Damn. This edgy dude. There's definitely fire there. I felt it through you. I huck the ring at him. It just sinks into his fat pit.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:36:14 It's just pointing. Little ring. We just all smell bacon.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:36:21 Good call out. Yeah, it's not a tune that don't use it at all. Okay.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:36:21 It requires attunement. Alabaster, it's your go. Yes.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:36:36 Ooh, it's a 15-foot cliff here. I mean, I have 30 feet of distance, and it's 15 feet to get there, so you think I can make it?
2-traceritops.ogg 01:36:46 Dude, he's 15 feet tall. Just reach over.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:36:49 Yeah, I'd say it's not quite half speed for you. You can get up with like a third speed. I think if you used your ability again and you get the extra movement, I mean the extra reach from it, you'd be right within 10 feet. 15 feet up, 10 more feet up in there, you've got 5 feet of movement to get one square over. And then you've got, with your 10 foot range...
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:37:20 You could hit again. Five foot wouldn't do it, though.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:37:24 Alright, we're going all in. I'll lumber on up. You can just see me precariously climbing this cliff. I'm gonna get you! And I finally make it up there, put my hands on my knees, take a deep breath in, and I just sword goes slicing by without disregard for
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:37:51 Allies, I imagine they'll lunge out of the way, but it's coming in hot. Wouldn't that be an advantage because Barrows would provide flanking? Flanking?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:38:01 Let's see. Being 10 feet away, I don't know that you get advantage alone. But honestly, Jesse, how would you rule that? God, I feel like maybe.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:38:12 Thank you.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:38:25 I don't know. I feel like he's directly on the opposite side, so his reach is still there, and he's being harried from the opposite side. But I also want him to be able to hit, so I'm not being very impartial, being very unbiased.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:38:37 Yeah, is it them being hairy that gives you advantage, I guess? Or is it... Ah. Okay. I will take it.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:38:46 I'm going to say yes. It's you harrying them when somebody else harries them. I'm going to say you get advantage though. I'm saying like, okay, but here's this. You get advantage if you somehow fail by a significant margin, there's a chance you hit Carrick with your attack instead.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:38:56 supposed to be like you're getting it from
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:39:13 Yikes. Good thing I rolled 21. Does that hit? Awesome. All right. I'll take a D6 of damage. Nice. I'll only take one damage. Already better than last time. We'll see what this D20 comes out looking like.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:39:17 Yeah, hits, scary risk, not actually gonna happen to you. Roll high, let's do this damage. One point of damage.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:39:35 Here we go. Balls rolling uphill.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:39:36 Big roll. Big time. Big time. Bye. Bye.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:39:47 like really really low rolls tonight but i suppose a little better than 2d6 plus 4. yeah 13 damage all right so 13 on that hit i will i'll do a divine smite and um i'll do it at the third level so that will make it a uh that'd be 48 nice
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:39:47 You're rolling really average at the moment. Nine plus four, 13. Okay. 48.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:39:49 Yeah.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:40:16 Damn. There are only a few under the average, but if you take into account all of them, it's pretty substantial.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:40:23 Swinging heavy. And a three.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:40:25 God damn it. Two ones in there again. Oh yeah, there is an eight. Yeah. Yeah. And I can't.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:40:27 Hey, there's one eight in there. There's an eight in there, baby. Oh, man.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:40:27 okay this um this alleges showing some pretty serious where not on death's door by any means but from where they started in comparison to your own strength they're looking pretty defeated anything else on your turnout after
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:40:54 Can't hit him with a second strike because I'm out of range, right? But I can cast a spiritual weapon. Well, I have a second attack, right, for my just regular action. So I guess I could throw it, or would that be an object interaction? All right.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:41:01 yeah you could throw like in theory you could throw your sword or you could cast spiritual weapon yeah yours doesn't come back to you but you could walk over and pick it up if you wanted usually a fool
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:41:18 Yeah.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:41:24 Out of frustration, just pure anger and spite, I will just hurl my sword towards my foe. And this one should be a regular. Okay. 23 connects. So sword comes flying. Hey, look at that.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:41:35 Roll an attack with advantage. I like it. I like the chutzpah. 23 hit. 16. Mm-hmm.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:41:42 Thank you.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:41:52 16 damage. And fuck it, I'll do another Divine Spite. I'll just do it at the second level, so that would be 3d8, right? There it is. 22 damage. That was a huge hit.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:41:53 God damn.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:42:11 Wow. Seriously, they are barely hanging on. Your first strike, like, they're just far enough away that when the, like, basically claim or cloudbuster sword comes down, you, like, cut into their chest a little bit, but, like, not deep just because of the distance. You take the damage when you force the sword to swing back around and then you huck it at them and the sword, like, embeds in their chest and they're, like,
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:42:40 gasping for air, collapsed lung, six broken ribs, like instantly down onto one knee from the power of the strike. Not long for death for sure. After that...
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:42:51 Yeah, and I'll yell out, My memory's a tombstone. Your name's already on it. Because everyone's going to have a good catchphrase.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:42:58 Thank you.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:43:03 Nice.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:43:04 fire snake screams out. He's like, Tom! No! And he slithers his movement there and then he goes to there and he pulls out his gun and he shoots at you, alabaster. Straight roll. He gets over there with 25 to...
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:43:21 This motherfucker. Jesus Christ. Yeah, that'll it. Fuck. This guy with his fucking gun.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:43:28 Hey, he may be a big target, but shoot at something your own size.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:43:32 It's just the same bonus everybody gets. You take 12 points of piercing damage. You're up, man.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:43:33 Thanks got good aim. Jesus Christ.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:43:46 Powerful.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:43:57 Or maybe with scales like you. And I'm going to roll at him. Get up on him. I have 45 feet. I'm a fast turtle. I roll. Here we go. Just going to swing with my claws. Nat 20. Double damage, correct?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:44:05 What's your movement? Oh, easy. Nice. Yes, sir. Roll both attacks. Maybe you crit again. You can just roll all your damage dice and be glorious.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:44:16 God damn. Nice. Should take his gun.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:44:22 Yes.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:44:23 Hell yeah.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:44:30 Good idea. Oh, the complete opposite of the spectrum. The added damage does double as well, right? So 12. Okay. Okay. Two twos. 16.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:44:36 Oh! You hit both ends, man. Okay, go ahead and roll your crit damage, though. Yes. 16...
2-traceritops.ogg 01:45:02 And might as well make a stun and strike. So call and save and throw. 314. Oh, he saves. Nice. All right. Fuck you right back, dude.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:45:10 What does the fire snake's talent say? Plus zero. That's 15? Hell yeah. Blood comes out of his mouth and he goes, fuck you. Yeah. Yeah.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:45:28 Hey, Jonathan. How does lucky work in this? Can I have you re-roll that? Or is it not just... I don't know how you want to handle it. Because it's different than it used to be. It used to be like, you know, you can change a roll.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:45:42 read it you can take the old one though oh I don't care about luck it's fine it was made to be the way it was so but if you read it if you have the lucky feet
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:45:45 What's it say now? All right.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:45:55 I know, I know. But I mean, like, I don't I don't know which way you want to play it because it. Internet died for some reason.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:46:11 Is it somebody you're engaged with and you do it to anybody or is it just when I make a roll? I'm pretty sure it's somebody you're in combat with making an attack on you. Did you hear me? Yeah.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:46:16 Thank you.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:46:20 Thanks.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:46:26 No, my internet died like right immediately after I asked the question. Oh, okay. Gotcha. All right. Never mind then.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:46:36 Gotcha, gotcha. I'm pretty sure Lucky, even with the old version, because I don't care about it, Lucky's fine regardless. It was made to be the way it is. I'm pretty sure if you use it on me, it has to be me attacking your character. I don't think it's all powerful and that you can make me just reroll. I think it's got to be the attack on you. Because I think if you pull it off, you can see that.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:46:38 I'm currently flurry of blowing.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:46:51 Okay.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:46:58 It works, I'm good.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:47:08 Okay. 24 hits, 14 does not. 10. Finish this snake. And that was the third attack. Yeah, just you cut him into like
2-traceritops.ogg 01:47:08 14 and a 24. 10 damage. I told you to hit someone your own size, but do it in the afterlife, bitch, and I sliced straight through him and just cut him in half. But I guess it's like three segments.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:47:25 you you
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:47:38 third, so just like falls apart in pieces. Nice hit. Gooch, you were up.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:47:41 One really skinny middle section.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:47:50 right so I don't think I can get to far guy even if I throw see well I can't get my map to load because my internet's bad right now so I'm just gonna attack the
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:48:15 I can tell you. He is bare minimum like 75 horizontal or whatever. So add 15 for the first hill is 90. And the second clip he is on is really tall. So he's like baseline 150 feet away.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:48:19 You're like 25 feet.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:48:35 well I can't do anything then with him so I will just hide and then attack the summer aladrin once my sheet reloads but I'll make my way towards the other guy so I'll do a stealth check with disadvantage still
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:49:05 I don't think I can roll less than a. OK, so 15 to 26. Alright, well. So yeah, I'll throw a dagger right at his other leg. Alright, so that'll be. Another one.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:49:08 You got 26. Yeah, absolutely succeeds. And also, you're right on the cliff edge, but you can get to him. 21 to hit. Hits. Oh, five.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:49:10 Oh.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:49:36 And then sneak attack damage. All five does it. Damn it. OK. All right, well, he takes another. 24 damage.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:49:39 does it, but go ahead and add direct for damage. Five does it. He had four HP. That was a huge hit from Leopold at the end there. You obliterate it. How does, I mean, how do you, with your knee fetish, finish this Goffy Summer Elijah?
2-traceritops.ogg 01:49:58 Okay.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:50:02 Earlier, I threw the dagger and it hit his leg and it blinked back and it didn't cut it all the way. So I'll go up there and I'll stab him in the other leg. And then I'll come back and I'll finish the other leg that I didn't get before.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:50:17 You sever both his femoral arteries. He just starts burning blood all over the place. You kind of bask in it in a really sick way. And then, yeah, I mean, dead. Super dead. You guys just have the last guy. Unless you do anything else to your turn. Carrick, it'll be you and then guy at the top.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:50:35 for that.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:50:43 I want to crawl into Tortimus' shell real quick and then my turn.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:50:43 What's and our rough distance is 150 feet. You set it up to this guy probably. Okay, so I'll use my I'll use my movement. My action to dash, but I'll just fly 80 feet. For like halfway.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:50:47 You already had... 150 feet as far as you guys can discern. He's way out there. Very nice.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:51:23 At the top of the round, it'll be his round. Somebody roll a D6. Goofs to thirds is getting there first. Five. Five at the very back. It goes front to back. Alabaster. He is going to try to hit you.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:51:35 Like I told the last guy fucking shoot me.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:51:42 Me, isn't it?
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:51:53 guy fucking again I know man Jesus fucking Christ I want to put my shield up to try to try to hide myself behind it but rolling hot tonight
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:51:58 He's got the sniper rounds. He's like, yeah, AC-20, eat it. Ow.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:52:01 That's a natural 20. I'm really terribly sorry for this. You take 66 points of damage.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:52:16 Peace, peace, peace, peace.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:52:20 Thank you.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:52:24 8d10? What the fuck? Do you have a sniper? Jesus.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:52:26 Uh, all right. Just go down immediately. What did he do? What was that? Oh God. Jesus Christ. Fucking has an elephant gun. I had 53. Yeah.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:52:27 Woo! Woo-woo! Wow. Sniper round. Crit hit. Headshot. Called a headshot. No.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:52:32 As his 4d10 plus 9 turns to 8d10 plus 18. He's got a Spectral Sniper. That doesn't outright kill you though, right? That just takes you down? Yeah, you've got more than 80 negative. You are... You just... It's like your body doesn't...
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:52:55 Yeah. Launderbuss right there, man.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:52:58 Quite literally.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:53:01 The shell goes through your chest, and the SoundCloud it creates scatters all the dust, but your body stays there for a second, and then you just drop back at a lower rate, slam into the ground. After his turn, that is Barrow.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:53:07 Oh man.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:53:18 Do we have any healers? Does anybody have any form of heal? Oh, no. Yeah.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:53:23 Yeah, I do, but I'm fucking dead.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:53:29 Anybody can make a medicine check. One sniper. There's one guy on you. Right here.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:53:29 Motions? Just to stabilize him. The first three are down. One to go, I think. One known. He's way over...
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:53:33 Okay, so these three guys are dead that we're fighting, correct? And we've got one or two people there. Over here.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:53:52 Dude, use your bow skills. Use your bow skills. Pick up the dude's bow right next to you.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:53:57 at the top of like a large rock feature that's super tall.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:54:05 Okay. I literally don't have a bow. I might be a ranger, but I do not have a bow. No, yeah. I did in my starting equipment, I guess, with a longbow, but like...
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:54:15 It's the funniest ranger I've ever seen.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:54:15 You guys would have basic starting items. So if you took basic equipment, I think that gives you short bow arrows, you know, you have bare minimum have leather armor, things like that. Did you not pick a bow at all?
2-traceritops.ogg 01:54:22 Thank you.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:54:35 Am I really gonna fucking kill this guy? Um... I'm gonna rush over to Tortimus and try to do a medicine check on him. Make sure I don't have any spells. I thought... Yes. Excuse me. Yeah, I don't have any spells. Okay. Yeah, I'll try to do...
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:54:50 Alabaster. Torque's doing great. It's new characters, you know. Give them a break. Okay. The DC-10 to stabilize.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:54:51 Being an alabaster. Come on, use those magical medicine hooves.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:54:54 No.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:55:06 A medicine check on it. That counts as a death thing?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:55:24 Rex, go ahead and mark one death save. One death save failure.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:55:29 Oh.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:55:31 Oh, do I not get to try to... Yikes. Fucking Alabaster is out. This guy's going to die. I might need one, you know.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:55:34 That's intense, yeah. It goes either way. Bring him up or hurt him. Did you have a second character made ready? A second second character made ready to go?
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:55:39 I'm doing fucking secret button.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:55:44 Dude, what did you even learn at your fucking ranger school?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:55:55 I don't think so. Okay, and then this is something that I saw online that I really want to implement. Rex, it is your turn. Alabaster, make a death save, but I don't want you to roll it openly. I want you to roll it, and you can just message me what it is. It'll be between me and you. The party will not know what you rolled.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:56:16 IRL.com.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:56:16 Oh, okay. Can I roll? I think I can roll it just to you. It's a D. I just rolled a D20, right? So that went to you. Yep.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:56:22 And this is going to be how I do it going forward because I think it puts way more pressure on it. You don't know if they're safe or not. Yeah, you can change at the top of your game log. It says... Like when he rolled it, did everybody see it?
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:56:27 Because now we don't know the outcomes yet. Negative.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:56:45 I don't think so, because it says just to DM. Nice. I just rolled it to you. Cool. Yeah, it's convenient.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:56:47 Or, yeah, the real guy is right next to you. Nope.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:56:47 Rex, I see it, but does anybody see that he rolled anything? Perfect. Okay, so it works. If you rolled the stealth, I still see it. Okay. Good to know, Rex. Tort, you're up. It worked. I saw it. I like that it works that way.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:56:50 No.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:57:08 you
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:57:22 Change the tone a bit. No, but it's towards tone and you are dying.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:57:33 Are you out of combat? Where's the last guy? Jesus, soon. That guy fucking killed me so far away.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:57:39 Oh, sure. Way up yonder. Um.
6-bfschmity.ogg 01:57:40 Did we not have any sort of potions as like a primary resource being these protectors of the wild? Guardians. You got nothing. That's an AoE.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:57:58 Okay, so you're climbing the rock face that he's on.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 01:58:09 Sorry. I was messing with buttons.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:58:11 I feel like I got to just try and get to this guy. I have, okay, with the dash, I would have 90 feet of movement. Would that, and also with that, I don't know exactly how you would rule this, but one of my, I have acrobatic movement.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:58:38 So when I'm not having armor or shield, I can move along vertical surfaces. It says, like, without falling during the movement. But with that, like... Right. I'm just horizontal on one.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:58:47 Yeah, that's why I love monks. Yeah, so that is, if he is 150 feet away, 90 feet is well more than halfway. So you are like, if he's up here, you're like on the rock below him climbing up. And you, everybody saw, you like Sonic the Hedgehog spun that fast. Like, it was crazy. Gooch, you're up.
2-traceritops.ogg 01:59:09 I'm a spin like a green shell and Mario cart and just fucking send it Adam. So what that would be, but that put me like right under him. Cool. Oh, nevermind. Um,
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 01:59:14 Boogie.
4-jessev567890.ogg 01:59:18 Trying to decide. My medicine is really bad.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:59:25 Yeah, you'd get there next turn, regular movement. Yes. Yes, my child. Your movement is what? 40?
2-traceritops.ogg 01:59:40 Okay, I have a thing that lets me do a dash as a bonus action. Would I get to 45? So I'm still not tuned. Okay.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 01:59:54 45. So 45 dash is 90. Bonus action dash is 135. You're still not doing it, but you're much closer. You are right below the little left.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:00:02 1.35.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:00:05 Not bad.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:00:11 We're just going to . Well, that's the acrobatic movement, too. I don't fall. OK.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:00:12 And I'll say, I'm not going to even, as a turtle with magic Wolverine claws, you're not going to make like an athletics check to stay there in between movements. Like you run up the wall that fast and then bed yourself at the top, sort of waiting. Yeah. But like in between turns, technically you fall 60 feet around, but we're not going to do that because that's unnecessary with your character.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:00:41 And I'm just trying to figure out. I don't think there's anything I can do. I mean, my medicine so bad I could use lucky. Just try to roll good. Get a minus one. Get a minus one. That's a disadvantage still.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:00:42 Sir Gooch III. You could. DC 10.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:00:44 Go ahead, Sir Gooch. Just try to heal his knees. You're really good at messing up knees. Maybe you're good at it, dude.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:00:59 That's hardly a disadvantage. Yeah. Is that enough?
2-traceritops.ogg 02:01:14 Good at healing them too.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:01:15 Just piece them back together. Yeah. OK. So I'll run over to Alabaster, because I am a teacher's pet. All right.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:01:15 He's just a fucking orthopedic surgeon. Really knows his knees.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:01:19 So disadvantage minus one, you have lucky. So it's basically you can predetermine it and roll just straight or you can roll it after. But before obviously, you know, the result before I reveal it to you. So you could roll it and then roll again. One of them again.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:01:44 Hello. Run over here. And I pull out of my pocket a bunch of Achilles tendon bits. And I try to wrap suture. Sound like some sort of. All right. Ah, this is stressful.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:01:56 That's haunting. You throw some simple interrupted stitches with other people's Achilles tendons. Give me that medicine pick.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:02:00 You've kept your rewards. Can we say the sniper shot his neven? No!
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:02:06 Oh God. Jesus Christ.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:02:19 Okay, so that's obvious. So that's the without luck. I haven't used luck yet. So I'll use the luck now. Okay.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:02:24 That's incredible. That's incredible. Yep. Go again. Reroll. They never taught us this in training.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:02:32 It looks like Alabaster isn't going to make it. He looks like he's really close to dying. He's going into instant septic shock. Just roll one more dice.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:02:32 Okay. As soon as you touched him, he got worse. Dude, he's even more gray than usual. No.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:02:38 They're just stuffing tendons into an open wound.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:02:49 Now, is lucky, would this be straight medicine, or would it still be again with a disadvantage? Okay. So here we go.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:03:00 Come on, Nat20, come on! Oh, that's good. It at least takes away the fucking Nat1. That takes two. Oh my god. Gooch, dude, you're not a healer.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:03:05 Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:03:05 Nine. Rex, mark your second death say fail. Carrie, it's your turn, man.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:03:11 Jesus Christ. Fuck.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:03:17 go with, uh,
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:03:24 My muscle memory kicks in and you see me just cutting his leg. What'd I do? Oh, fuck, Rex. I'm sorry.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:03:30 You made it worse. No! We were just sitting in a hole for a real long time, dude.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:03:40 You blacked out for a second. You guys see that Gooch is trying to take his Achilles tendon and he's like, uh, okay.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:03:41 Oh.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:03:47 Do we really have no potions? We're like the guardians of the fucking Feywild. We don't have anything. Oh, God.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:03:52 No, we don't have anything. You were yelling at us training for like months waiting for the shit. We burned all our shit. We drank everything day one. Been sober sallies for like a long time.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:04:06 We're blaming it on you. Oh, fuck. Oh. Jonathan, could I try pulling a card and see if I get something good that'll help? Okay. I gotta try something.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:04:13 I thought the potions were more fireball, dude. I drank them so quick. Oh, fuck. This is the time where Gooch disappears from his business.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:04:18 Yeah. Yeah. Object interaction. You pulled card. 13.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:04:22 Oh my god. D113. Oh my god. This cannot be good.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:04:28 Gooch is just fucking out of here now too.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:04:36 13. This is like. No.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:04:44 All teammates are revived. I... No! Fuck. Dude, he... Wait, maybe he just hid. He disappears all the time. Check my shell. Check my shell.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:04:47 What's his name? That's awesome. Yeah, typical. Typical. Yeah. Run it away. You're like
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:04:47 Everybody, you watch Gooch Disappears. Gooch Disappears. Jesse, I'm going to text you.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:04:51 Oh, no. Fuck, fuck, fuck, dude. This is so fucked. Oh, my God. I'm fucking peering in. Peering into the shell. All I see is fireball, dude. I don't see shit.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:04:59 Jesus Christ.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:05:13 Oh no. This is what I get for trying to help.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:05:22 Fuck. Gooch. It looks like I'm calling out to my own Gooch because my head's in my shell.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:05:26 I guess I'm not close to you, but for flavor. My gooch, dude. Not having his camera on for this is tough. We don't see the fucking facial cues.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:05:31 Yeah.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:05:46 Somehow I don't think it's, I turn invisible and get five healing potions. Yeah. Yeah, you get a wish spell. Did an outfit change? Did you put a hoodie on for that? Oh, okay. Okay.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:05:52 You've met the god of your choice. You're transported. You get to ask for six wish belts.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:05:56 You're dead, puts on the hoodie.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:06:00 The...
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:06:04 Okay. I sent you a text about what happened to you, but nobody else can see you. No, I had my hoodie on.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:06:17 I haven't got your text yet. Yeah. Oh, I have my Wi-Fi off. OK. I'll be quiet. My turn's over. I'm probably dead.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:06:31 Fucking hell.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:06:32 I just used my movement to get over to him. And then I bonus action raged again because I didn't take any damage on that last turn off the line. And I got a one again, which means they have to make a constitution saving throw.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:06:41 Okay. That is seven, they can't say fails.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:06:52 That is by the book Barbarian, and I respect it.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:07:00 That's great. That's still a miss. So they're going to take a D12 of necrotic damage. It's a bummer.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:07:13 Oh. Oh.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:07:19 Guardians of the Wild TPK. Oh dear, stuck in Feywild forever. You're attacked, sir. Okay. At the start of the round...
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:07:25 Maybe.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:07:33 I had to use my bonus. I had to use my action and movement just to get to the top of that cliff still. No action. And bonus. Yep.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:07:47 Shoot me, dude! What's that symbolizing, Trev?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:07:50 There are three people in the field. Somebody roll a D4 minus one. One, it'll be Carrick.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:08:07 Yeah, Jonathan, you just put me out of my misery.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:08:07 That feels not good.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:08:11 No, it'll be Carrick. Front to back each time. He's going to try to shoot you. You're in combat with him, so he's got disadvantage with the ranged weapon. I'll add the modifier app just because I can't do... This is just a placeholder.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:08:19 Yeah, disadvantage, we'll take it. Misses.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:08:23 Nice.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:08:31 Oh fuck. Let's go.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:08:40 That is, with disadvantage, 16 to hit. Okay. Barrow, it is your turn. You kill him or he kills himself, right?
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:08:51 Fuck. I don't want to kill Alabaster, right? I want to leave the state. I want to leave the state. Yeah. I have
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:09:02 Well, it's either that or I roll a check and you just let me die.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:09:04 it's but so but he's right he and the death roll is a straight up roll
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:09:10 There is your turn or his turn.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:09:13 Well, here's this. If you pick him up, he can use a heel. That is correct.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:09:18 metagaming wise I have disadvantage on picking him up and not a good modifier right so like technically speaking the odds are better if I don't try right so if I don't
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:09:37 Yeah. So the gameplay itself is you're going to let him die.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:09:40 Is it DC 10?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:09:41 How about this? Second compromise in case it changes your decision. If Barrow takes a second point of exhaustion, you can make this check normal. You're going, you know, ultra. So you both roll flat.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:10:02 Okay. Are we? Are we at two known fail, though?
2-traceritops.ogg 02:10:06 No.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:10:13 If it changes, you can still do the same rule. Yes. Stable versus just one success. One more success. Two fails, one success. You figured out through process of elimination.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:10:14 But yeah, if you passed, then I would be stable, right? Mm-hmm. I'd have... Yep.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:10:25 And you got to do it right. Because even if he gets...
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:10:37 Okay. I do have a plus two, so it makes sense to do it. It just hurts. Okay. I'm going to try again. And I try the fucking computer. Fucking come on.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:10:38 Alabaster's your old cob. This is your nat 20. That's way better than a minus one. Come on. Fuck. He's getting so tired. Please!
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:10:45 Oh, makes sense. You got it. You got it. Close catapult. All right. All right. All right. Good enough. He's up. He's up. Woo. Woo.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:10:51 You gotta roll it. You gotta roll an eight or higher here. I'm dying. Oh! Jesus Christ. This is so close. Okay.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:10:56 You got it.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:11:06 let's go chest compress bleeding out of achilles a secondary bleeding out of his heart also but mostly the achilles you're really pumping eventually you see test balls come to him his his whole body goes up and down like the dinosaur from jurassic park one that was next to the giant pile of shit um
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:11:08 Yeah.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:11:15 The triceratops.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:11:17 Yeah, we'll be taking our long rest later.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:11:29 Thank you.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:11:34 He's unconscious for, it is going to be 1d4 hours per classic unconscious rules. You are unconscious for two hours. But you are alive. You are at one hit point. Torque Norella.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:11:51 Alright. Clutch. Arrow.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:11:56 I liked that it was a computer and not an actual dice. That felt like it wasn't on me anymore.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:11:58 Okay. Well, that was nice. Oh, that was scary. I would have hated to roll that. Good job, Trav. All right. All right.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:12:06 I just need it. Come on.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:12:10 That was rough job. Yeah. Advantage.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:12:22 He was a hero. A true hero.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:12:22 Ha ha ha!
2-traceritops.ogg 02:12:25 It's time to finish this. You hurt my fucking friend. And I'm gonna climb up and start swinging at him. These claws are for you. 20 to hit. Okay, well that was advantage on that person. I'm just gonna roll two for each. Oh, nat 20.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:12:39 20 hits, which you do have advantage. First hit's a 20. Nat 20, let's go. That's why we do it. Hit and a crit. Same as the other guy. This guy does look pretty hardy. Not as strong as the other legend, but stronger than everything else he fought.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:12:57 Oh my god. Not bad.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:12:57 Stunning strike as well, bitch. Oh, he didn't roll amazing, but 28 damage.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:13:10 So you know you've got to do some damage. 28. Still up but hurt. And Stunning Strike is a con save.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:13:32 Okay, bonus action. I'm fucking 40 blows in again. So do I get... I have advantage on these now, right? Okay. Okay, 17 on that one.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:13:37 That is a nine. Six plus three. Dunned. Let's go. Advantage, two more attacks. Seventeen.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:13:41 Let's go. Let's go.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:14:04 Nice. Oh, wow. Okay. Nice. 11 damage. Is this fucker still alive? Fuck.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:14:08 19. 13 misses, 19 hits. 11 more damage. Okay. 28, 11, 39. Still alive. Still alive, but hurt enough that for free...
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:14:36 You probably could kill him with a fall of this height, and he is stunned, so he could not fight back. Maybe he survives. He's going to fall 1d6 damage for every 10 feet he falls after the first 10 feet, so he's going to take 14d6 falling damage. 142.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:14:55 Okay. Why is he falling? Sure. Yeah. Oh, okay. Gotcha.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:14:58 What? Is that happening, man?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:15:05 He could fall to his death. I mean, you guys could too, in theory. That was always a possibility. So you couldn't push him because your turn is done, but Carrick is after you, and he could probably just push him over. That is an option. But before that, it is... Jesse, we're going to transition to you. Nobody else knows this, but you wake up
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:15:29 All right.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:15:33 All right.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:15:35 And you are in a smoky, ash-covered room. There is a distant forge being worked passively by a billow that just kind of goes up and down and pumps into it, constantly being stoked. It's mostly dark gray stone in this space. Not a whole lot of natural light in this room. But you seem to be in some sort of
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:16:04 foreign space you've never seen before. Nothing else.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:16:10 Hello? Look around. Guys? Alright. Oh, shit.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:16:14 try to stab the wall's knee
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:16:26 Cool.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:16:41 Yeah, that's pretty rough. Pretty much. That bad juju. I don't think I can.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:16:46 I mean, just what a card to pull. Basically. Would you like to do anything on your turn? You could start pulling more cards, you know.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:16:52 It's actually the prison gym, isn't it? We just had to say it. Yes.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:17:15 Oh my God.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:17:15 I'm going to pull five more cards. All right. Yeah, I pull five cards.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:17:16 It's only going to get better.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:17:17 I mean, as it stands, the party is 11 levels away from getting you out by any means. Right? You can't be located by any divination magic. Only a wish can reveal your location. So you either...
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:17:25 Oh, God. Oh, wait, wait. Don't you have some ability to
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:17:36 Make a new character, or you... I mean, if you want to work it with this character, I have an idea. I already put you in a spot that has a workaround, maybe. Do you want to continue with this character? Do you want to see where these cards take you? Okay. First card, D100 roll. Gooch III might be leaving with R8.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:17:51 I want to see what the cards do and then go from there. I thought. Yeah.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:17:53 Oh, my God. How far away is the teleport? The force is just going to show up. 96. What is it?
2-traceritops.ogg 02:17:55 Might as well. Oh. My favorite Jesse character.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:18:07 That feels good.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:18:09 Don't you have the ability to know any question? Like one question that help you?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:18:14 He does. You pull a card that has a regal, magnificent-looking chair on it. You gain proficiency and expertise in your choice of history, insight, intimidation, or persuasion.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:18:31 In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently home to one or more monsters, which must be cleared out before you can claim it as your own. This is the Throne Cart.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:18:43 That's a sweet card. Yes, 93. You've been a high.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:18:46 Okay, I'll take intimidation and I'll keep pulling cards. Second throne. Okay. Don't give me that look.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:18:51 you you
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:19:00 93. This is going to go one down, not one up. Just because that was the same span as the card you just pulled. Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession vanish instead. Yes.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:19:25 Don't the cards keep pulling, though, for the five I pulled? Isn't that one of the things that happens? Yeah. Well, I still get the other three, right? Because they automatically... All right. Okay.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:19:31 Oh, fuck. It just deletes the rest? Well, I guess good thing you didn't have one of the O'Dears, right?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:19:31 But you lose all of your possessions again. Yeah, I'm ready. I'm just on the other screen. Let me know the number.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:19:34 And you're just stuck.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:19:37 You lost the rest of the deck. You got no shit, man.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:19:56 37. That's like first thing I rolled was 37. Okay. This is going good. That you're.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:20:02 No, the other one you rolled was... Hold on. It was 60-something. Or 70-something, like 72. Because you got the Sage card. This one is 37...
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:20:20 You pull a card that has a wicked-looking clown on it. You pulled the Jester card. You have advantage on d20 rolls for the next 72 hours, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws. Take the two. You're a fucking mess. Okay, we're going to come back to you in a second. Karen, it's your turn.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:20:28 Take the two. All right. I thought your rolls were bad, Rex.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:20:39 Wait. Wait.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:20:46 You have, that was two polls. You have five more. Do I make a check and forget?
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:20:47 I've got the Shieldmaster feat, so I'm just going to shove him with my shield, just blast him, fly him right off the cliff. Yeah, but you're also stunned, right? So, I mean, there's really no fighting back.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:20:53 Keep drawing them, baby. Yeah. Good shot. Block this guy.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:21:07 I'm going to go on my hands and knees. Table-topping dude. Table-topping dude. Damn. That was pretty healthy.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:21:10 Yes.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:21:17 You tabletop him. He tumbles. Go ahead and roll me 14d6 damage. He has 49 hit points remaining. In theory, you can miss it. Oh! Hits the ground. Broken legs. Broken arm. Can't move.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:21:17 yeah rolled it rolled it real soft
2-traceritops.ogg 02:21:36 I thought I got him way closer to death's door. Damn.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:21:42 jump on him. And on your raging.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:21:47 bottom of the cliff still alive with 10 hit points. 150 feet down. It's flight and then you fall 60 feet per round. So you have your movement plus 60.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:21:52 How many feet is that? How many feet is that flying straight down to the cliff? Yeah. That's... No way, man. I can't survive that fall. I wouldn't even get there in a round. Oh, so I could... Oh, I see. Yeah, okay. So I could almost close that. Oh, no, I can. That's 140 feet. You said it was 150?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:22:24 Well, it's 150 total. He fell 140 feet worth of damage because the first 10 feet doesn't count for some reason. That's just the rules. Okay. I'll let you just describe how you finish him. I will need an acrobatics check or a constitution saving throw.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:22:26 Oh, then that's great. That's fine. I'll do that. I'll fly 80 feet and drop the last 60.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:22:33 You got it.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:22:50 to see if you can survive this fall without also taking, you would just take 5d10 because it'd be 50 feet worth of damage. Yeah, I agree.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:23:01 Okay, well, I guess I'd rather do the saving throw rather than the check because the save throws on the ability check. It's just...
2-traceritops.ogg 02:23:11 To Eric Cocker's not have any like slow fall. Okay.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:23:15 He went full diving speed flight and then free fall falling distance and he's slamming into this character to do the damage because that's movement. So this is can he avoid killing himself? 20 on the roll. Dirty 20. You avoid most of the damage. We'll do like 3d10. Sorry, 3d6 damage. And I'll move that for you.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:23:41 uh yeah i'm just gonna like i'm essentially gonna like do that dive so i fly right off the cliff tuck keep going as fast as i can and i essentially just as soon as i have to start falling i put the shield underneath my like my feet or my knees just land on them just just kneeling on the shield just like pile drive them into the ground
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:23:44 7 points of damage. Superhero land on it.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:23:59 Okay.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:24:06 Nice.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:24:09 Just like a loud thud that kind of echoes through everything. Everything falls silent after that. The dust settles and his body is like exploded from the inside. And his form is like Plato stretched around you. So like the outside of his body is still intact. Where your shield is in the ground is exposed underneath. And you have finished this final Aladrin.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:24:39 Bye.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:24:43 I'm just sleeping under Alabaster's trunk. I was so stressed. I'm so tired.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:24:47 Alright.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:24:58 A moment passes. No further threats. Back to Gooch the third. Same thing. Keep drawing some cards. You're either going to get something that lets you get out or you're going to die. It's really nothing in between. Stop rolling in the same spot.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:25:05 he's not making it back I love the way this is going 91 you've been all over that spot
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:25:18 Hmph.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:25:19 Anyone.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:25:24 You rolled that one before, so I'm going to drop down to the next bracket. This is technically 83 through 87. You pull a card with a blazing sun over it. A magic item chosen by me appears on your person. In addition, you gain 10 temporary hit points daily at dawn until you die.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:25:48 Indefinitely? Oh, those are only temporary names.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:25:49 Damn.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:25:50 Give me that tuning fork. It gets me out of this. I think I have. Oh, no. Or more. All right. Well, if I don't die in the next four polls, I'll bust through these real quick.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:25:51 Dude, if you make it back to us, you make it back. What do you get, like crits and advantages and 10 hit points now?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:26:02 I'm going to need to continue your card pulls, and if you make it out not dying, I will give you a wish scroll to get out. Okay, same range, so I've got to drop down another group.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:26:02 Yeah, if you make it out, you're going to be buffed.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:26:20 Get the Charizard, dude. Oh, Jesus. That's fucked. I'm really not...
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:26:23 92, they'll love this. Go down again.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:26:24 Yeah. Yeah, that's fair.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:26:30 Because dropping up, just full disclosure, if you go up the next round, that's the void one. So you're just, that's insta-kill. So we're going to avoid the next tier. So 92 is going to take it to, we just did sun. You pull the star. Increase one of your ability scores by two to a maximum of 24.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:26:47 Bye.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:26:49 We're going to 100, isn't it? Nice.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:26:56 You start writing some of this stuff down. Hang on. All right. I'll write. Okay. All right. I've been too stressed to be writing this shit down. 48. Uh-oh.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:26:56 What? What?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:27:02 That's it. Next card. Craig's got us on this one. He'll document all your card points. I think this is what I would consider a success. 48. You pulled the knight card. You get your own Balinor, I'm pretty sure.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:27:24 yeah that's exactly it
2-traceritops.ogg 02:27:27 You do. The fifth. Gooch the fifth.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:27:27 What do you want to do?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:27:29 You gain the service of a knight who magically appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the same alignment as you and serves your loyalty until death. You believe the two of you have been drawn together by fate. You work with me to create a name and backstory of this NPC, or I can change it if I want. So off the top of your head, do you have anything? Because instantly I had what I wanted to do.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:27:56 Gooch the fourth will pull up here directly next to you. Gooch the fourth pops up right next to you. He doesn't have the backpack. He looks around and goes, oh, fuck. Pull your next card. Items. He drops in. The world shakes a little bit.
3-travisaurus6985.ogg 02:27:59 That's unbelievable.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:27:59 Yes! This is a mirror, bitch.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:28:01 Thank you.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:28:03 Alright, yeah, we'll just work on our parental dynamic. I'm just like, nope. Nope. Nope. I'll deal with you later. 38 again. I had a 37 before.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:28:29 Last time was 48. 38 might be different. Rain. Oh, yeah. So that goes to the next. So do you want to go up or down? I can't tell you. How many cards do you have after this? Two more? One more.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:28:34 Yeah.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:28:38 What do you guys think? All right. One. We're going up.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:28:41 Roll a d20. If it's lower than 10, go down. If it's greater, go up.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:28:52 Yeah that's fair. Going up. Let's go!
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:29:08 You gain the ability to cast Wish 1d3 times. Roll me a d4-1. You can cast Wish 3 times. A magic item that appears on your body is your blinkback dagger. And your magic leather armor.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:29:15 No way. It's awesome. Get the fuck out of here. Three times? So opied.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:29:22 You've collected so much shit. That's insane. And he has to...
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:29:33 All right, I still got. I was going to say, yeah, that there still could be something really bad. Come on. Oh. Come on.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:29:37 Gooch's wrinkly leather appears on your body and you have the ability to leave if you would like, but you have one more card pull. I believe. Oh, he does. Well, Oh, you're already. Oh, so you already pulled this one up or down.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:29:51 He has to do it too. I'm so stressed out. You go back into a different prison, Jim.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:30:07 This is awful.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:30:09 The card Medusa-like Vistage curses you. You take a minus two penalty to saving throws while cursed in this way, and only a god or the magic of the fates card can end this curse.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:30:11 Thank you.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:30:37 Some outrageous, some outrageous thoughts.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:30:39 It's a minus two to saving throws and what? Oh, that's it? That's not bad. All right. I'll just... I will... I will... I'll look around and be like, well...
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:30:42 saving throw. That's it. You missed the combat and then you just got to come back. Okay.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:30:46 mean you got a bunch of buffs and really one debuff so this somehow worked out as best as it really could actually like for sure with your son as your warrior
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:30:54 And you have three wishes.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:31:09 guess we should get going. And I'll say, I wish I was back with my friends. And then I'll...
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:31:12 it's been like 15 minutes in the real world you guys have like looted the bodies you're mourning the loss of Gooch who is not present and then he just teleports in and next to him is Gooch the fourth Gooch you
2-traceritops.ogg 02:31:18 With your son.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:31:37 What, man? You leave and you come back with your son? What happened? No, he's taking taxes.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:31:43 You know that you technically are a landowner at this point. You have property.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:31:48 Dude, he's got a mortgage now. And you have a dependent.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:31:52 Yeah. I'm in a higher... I'm in a higher tax bracket, so... You know... I, uh... Gooch the Fourth says something, and I say, Shut up! And I use my new expertise in intimidation. And I just seem really scary.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:32:11 just like really nasty grizzled beef bug eye eyes don't make him go full chihuahua mode
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:32:20 He gives like Chihuahua energy. Okay.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:32:20 All two feet of him is real scary.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:32:35 I'm just kidding. That was pretty crazy, guys. I tried to pull cards to save Alabaster, and it just fucked me up big time. I'm glad to be here. I really thought I was done for a second.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:32:53 Welcome back, dude. I'm so far away from you. Yeah. All right. Well, we still gotta kill this guy, right?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:32:56 No, instead you can cast a wish two more times.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:33:08 So, Jonathan, just as a question, do I have the other two wishes or was it to get my stuff back that the other two wishes were?
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:33:21 No, the magic item that I was going to put on your body was going to be a wish scroll. But since you got wish to get out, you just got your dagger and your leather armor back that had disintegrated when you had pulled the other card that disintegrated all of your magic items. So you look exactly the same.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:33:37 That's fair. So I'll just, uh, I'll just say, uh... Oh, you guys, I have... I have, uh, I have wish spells, so I'll wish the Alabaster's back up at full health. And, uh,
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:33:55 What? No. No. We're just... We're just... No.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:33:55 Okay. You, in fact, you cast heal because it'll be the most equivalent spell, which I believe is also like the ninth level 500 hit full one. So everybody gets back up to full health. No issue. Yeah. You know what? I think that is fair. He used a wish on this. You will all shed your point of exhaustion as well.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:33:56 No, do not do that. Do we also happen to lose our point of exhaustion with a spell like that? Because that seems powerful.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:33:58 Awesome.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:34:13 What else should I wish for, guys? What else should I wish for, guys? You guys want anything? Huh? Hmm? Don't I have
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:34:26 Wishes.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:34:28 wait can't you like stockpile your wishes you you don't have dude dude refill my fireball dude you're in my shell all the time all the time i'm sorry i went into cleavage mode right there
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:34:33 He doesn't have to spend it. That is true. He's got one more. Okay.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:34:55 You're hogging my fireball in my shell, dude. Fill it back up. I know you're drunk right now. Oh, shit. Wishes, yeah. Jesus.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:34:59 Is it? Um, maybe. I'll think about it. I only got one left. I only have one. I feel like that'll mean, like, the end of our characters, and we just worked so hard to get them back.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:35:07 You could absolutely do that at any point. You could wish to the right part.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:35:10 It makes sense. Wish us to the end of all of this. Let's just get to go where we're going.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:35:22 That's incredible. Just wish for me.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:35:25 Holy shit. Alright. Well, Barrow and Alabaster put yourselves up to the hole. Well, this fucker is still technically alive, is he not? Did we kill him?
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:35:32 I'll keep that in the back pocket in case things go badly.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:35:45 That'll be the end of the session right there.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:35:52 what uh what two what two stats did you take plus two to what a single one man you got so many good little perks off of that
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:35:58 Um... Oh, um... I haven't changed anything. I was too frazzled, actually. Um... It's just plus two to any single one. Yeah. I'll do, uh... Okay. Hmm.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:36:15 Increase one of your ability scores by two to a maximum of 24. You got the Sun card, which just let you keep your items. You got the Talon card, which destroyed all your items. You got the Throne, which gives you the expertise that you just used. And you are a property owner. You got the Sage card, which has you... You have the meditative answer you can get from the universe. You got the Moon card, which is Wish.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:36:39 Oh, forgot that one. Yeah, that was the crazy one.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:36:39 I got that. Oh yeah. So let's see. Alright, so.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:36:41 Yeah. To meditate, then wish for it.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:36:42 You have your Knight done. You got advantage on d20 rolls for the next three days. You got the Curse. You got Donjon, which was the first one. And that was it. Those were all of your pulls.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:36:52 Thank you.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:37:11 Let me do this. I'll change my dex, and then I'll do that. It's not letting me go any higher. It should be set at 16, but it's... Oh, you can only go up to 15 on point buy.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:37:29 Yeah, so it'd be in just your character sheet. You can adjust it. There's like an other bonus section. Shout out, successful from Travis.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:37:33 Yeah. So do all your regular spreads that you can manually add. We did great. We did great.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:37:44 That's crazy. Well, we almost lost two of our homies on second session with them. Yeah.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:37:59 shout out Jesse for pulling is that eight seven or eight deck of many cards in one session because it was five back to five after you pulled two plus the one you pulled from earlier and
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:38:11 Yeah. Yeah, that was rough. Yeah. Yeah.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:38:20 Crazy that it took damn near until the last card that you had to get you exactly what you needed. And then to get the max of it. Yeah.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:38:30 A couple of those where if you had picked the other direction, if you had said down or up instead of down, you would have picked something that probably would have killed you.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:38:39 I got what I needed and I could have stopped. The deck's gone, right? Magical items.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:38:40 Immediately die. How many of those cards can actually get you out of that predicament? It was really on the wish one, right? No, didn't that deck just vanish?
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:38:41 That was my only thought when I still had one card left after I rolled for the wishes. I was like, this one's going to kill me. Yeah. It got so close. Yeah. I think there's only a couple. No, they're gone. The deck's gone.
2-traceritops.ogg 02:38:50 Yeah, that's true. I think so. Unless there's a card. I mean, there's other cards that'll like teleport you to other things, I'm pretty sure.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:38:59 I can't tell you that. He still has more cards to pull. No, the deck is a wondrous item, I'm pretty sure. So everything that was magical was destroyed. So if he had had legendary gear, rings of protection, bags of holding, anything like that, well, maybe not bags of holding, I think that's wondrous too, would have been destroyed.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:39:27 Deck of Many Things is like magic above that. It's not going to get destroyed. Legendary Swords like the Holy Avenger would just teleport away. They're too powerful to get destroyed by that. You had a plus one thing.
6-bfschmity.ogg 02:39:32 Okay. Okay. So we got half that deck.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:39:33 Nice. Yeah, maybe he'll be a cleric. We cannot die.
1-kinglizard7958.ogg 02:39:55 Kind of cool you got a squire out of it, though.
5-joeeeenathan.ogg 02:40:02 He's a knight, so he's a fighter class.
4-jessev567890.ogg 02:40:05 Oh, okay. Sweet. Do I have to voice him too since he's basically me?

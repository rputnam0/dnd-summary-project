Cyrus Schwert 00:00:00 Come here, buddy.
Dungeon Master 00:00:01 All righty. Last session was kind of a doozy. The recap made me realize way more happened than I remembered happening. But the session started off with Cowden in his trance-like state, finding himself slipping into a magically induced sleep.
Kaladen Shash 00:00:01 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:06 That's great.
Dungeon Master 00:00:29 He wasn't just dreaming, though. He was falling. After finally landing in a nice three-point landing, he realized he was in a lucid state of some sort of controlled descent. Before that, he landed on a large circular platform of black glass surrounded by similar dark sheer currents. Jesus Christ, I've got to pull it together.
Dungeon Master 00:00:52 A place that he'd been before. This dreamscape you did through a really nice intelligence slash perception check. Realized that you were in the astral sea. You walked down a tunnel before being confronted with the same sort of nightmarish features. Corrupted fey elf looking creature who had previously claimed to be of your blood. You threw conversation.
Dungeon Master 00:01:22 Still being very vague, he revealed to himself as the equivalent of a very distant and old uncle. And that somehow you had been bound at a soul level. Your core essences are tied together somehow. And that because of this, it was in some interest of him to keep you alive and safe in Degaijin. He gave you a warning not to trust where you're coming from. The First Council, which is...
Dungeon Master 00:01:51 very popularly known as like the very lead figure of any dome. It's the first council who is a member of the high council, usually a very accomplished mage. He told you not to trust them and that he gave you a hint to return to New New Arbor when you went through the way that you'd been before to see the deceit.
Dungeon Master 00:02:18 um answering just a couple questions keeping it very brief he then disappeared into the void you guys woke up in the hut um cleatus uh in his very enthusiastic way brewed up his latest creation almond joe as cup of almond joe for himself and chip um you then uh
Dungeon Master 00:02:42 kept going, and then eventually, at some point, through your sort of arduous trek in the increasingly more dense forest, Cyrus rolled a natural 20, picking up a very faint dinging, sort of like a chiming sound in the distance. It took a little bit of convincing, but you got the party to follow you there, wherein you came to an opening in the forest that showed a
Cyrus Schwert 00:02:59 It's just a twinkle.
Dungeon Master 00:03:12 massive, like, I think I described it as 10 to 15 foot tall amethyst crystal structure, a sculpture that looked like a dragon. And over it were heavy iron chains in this field of large jutting gem and crystals, like low cut bluish grass.
Dungeon Master 00:03:34 On it, it described how the gem dragons had been locked away however many years ago due to the potential of their power. It was signed, well, inscribed, sort of attributed to some being called Belendril. Below that, it said, free the gemstone dragons and gain a boon. Through some discussion, you guys decided to
Dungeon Master 00:04:04 in conjunction with each other, break the lock that held everything together, and this huge arcane beam shot from the ground, alighting on the arcane circle that you were in, throwing everybody back. Nobody cleared the space. Taking high amounts of damage, you guys all found that you were given a once-a-day shield spell. After this, Zariel had a brief conversation with
Zariel Torgan 00:04:27 Awesome.
Dungeon Master 00:04:32 with the Lord Marshall Thurr through the ascending spell a couple ways back. Just reopening conversation, he revealed that he could tell that you were no longer of his lycanthropic blood, but that he also knew that you had what is in reality he described as his grandchildren equivalents, but you only heard
Dungeon Master 00:04:58 um like daughter again so in your guys's head it's still like under the assumption that these are his kids um you sort of retorted back that you why should you trust him um he's done nothing is he still sieging this city uh and then you revealed their name i forget exactly was it was like coco and something snow that's right
Cyrus Schwert 00:05:14 Snowball.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:23 Yeah, Snowball and Cocoa.
Dungeon Master 00:05:25 a light touch to the end of the conversation the party then fought the what was supposed to be very intimidating knoll captain leader emory razorback in his wyvern mount but i think in total in the fight across everything i landed two total hits and he got absolutely won his mount beheaded
Dungeon Master 00:05:53 um you guys arrested him he put him in cuffs and took him to the camp to interrogate uh pretty quickly realizing that he was pretty much only concerned with bloodlust he was out to kill um and challenge you and that there wasn't a whole lot more intent behind his actions other than to gain power um in which case uh
Cyrus Schwert 00:06:19 The nose.
Dungeon Master 00:06:21 leopold let him go and then cut him down as he ran um i think yeah i at that point i think kaladin had finished your ring of protection and started on a like a ring of stealth spell storing right but for like shield right
Leopold Magnus 00:06:26 Serves him right as the leader of the nose.
Kaladen Shash 00:06:38 Yeah, but only for one spell and hoping that that would make it go faster. Just for shield, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:06:49 gotcha uh zariel now with his lost connection took a little more traditional approach to training the werewolf pups who are getting close to their potentially first full moon um but completed the how to hide action to keep them out of combat but to not have the need to be in the toolbox at all times now they can sort of be directed
Dungeon Master 00:07:14 And then as you guys woke the next morning, you traveled further into the jungle. The final encounter check over the next two days of your travel was a three, but it was also the last thing on the encounter check. You had knocked out everything already. And where we ended it was as you guys are traveling forward towards what you know to be
Dungeon Master 00:07:36 moon haven you guys are noticing as the canopy grows larger overhead and more dense less light getting through as you get closer to this area there are huge amounts of spider webs and cobwebs and these definitely like high traffic spider highways way above you in the canopy that you can just see cascading over everything with strands coming down to the ground you can tell that
Cletus Cobbington 00:07:48 Hello.
Dungeon Master 00:08:04 There's like a general shift in the environment and the theme, but you guys nevertheless are very carefully moving. What would the O'Dears like to do as time is passing? This is getting more dense and more prominent over the span of like hours, half hours to hours, you know, breaking it up in little increments as you move forward.
Leopold Magnus 00:08:27 Jonathan, did we long rest after killing Emery? Okay. Oh, wait, we... Okay, I think... Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:08:30 Yes, this is, yeah, you've had a long rest. I think that's when you leveled up. I don't remember totally, but you guys are, either way, you had a long rest and this was, no, sorry. If you'd already leveled up, that's done. This is after that. This is two days worth of travels, one event. So you have a long rest and then you get moving. So for all accounts and purposes, you're topped off.
Cyrus Schwert 00:08:41 Are we leveled up again? OK. I was like, no way.
Leopold Magnus 00:08:58 Cool. I was just wondering, does this shift in the biome seem to have any kind of connection to magic? Is there a way I could get a feel for that? Or would that be kind of past what somebody could determine? Because I do have detect magic. OK.
Dungeon Master 00:09:05 You could throw it at a tech magic.
Leopold Magnus 00:09:23 Yeah, I will cast... Well, let me make sure I get my long rest, so that way all my spells get refreshed. But I'll cast Detect Magic and see if there's anything I can get a read on. Okay. Oh, okay, cool. I didn't know that was a thing. That's
Dungeon Master 00:09:34 Well, and don't even worry about spending a slot because this could be ritual cast as you guys are moving through. So you just spend, I don't know, 10 minutes to cast a spell instead of one action. Also a benefit of the wizard. Anything that has an R? Yeah, if there's an R next to the spell, you can, instead of spending the slot, just take extra time to do it.
Kaladen Shash 00:09:49 You're a wizard, man. You're a wizard.
Zariel Torgan 00:09:52 Heh heh heh heh heh.
Leopold Magnus 00:09:52 So that's how ritual casting works. Yeah. Oh, no shit. Okay, cool. Yeah, so I'll do that. I'll do a detect magic.
Dungeon Master 00:10:11 And then go ahead and give me an Arcana check on top of it. Oh, good roll. It was a high DC, so it was good that you got it. Detect Magic doesn't reveal anything, I would say, inherently magical. You are...
Leopold Magnus 00:10:22 24.
Kaladen Shash 00:10:24 Right.
Cyrus Schwert 00:10:30 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:10:37 going through and it's like maybe coming off your armor off of like an antenna and just pinging out right you are trying to get a sense and every once in a while and caledon would notice this but he's um let's say a little distracted he's not trying to search but you get the sense of like fey magic where fey magic isn't really a school of magic like it's not abjuration divination you know
Dungeon Master 00:11:01 conjuration or anything like that it's like if you could tell if you could feel magic that was pure chaos that's like the epitome of fey magic so you were getting this sense of like just raw magic kind of faintly in the air every once in a while which
Leopold Magnus 00:11:09 Interesting. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:11:18 you don't even need to make a basic history check for. You know that each of the domes had obviously certain influences to its location, its general magic type, its architecture. Moonhaven was very elven and fey in influence in general. So you can tell you are much closer to this city, but you don't know why you're experiencing it necessarily. You're obviously not in the city, so to feel fey magic,
Dungeon Master 00:11:47 I wouldn't say it's necessarily normal, but you could make some logical steps to be like, okay, this forest has got fey magic because we're near Moonhaven. That wouldn't be a far stretch.
Cletus Cobbington 00:11:58 you you
Leopold Magnus 00:11:59 I see. Okay, yeah. So I guess Leopold will be walking. You see his little antenna kind of... And it locks on. And I just pause and I turn to Kaladin and I'll say, Kaladin, lots of wild magic in the air. Can you feel that?
Kaladen Shash 00:12:16 With my mask on, would I just understand that that's around? Or would I need the ritual cast to detect magic as well? Turn them.
Dungeon Master 00:12:26 I love that you mentioned the mask specifically. Maybe it's like hanging around your neck or something. Kaladin, you put on your mask, and every time he does it, you see when he puts on his mask, his ears get a little longer. He gets a little bit more like a lithe form, like he gets a little more primal elf. And Kaladin, when you have it on, you see this faint trail of magic sort of dancing through the air in front of you, almost like you have a beacon.
Cletus Cobbington 00:12:53 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:12:53 forward, pulling you in one direction. And with it is the faint smell of wild
Kaladen Shash 00:12:56 Yes, I see this. I do see what you're talking about. We should follow. Do you see this line, Leopold? Do you see this?
Leopold Magnus 00:13:07 Yes, it's quite interesting. Oh, indeed. What? Where? Oh, no, I don't think so. I'm just sensing the... I'm picking it up. My antennas are reading some magic. But I don't know where it is. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:13:26 this way is it fairly obvious or does it require like some searching Jonathan or is it like oh there it is just keep following the line okay sensing okay
Dungeon Master 00:13:36 out of game is going to give because you put the mask on there's a benefit to that for something later but in game it's not like a direct path but more of like you when you put the mask on you sort of directly connect yourself to fey the fey energy in you you it like you can see where it gets stronger there is an obvious path to go and it's manifesting as like this
Kaladen Shash 00:14:02 Shall we follow the line?
Dungeon Master 00:14:04 like fairy magic kind of line dancing in front of you. Give me a perception check.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:20 Oh, I don't see any other reason not to. I... I'm gonna try something.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:24 Yeah, sounds good. Yeah. Can I also take a look around and see if they're like looking at us like they want to eat us?
Cyrus Schwert 00:14:26 There's just like a million spiders going on. Banger perception. Exactly what I was going to say.
Kaladen Shash 00:14:33 That's good. Not real well.
Cletus Cobbington 00:14:39 i like spiders they keep the almonds so you feed all the nasty things trying to eat them
Dungeon Master 00:14:41 I'm going to say that Leopold and Kaladin, who were talking and doing this, will be out of the check, but it doesn't matter because Cyrus was so high anyway. And Zaryul... Oh! Jesse, what happened, man? What the fuck was that, dude?
Kaladen Shash 00:15:03 Ooh, coming in light. Get focused.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:04 first low one in a while. I'm playing with the dogs. Nice.
Cyrus Schwert 00:15:05 Wow. Wow. That was stark.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:07 Jesus.
Dungeon Master 00:15:10 27, 24, 27. Damn. The two of you who are like maybe losing interest in this conversation because it's like, it's like an inside joke that you're not a part of. You don't know what the fuck they're talking about because one, this mask hasn't really been explained to you that Kaladin has on his face. And Leopold's so directly addressing the fact that Kaladin's got this connection. It's like totally going over your head.
Cletus Cobbington 00:15:13 I got an eye for spiders. What can I say? I start flipping his longer ears.
Dungeon Master 00:15:38 Zariel is just, maybe his mind is elsewhere. He's looking at a flower or something. Yeah. But you guys pay attention and you see up in the canopy an innumerable amount of spiders moving around. Skittering gently, you see the web sort of bounces at certain points, as you can tell. Larger forms are moving across it. And on the ground next to you, as you're walking forward, not aggressively, but you do see like
Zariel Torgan 00:15:42 Playing with the dogs.
Kaladen Shash 00:15:45 Playing with the dogs.
Dungeon Master 00:16:09 like the the top the entrance of a tunnel web spider area where it's like a very web sort of circular thing that kind of pops up and you see like the little arachnid appendages the sort of like sitting the very very edge ready if you got too close to jump out and try to bite you as you were like walking through this supernest
Kaladen Shash 00:16:33 No.
Cletus Cobbington 00:16:33 Didn't know a spirit Halloween was out here. Watch out for the step button.
Leopold Magnus 00:16:33 Does Cyrus look pretty freaked out? I'm going to do an insight check on the spiders. Yeah, I don't get anything.
Cyrus Schwert 00:16:33 Hello spiders. It's a spirit Halloween in the off season. I actually really like spiders. Flies are disgusting and they keep the flies away. I hate flies. An insight about what
Zariel Torgan 00:16:40 Peace. Peace.
Dungeon Master 00:16:46 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:17:01 Wait, I like that guy's energy.
Cyrus Schwert 00:17:03 Yeah. What are your intentions with my daughter? Whoa. That spider was wearing a Kangol hat.
Kaladen Shash 00:17:04 Whatever their intention was.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:05 Oh! The ocean. I'll kind of flinch. And I'm going to...
Dungeon Master 00:17:08 you look at a very specific spider that after Cyrus out loud says that he doesn't fuck with flies like it almost tips its hat if it had one and then it looks at you and it kind of does this and then it keeps walking and you don't know what it means but it seemed really aggressive um okay cool
Zariel Torgan 00:17:13 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:35 I was going to say, I'm going to summon a tiny conjuration. I'm going to make it look like a little spider. And I've got this magical tinkering. Can I make it just walk around a little bit? I'm going to sneak it on to Zariel's shoulder.
Dungeon Master 00:17:48 Okay. Sure. Just a little spider having fun. You could give me a perception check. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:17:56 He's dilly dallying. Oh!
Cyrus Schwert 00:17:57 Like all over you.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:03 I feel like I would notice, but you know, you could just put it there. Well, to be fair, I rolled like a three on my other perception, so I'm probably pretty distracted. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:18:08 I'm going to try. Should I do a slight hand check to hide it on him? You rolled a three. I rolled a five.
Dungeon Master 00:18:24 Well, a five is lower than your passive, so then go ahead and give me an active perception check. I think it's spectral. It's not something you would feel. You'd have to see it. 17, yeah. It would have been really cool, except he was in front of you when he turns around and does it, so you watch him ponder it.
Kaladen Shash 00:18:26 yeah this is
Leopold Magnus 00:18:39 Oh yeah, he spotted it. That's funny.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:39 That's a cool spider. Hey, keep that away from me. I'm just going to jump away.
Cletus Cobbington 00:18:40 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:18:55 And then back to it before, Cletus with such a high roll. You see them definitely all around you, but as you guys move forward, you can tell that there's a lot directly behind you slowly encroaching, almost waiting for like a next stop. So if you basically feel like you only have forward to go, they're all around, they're on top, presumably they're below, and they are behind you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:18:57 pretty soon.
Cletus Cobbington 00:19:15 Can I cast Animal Friendship on the one that tipped his fedora? Well, what if I was doing that while Leopold is messing with the spider?
Leopold Magnus 00:19:31 What is your...
Kaladen Shash 00:19:31 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:19:33 Give me a luck check to see if he's still in range, because I did say he just kind of skittered off after that. Okay. Fair point. Counterpoint. What is your intention with this fighter?
Cyrus Schwert 00:19:43 Right.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:45 spider bites you
Cletus Cobbington 00:19:49 I roll the net one. Well, I just want a little homie. I want to ask him some questions. Might as well make him be nice. I got some charges on my staff. Like, wait, hold on. And then he's like, I turn around. He's just not there at all. Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:20:03 Nat 1. You burn a charge. He's just gone. Nat 1 is bad enough. You expend the charge. He is picking up speed.
Cletus Cobbington 00:20:19 Darn, too bad there isn't a million spiders right around me. I wanted that specific one. All right, I'm gonna start frolicking after this fey magic. Why don't we?
Kaladen Shash 00:20:36 Do the spiders look pretty disinterested in us? Like that one just sort of was like whatever? I was just saying if they were all that way. No? No? No? No?
Dungeon Master 00:20:36 Okay. Well, that one was more of a joke between the encounter. If you want to give me an insight check, actually, if you want to, to discern intent as well. 22. Way better. They seem keenly interested in you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:20:48 Fair enough.
Cletus Cobbington 00:20:51 Hmm.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:01 Pretty good. Yeah. Mm.
Kaladen Shash 00:21:07 yes be cautious my friends yes
Dungeon Master 00:21:11 As a way to phrase it in a meta sort of understandable way, the consequence of the free encounter check might be manifesting itself. As you guys definitely feel as though you are being funneled a certain direction. As you guys are moving through, you see...
Cletus Cobbington 00:21:21 Hello. Hello.
Dungeon Master 00:21:38 Everything is getting a little bit more directly funneled, and you can tell that you've meandered into what is essentially like this large-scale trap. As you can tell, the spiders are sort of closing in behind, and then as everything starts...
Kaladen Shash 00:21:41 Crazy.
Cyrus Schwert 00:21:46 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:21:57 lay out the scene, you have effectively 60 feet of straight vision unobstructed. The path isn't as straight as the map I've created makes it look. I want it to be obvious the direction you're supposed to go. But it's windy. There's roots. There's trees. There's gaps you have to leap. And there's not a clear line of vision. There's a lot of spider webs you have to avoid.
Dungeon Master 00:22:25 But as you guys are moving forward and maybe you're picking up a little bit of speed before one of the spiders in the ground sort of throws up the lid on it and it comes out with its fangs and its long legs and it comes forward and you have to jump out of the way before it actively starts pursuing. And as we jump into, we'll do initiative in a moment, you guys have to sort of go into a dead sprint as you see all of the spiders around you start
Dungeon Master 00:22:54 Instantly running towards you, down the trees, through the webs. You hear them jumping through the foliage behind as you guys have to sprint in the only area that there's not them, which coincidentally happens to be the direction you need to go. Mechanically, how this is going to work is there is 600 total feet to...
Dungeon Master 00:23:18 to make it through which at 60 feet vision at a time unless you've got more or less distance is 10 rounds of what is going to be a gauntlet style encounter every round more things are going to add on to the previous round and so if you fall behind you are mechanically doomed there will be an impossible amount to overcome later in so this will be teamwork
Kaladen Shash 00:23:20 Okay. swarmed
Cyrus Schwert 00:23:38 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:23:44 Focus on movement. Every round you're going to have to make sort of a deck save type scenario to not get stuck in webs. And if you get stuck in a web, your action economy will have to be dedicated to breaking it. There's a small amount of HP for each web you get stuck in. There's certain ways to give yourself a little bit of boons each round as well. If you do something in sort of a cool way, you'll get like...
Dungeon Master 00:24:09 For example, Leopold's Searing Saber as fire damage might make it easier, or teleportation might give you benefits here, you know, those kind of things. But that is how this encounter is going to run. So in combat initiative, is everybody rolling yet? Go ahead and roll initiative.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:30 i'll do it now
Leopold Magnus 00:24:30 I haven't rolled initiative. Yeah, let me do that.
Cletus Cobbington 00:24:33 Jesus.
Kaladen Shash 00:24:35 Going late. Gosh, 6, 8, 9. Okay, never mind. I thought I was going to get the bottom there. Oh, Nat 20 was not just a 22.
Cyrus Schwert 00:24:37 I got an eight, a six, eight, nine, and a 22.
Dungeon Master 00:24:44 It doesn't super matter when you get it. It's just the order things are going to happen in. Yeah, you know what? I'll say that's fair. I've made what is going to be a very hard encounter sort of scenario. Everybody will get a free round to do something.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:54 Would we get a chance to get a spell off before we're getting an action off before this happens? Or is it just bam? Okay. Yeah, I'm going to cast Fire Shield on myself. So my floating shield is going to just...
Cyrus Schwert 00:25:09 I'm going to pat everybody on the back and cast Enhance Ability for
Dungeon Master 00:25:18 Nice.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:22 turn into flames, and I'm going to put it out in front of me. Hopefully, it'll melt some spider webs. I mean, mechanically, it doesn't, but you know. Nice.
Cyrus Schwert 00:25:40 however many levels it takes to do everybody, and give us advantage on dex checks for the next hour until I lose concentration.
Cletus Cobbington 00:25:41 I'm going to coin flip almonds to everybody and cast Longstrider. It just said target speed increases by 10 feet.
Dungeon Master 00:25:50 Now, long strider eliminates difficult terrain, right? Because that's clutch. Okay. Everything is difficult terrain.
Kaladen Shash 00:25:54 Excellent. That's really good, actually. No.
Leopold Magnus 00:25:57 That's awesome.
Cyrus Schwert 00:26:15 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:26:17 Okay, so does that mean it doesn't really do anything? Gotcha. Sure.
Dungeon Master 00:26:20 Oh, freedom of movement is... No, you get extra... It gives you the extra movement, which is countered, but if something else paired with it, you would have way extra movement. Let's say you get a nat 20 on something, you'd get a free round of full movement unencumbered. Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:23 Yeah. Oops.
Leopold Magnus 00:26:41 Jonathan, I have a question. So I have this spell. It's called Warding Wind. Where is it? And it effectively just creates a 10-foot...
Cyrus Schwert 00:26:45 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:26:59 Yeah, 10-foot bubble of 20-mile-an-hour winds that deafens, extinguishes flames, and hedges out vapors and gases. The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you. Would that keep the cobwebs away? Presumably, if I have this whipping gust of air surrounding me, do you think that would keep the cobwebs from tying me up?
Cyrus Schwert 00:27:21 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:27:26 No, because then that bypasses the whole encounter, but I'll say you can get a lower DC or advantage on certain checks with it on. Because a lot of it's not just the webs. The web is a part of it. It is the chase by spiders, the uneven terrain, the roots, the trees, the gaps, things like that that is making it so difficult.
Leopold Magnus 00:27:36 OK. Then I'll cast that for my action. Yeah. No, that makes sense. So it'll just lower the DC a little bit. Cool.
Kaladen Shash 00:27:39 I'm going to cast Bless.
Cletus Cobbington 00:27:51 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:28:01 Yeah. Go through it. I want to find this one.
Kaladen Shash 00:28:07 I'll upcast it at, I think, third level to get five people on the spell. So that should be helpful. That'll hold for at least 10 rounds of this now initiative, assuming that it might last most of it.
Leopold Magnus 00:28:20 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:28:21 Oh, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:28:31 Yeah, he's doing what?
Cyrus Schwert 00:28:32 So it's a d4 to save or attack. We have advantage on dexterity. Who has the best dex?
Kaladen Shash 00:28:35 to saves or attacks like if you've got to fend off something you'll have a a bonus to the to hit so right now we've got what what benefits are we looking at so we have bless up long strider that's right in enhanceability um
Zariel Torgan 00:28:51 Not me.
Cletus Cobbington 00:28:55 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:02 Why not me?
Kaladen Shash 00:29:03 What am I at? I'm getting pretty high just because of the fighter. I have... No, I don't proficiency in acrobatics or athletics. I have a... Oh, no, no, no. I'm good. I'm good on saving throws. I'm good on decks, I guess. I have a plus 10 already. I don't need advantage. I should be able to clear the bar.
Cyrus Schwert 00:29:05 Anybody have proficiency? I have to leave someone out of it. Who do you think it should be? Because I want to keep my fifth level. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:35 So I guess, Jonathan, that bubble of air, we could all move in that, right? 10 foot? Let me see. Oh, I see.
Cyrus Schwert 00:29:36 Thank you. Have to be right next to them.
Dungeon Master 00:29:42 everybody would have to be oh yeah well do you get to pick who's affected by it because you're not the kind of wizard who can exclude people
Kaladen Shash 00:29:43 You'd have to sculpt it only if it's evocation. He's not school of evocation. That's what I'm saying. So it's just going to be only him. Everybody else is going to take damage. It just slows everybody down.
Cletus Cobbington 00:29:50 Oh.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:07 No, there's no damage associated with it. But it would be death and it hedges out vapors. Yeah, you would have double difficult terrain. Okay. I'll run out front and try to clear the field, I guess. Or actually, you know what? I'll post up the rear. I'll just come in behind you guys.
Dungeon Master 00:30:11 It's just only he would get the benefit.
Kaladen Shash 00:30:14 Yeah. That's all.
Cyrus Schwert 00:30:26 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:30:37 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:30:39 Are you intentionally moving yourself to the bottom of the order then, like mechanically? Like holding your action to be in the back? OK. I'll just say you're last to act by choice so you don't hurt them. Valiant choice. OK. At the top of the round, ahead of an initiative count 20, Zariel, you were up first.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:45 yeah exactly to kind of take the back of the pack yeah
Zariel Torgan 00:31:09 Alright, so... Let's see... Um... I'm just gonna... Hmm... I've got 30 feet of movement, and I used my action... Oh, 40 feet! Yeah, yeah, okay, sweet. I'll just take my movement, and as I move forward, do I see anything? Does anything happen? Move myself up here. Damn, 40 feet is not a lot.
Cletus Cobbington 00:31:10 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:31:22 40 feet.
Dungeon Master 00:31:41 no you don't see anything happen yet like other than again that the scene is pretty intense with like there are a lot of spiders swarming towards you but like nothing has happened yet
Zariel Torgan 00:31:45 I guess I'll hold my action then I'll just move out with my movement hold my action and see if anything happens to anybody before moving forward
Cletus Cobbington 00:32:06 you
Dungeon Master 00:32:12 Okay, what action are you holding? What's the plan? You can always bail on them. As a reminder, if your thing doesn't come to pass, you can change it. You just have to say it before the round ends. What's the intent? Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:22 Yeah, I think I've got a spell I could cast. It's as a buff, but it's just for one person. So if somebody fails super hard, I'm thinking about using that. Yeah, otherwise, if that doesn't work, I'll probably just run. I just don't want to leave everybody. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:32:44 Okay. Holding that, moving 40 feet up next is Kaladin. Oh, sorry. Layer action 20. This is what happens next. I'll roll this just to... That's it.
Cyrus Schwert 00:32:57 18 spiders. How about two full packs of wolves? That'll probably help. Are they fast? Jizz.
Kaladen Shash 00:32:59 Yeah, we need our Rizzlers out. Yeah, man. You just got to overwhelm them while we run.
Cletus Cobbington 00:33:04 We do. Nah, four Rizzlers will do the trick. Riz, Tiz, Biz, and Stiz. Oh, man.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:11 That would be good.
Dungeon Master 00:33:23 You see, of all the spiders swarming you, six large, just like I would say generic-looking spiders, technically classified as wolf spiders, sort of break free and ahead of the group and are clear into your way. And with them, there's mechanically a swarm of spiders moving in as well. And I'll add them into initiative in a sec. But that's what you see. After that, Kaladin, it is your go.
Kaladen Shash 00:33:56 I'm going to follow his footsteps to move 40 feet. And then I'm going to go ahead and misty step another 30. And then I think there's coming in from the side somewhere. We're getting ready to drop.
Dungeon Master 00:34:14 I'm doing it right now.
Cletus Cobbington 00:34:15 Where were these spiders? Sorry. Okay. Sorry.
Kaladen Shash 00:34:25 And then I'll hold my action of just like some sort of supportive esoteric blast. And that's just a, well, that's a bonus action. I already missed a step. I'll hold Firebolt. What's that? I'm holding my action.
Cyrus Schwert 00:34:45 Did you pull dash action? Did you like double dash or just your normal movement? Yeah. All right. I got it.
Kaladen Shash 00:34:55 Yeah, I just used usual movement, bonus actions, misty stepped. If I don't have to hold my action, I'll dash another 40. All right, so if I don't have to make an attack, that's my intent, run the other 40 feet.
Cletus Cobbington 00:35:08 Send it.
Dungeon Master 00:35:11 All of those spiders there. You do that. And then because the thing has already happened and they're up an initiative, Cyrus, Cletus, and Leopold in that order, but tell me what you guys do with your turn because spiders will move next round. So nothing's going to happen. No, they don't make it in.
Cyrus Schwert 00:35:15 I'm going to send it.
Cletus Cobbington 00:35:35 So they aren't able to opportunity attack us from there, is what you're saying? OK, cool. Just a rat. Yep. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:35:41 just arriving if you have 40 one strike
Cyrus Schwert 00:35:46 So we have 10 extra feet of movement? Like we have 40 movement now? I'm just going to eat. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. And that's
Leopold Magnus 00:35:53 Oh, nice. That's huge. Let's see, 40 feet. Let's see. Well, 40 feet would only just get me to Zariel.
Dungeon Master 00:36:01 Okay, see this? Leopold?
Cletus Cobbington 00:36:04 Yeah, do the same. We all say, see you, Zario. You could dash, use your action to dash.
Leopold Magnus 00:36:24 All right. Oh, yeah, I see. I will. Jonathan, this is all just heavily spider webbed, right? And spider webs are flammable. At least the web is. I'm going to cast Burning Hands like kind of up on this plateau. See what's the range on Burning Hands.
Kaladen Shash 00:36:25 Right. If you use your action to dash now, stay in front of the spiders.
Dungeon Master 00:36:37 Yeah. Yep. Oh, that is a bush that I drew, but you can do it there anyway. Yes.
Cyrus Schwert 00:36:42 I just lawyered you and things like that.
Kaladen Shash 00:36:59 15 feet cone yep
Leopold Magnus 00:37:00 uh it's a 15 feet right so like i could potentially reach those guys yeah it's a basically i'll just move on that one side is ariel so that way like i'm close to that grouping and i'll shoot a 15 foot cone adam burning hands 17 yep
Dungeon Master 00:37:07 Yeah. And that's a deck save. They will just do a group check because they're all together. That is a 14.
Cyrus Schwert 00:37:18 Thanks.
Cletus Cobbington 00:37:28 This girl is on fire. Hell yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:37:37 Okay, so fail. 46. Let's go. 15 damage. Pretty good.
Dungeon Master 00:37:40 Right, go ahead and roll damage. Leopold, how do you roast these spiders?
Kaladen Shash 00:37:47 to go.
Leopold Magnus 00:37:55 Yeah. So I run, run as fast as I can. There's a massive deafening wall of wind howling. And I run up to Zario and I go, stand back. And I blast from tubes underneath my arms, flames. And I just do a pirouette spinning and spraying flames everywhere.
Cyrus Schwert 00:37:58 So,
Kaladen Shash 00:38:17 helicopter.
Leopold Magnus 00:38:18 And there's just, yeah, there's nothing but burned scorched earth and some roasted spider carcasses. Yeah, moved.
Dungeon Master 00:38:23 Yeah. The forest behind you guys is effectively on fire and spreading, but you guys are always going to move faster than on fire spread, so it's just going to kind of be left in the back to burn. But at the end of that, any movement out of you? No, you didn't. Cool. Zoriel, the top of the round. Unless you do something at the end of the round, the start of the round, it's your turn.
Cletus Cobbington 00:38:24 Pick them up, that's a delicacy.
Kaladen Shash 00:38:50 I was going to say, since I didn't have to use my action, can I go ahead and use my other 40 feet of movement there, Jonathan, like I dashed? All right. Yeah. Just get that in.
Zariel Torgan 00:38:50 Yeah, I think I'll just... Oh, go ahead. Yeah, same here. Is Leo... Oh, he's behind.
Dungeon Master 00:39:01 Mm-hmm. Yep. Yeah. Keep up with the group. Okay, then. Mm-hmm. At the end of that start of the round, Zaria lets you go.
Cyrus Schwert 00:39:19 Thanks.
Kaladen Shash 00:39:22 He burned his action on spiders.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:23 All right. I'm going to cast with my action. I'm going to cast Freedom of the Winds at fifth level on Leo. Oh, it's touch.
Leopold Magnus 00:39:26 Yep. Oh, damn. You could have done it right before you left.
Dungeon Master 00:39:47 range on that he can hold it this time and wait for you to catch up but that would leave him behind
Zariel Torgan 00:39:53 Ouch. Okay. Uh, no, because I held my movement. Um... Shit. Okay. Never mind. Yeah, leave me behind. It's okay. That is what I'll do. I'll, uh... If you're... Yeah. Okay, well then I'm gonna use my... Let's see.
Kaladen Shash 00:39:57 Now last round. It just it just means. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:40:00 Oh, I see. Yeah, that's alright. I've got something.
Cletus Cobbington 00:40:08 He dropped the baton.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:22 I wanted to use my bonus action, but maybe I'll save it. So I will do that. I'll move up 40 feet. I'll hold my action for a touch on somebody with this if they get in trouble. Otherwise, I'll use my action to move. I'll move 40 feet and then hold the same thing as last time. Otherwise, I'll just run.
Dungeon Master 00:40:44 OK. And sorry, that was the start of the second round. I was supposed to make you a dex save. So at the end of the turn instead of the beginning, go and make your dex save, just because I forgot that. Yep.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:55 And I get advantage, right? Okay. Okay. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Let's let's see.
Cletus Cobbington 00:40:58 Hell yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:41:00 Yeah. And a D4 if you need it. It's just safe. Plus that D4. Get that D4 on there. That's all it needs to beat it. Go get it. Yeah, boy! Woo! Woo! Woo!
Cyrus Schwert 00:41:00 Might as well use a D4. What is the DC's 12? Oh, is it 12?
Leopold Magnus 00:41:12 Oh, okay. Better than average.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:26 Is it? Oh! Nice. Yeah. I'm running, and I just trip. Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:41:27 The DC was 12. Low DC, high stakes on a failure. You are not mechanically stuck to a web with a speed of zero for the rest of the round. So that goes off of that initiative account 20.
Cyrus Schwert 00:41:29 Oh, come on. Let's go.
Kaladen Shash 00:41:30 Oh, terrible. Good to know.
Cletus Cobbington 00:41:30 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:41:54 D12, you see always that. You see Leopold as you...
Cyrus Schwert 00:42:01 Two T-Rexes. Jesse, what animal do you need to polymorph into? Two unicorns.
Leopold Magnus 00:42:03 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:42:06 Look,
Kaladen Shash 00:42:08 Oh goodness.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:13 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:42:14 spin around and you throw this wall of flames that torches all of these spiders. The flames lick this huge rock on the backside of you as you spin and the rock tracks and breaks and you see that what you thought was a rock was this sort of stone spider that had been like sort of huddled up and together for who knows how long, breaks open and this huge spider looks at you as you are running by.
Dungeon Master 00:42:43 um and acting on initiative count 20 is going to move in for an attack it'll take that'll be a natural one to hit uh and then uh nat 2 shout out to crew for a 15 to hit guys this is what i'm good at
Leopold Magnus 00:42:58 Nope. Nope, miss. I'm gonna shield. Yeah, I'm gonna shield.
Kaladen Shash 00:42:59 Wow. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:59 That's what you wanna see. Nice. Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:43:14 And then on a web strand attack, a 21 to hit. Oh, ignore that. That last one isn't anything. Go ahead.
Cyrus Schwert 00:43:14 The three, come on.
Leopold Magnus 00:43:28 So no. Uh, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:43:28 Reaction. Good. No. Carry it for the round. Yeah. Okay. Got to disengage right there. Shielded. Shielded.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:33 It's a good time to shield too. It's a long time before your turn. Yeah. Jesus Christ.
Dungeon Master 00:43:42 These guys can't possibly hit you, but there's also a Swarm of Spiders. They only have a plus 3 to hit, though, so it's a nat 20. Oh, 22? I think your shield goes way above that. Yeah. Yeah, after that Kaladin.
Leopold Magnus 00:43:57 Yeah, shielded on 2026. Yeah, it's pretty good. Pretty good. Yeah. Let's do the armor and protect it.
Kaladen Shash 00:44:01 He's hard to hit. Tough shell. For a caster, that's what I love. If possible, it is. I'm going to use my action to cast top of my turn. I don't have enhancement or enhancement ability.
Zariel Torgan 00:44:10 Oh.
Cyrus Schwert 00:44:11 Not with advantage. Yeah, I only did it on three of us. I didn't want to burn a fifth level spell slot for that. So I don't have it either.
Cletus Cobbington 00:44:16 Oops.
Dungeon Master 00:44:19 Oh, sorry. Start of your turn. Give me a dexterity saving throw with advantage. DC 12. Oh, dexterity saving throw. That's right.
Kaladen Shash 00:44:34 Yeah. Oh, yeah. Here we go. That's humongous. Jesus.
Cletus Cobbington 00:44:44 Is that guy actually that big? That guy is huge. Gotcha. I would say that is pretty good.
Dungeon Master 00:44:49 It's not as gross as it looks. This was just the closest thing to the next level spider I could find. But if you guys want to see what it shows it looking like, it shows it as a nasty thing. Again, not big, but that kind of grotesque. Everything fits into a ball rock. Kaladin 16 beats it. You have your round to move without being stuck to a web.
Cyrus Schwert 00:44:49 That's a big party. Yeah, that's Chris. You might
Leopold Magnus 00:45:00 Oh, fucking eaten an airship.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:04 All right. OK. I'll cast from here as a bonus action the Soptric Blast, and I'll send
Dungeon Master 00:45:29 Technically, it is a swarm of spiders. Oh man, you're asking the real questions here. It does not say. I'm going to say there's like 150.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:33 Is this a single entity over here? Wherever this thing is? Okay, it's a whole swarm again. How many is in a swarm? The real questions.
Kaladen Shash 00:46:00 All right, all cast. Can I cast Shatter? It's a 10-foot radius. And just try to encapsulate as many as I can right there. It's going to be a constitution saved by that horde of spiders. Okay, okay. Okay. Yeah, that's better. Do I have a scent?
Dungeon Master 00:46:05 Yeah. Oh, and then, sorry, again, it's a single entity. So you don't have to cast a AoE effect. A single target spell would work on the group because it's one monster.
Cletus Cobbington 00:46:21 you
Leopold Magnus 00:46:29 Brian, does that have an effect on stone? I always remember it did something. Oh, it's not.
Kaladen Shash 00:46:34 Actually, yeah. Shatter does. Can I capture the big guy? That's even better. That's a great idea. We'll just have advantage. Is that right? Does it do double? Oh, it's not actual. It's just some spider. That's fine. I'm just trying to kill as much of that thing or
Cyrus Schwert 00:46:35 It's a living stone.
Dungeon Master 00:46:48 It's not actually made of stone. It just got something called false appearance. When it's not moving, it cannot be detected. Yeah, I mean, if you can get both. Can you get both or just one?
Kaladen Shash 00:47:04 Yeah, let me go ahead and cast this on the big guy. Maybe it'll stun it or whatever. It's a constitution save. Maybe I can get both. It's a 10-foot radius. You have to measure. I can get both. Yeah, I'll just sculpt it around him. It'll be a con save.
Dungeon Master 00:47:24 Yeah, you could just get both if you put it right on Leopold and then exclude him. The asteroid spider has a 24. Spider. Spider.
Leopold Magnus 00:47:33 That's got to be trippy.
Kaladen Shash 00:47:35 16. That'll absolutely save. Oh, roll really soft, roll really soft. Perfect. So they all, the swarm thing fails, but that was a really soft roll. It's disappointing. Yep. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:47:40 Asteroid Fighter. Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:47:46 And the swarm of spiders, oh, sorry, let the deck save this minus one. It's just 15. Would you get 13? Oh, finish them. I was about to add them to the initiative counter, but they're dead.
Kaladen Shash 00:48:11 um i will can i hold my movement and if i don't need to do anything use it at the end of the round is that a thing holding movement instead of holding action because i used an action a spell okay that was my spell was in action so
Cyrus Schwert 00:48:12 Let's go.
Dungeon Master 00:48:23 Well, you can't hold movement, but you can hold an action for a dash. Right, yeah. So it'd be move now if you have it.
Cletus Cobbington 00:48:24 I'm
Kaladen Shash 00:48:42 All right, that's fine. I want to move now, but that's going to be a huge gap. The uphold's going to have to disengage and action dash dash something. All right, I'll go ahead and use my feet. My feet's going to select. Cool. End of turn.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:55 I got it. I got it. I'm gonna get out of here.
Dungeon Master 00:49:06 OK, after that, Cyrus, it is your turn. 21 saves. You don't get stuck. And then as an update, what is your guys' total distance so far?
Cyrus Schwert 00:49:13 Okay. A 21 on the next day. I'm sending it about as hard as possible. Cyrus is huffing and puffing. He's going to blow the house down. Screwed.
Cletus Cobbington 00:49:21 80 for me.
Leopold Magnus 00:49:40 40 for me.
Kaladen Shash 00:49:40 Let me get the ruler. Yeah, I'm way out there. I'm like, yeah, 160-ish, 150. I can't stretch. But I also got to misty step inside of that as far as movement, too. So that first round was a big movement.
Cyrus Schwert 00:49:42 I would be at 160. Yeah, 160. I'm taking too far.
Dungeon Master 00:50:01 Okay, both of you at 160. Zario, what is your total at? Okay. Cool. After that, Cletus, your go.
Zariel Torgan 00:50:08 125. I must have started a little further on the map forward because I should just be at 120.
Cyrus Schwert 00:50:13 That Cyrus.
Cletus Cobbington 00:50:19 all right um i'm gonna cast uh conjure animals and i'm gonna conjure eight giant wolf spiders gonna add some more spideys but on our side this time
Kaladen Shash 00:50:44 Yes.
Dungeon Master 00:50:47 Are you kidding me right now?
Leopold Magnus 00:50:47 the good ones.
Zariel Torgan 00:50:51 Have them put in a good word. That's brilliant.
Cletus Cobbington 00:50:51 And I do this because they have Spider Climb, can climb difficult surface. Web Sense, they can locate the exact location of any creature in contact with the same web. And they have Web Walker, which ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing. So they don't need any deck saves. You can make them look like the Rizzler. They're spiders with the Rizzler's head.
Cyrus Schwert 00:51:00 The worst. You're making Jonathan keep track of which part of the earth. There's. It's just horrid.
Dungeon Master 00:51:22 That's haunting. Let's see, I can always show their name. Their name is Cletusis spiders.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:23 That's worse.
Cletus Cobbington 00:51:25 like those crazy things from Spy Kids. Gross scorpion dudes.
Dungeon Master 00:51:50 Okay, where the fuck do you want them? I'm gonna rule it right here. They gotta stay as a group. We're not doing one here, one there.
Cletus Cobbington 00:51:52 Let me keep three of them. Or wait, oops, that's. OK, that's fair. That's fair. Let's group. Can you form them into a circle that stays like a pod so you don't have to drag all of them? Just make just.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:05 They all have their own names.
Kaladen Shash 00:52:07 I love this. Each one has their own initiative. No, no, no. You know how this works.
Dungeon Master 00:52:17 Yeah, I can always have them group. Like they move around. Yes, master.
Cletus Cobbington 00:52:22 Put them in like a square circle, I guess. That's fine. Thank you. That's fine. Just, I don't know. Have them surround me. Yes, my spider babies. Tell me if
Dungeon Master 00:52:46 Okay. Give me one thing. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:52:50 nasty ones are approaching. And I guess I need my dex save, right? OK, with advantage, thankfully. OK, horrible. Epic. Spiders, protect me.
Cletus Cobbington 00:53:19 This is the punishment for spawning more spiders for you. I am stuck, for sure. Yeah, that's only a d4, though. Max, give me a 9. Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:53:24 You have blessed, right? It's not going to help. You are a group of spiders. OK, you are stuck. So you used your action to conjure them, correct?
Cyrus Schwert 00:53:24 Did you roll your blasts?
Dungeon Master 00:53:49 okay so there is this is the first time it came to effect i'll explain it once you guys get stuck your movement is zero until you change that you can spend an action to force yourself out and there will be a couple ways that it manifests it's a d4 roll instead of anything else um but you just like let me know how you want to approach it and there's like certain things happen so since you don't have an action you're just stuck do you have anything with your bonus action
Cletus Cobbington 00:54:11 Okay. Ah! Glad to be the guinea pig, guys. You know... Hmm. No, don't think so. I mean, I guess, yeah. Shillelagh my staff. Prepare for the worst. That's it.
Dungeon Master 00:54:39 After that, Leopold. Unless one of them is a cantrip. Okay. Good plan.
Leopold Magnus 00:54:42 Okay, so I guess I was just realizing that I can't necessarily cast two spells, one action, one bonus action. Like, could I cast Misty Step and then... Got it. Yeah, so I will cast Misty Step as a bonus action. And...
Zariel Torgan 00:54:44 Thanks.
Cletus Cobbington 00:54:47 you you
Kaladen Shash 00:54:50 Right.
Leopold Magnus 00:55:10 That's a range of 30 feet. Okay. Yeah. Yes. I guess I'd have to move, like... Actually, I wouldn't be able to clear them. I'd only be right behind them. Eh...
Dungeon Master 00:55:15 It's 40 feet or something, 30 feet. Get you out of range of those spiders. You can.
Leopold Magnus 00:55:38 Damn, I thought I could have misty-stepped away. Actually, I can. I can get past them. Mm-hmm. Like, basically right in the heart of him, like right here.
Dungeon Master 00:55:47 Missy's step is 30 feet. Yeah, 30 feet takes you into Cletus's swarm of spiders. Yeah, I mean, a little bit farther back. I don't know if you've got the measure while dragging thing, but it puts you like .
Kaladen Shash 00:55:49 Yep.
Leopold Magnus 00:56:07 Oh, yeah, I see. Okay. Yeah, so I'll do that, and then as an action, I will dash, and I'll just run through these spiders, taking the attack of opportunity. But I'll be able to... Oh! Okay, good, good. God, I was getting fucking confused. 60 feet. Yeah, I was like, God damn, am I going to have to run through these fucking things?
Dungeon Master 00:56:18 Again, those are Cletus's spiders, so they're not going to attack you. It's kind of insane that you would do that, but sure. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:56:20 Those are mine. I've made it extremely confusing by adding more spiders. Can they all have the fedoras to tip their hats so everyone knows?
Kaladen Shash 00:56:23 Oh.
Zariel Torgan 00:56:35 It really makes this encounter easier.
Leopold Magnus 00:56:40 And then I guess actually I have to make, is it the start or the end of your turn to make the check? Okay, cool. Yeah, then I just cleared another 60 feet up by Zariel. And that was my turn.
Dungeon Master 00:56:47 You bonus action Misty Step, so even if you failed your check, you instantly teleport out anyway, so you're fine. Cool. Start of the round. Zariel is your go. Oh, Dexterity save and throw?
Cyrus Schwert 00:57:01 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:18 Oh, yeah, okay. That would be funny if it didn't work. I got a whole plan here. 17? Alright. I'd like to run back 35 feet to Cletus and touch him and cast Freedom of the Winds at 5th level. And then...
Dungeon Master 00:57:29 17 passes. You can just tell me about it.
Cletus Cobbington 00:57:48 freedom of the winds wow Jesus
Zariel Torgan 00:57:49 Do you want to look that up, or do you want me to tell you about it? All right, yeah. So you gain a fly speed of 60 feet. You have advantage on ability checks to avoid being grappled and on saving throws against being restrained or paralyzed. And then when you're targeted by a spell or an attack, while in this effect, you can use your reaction to teleport up to 60 feet away in an unoccupied space that you can see.
Dungeon Master 00:58:17 Nice. Beautiful. OK. Nicely done. You got way higher movement when you're in that form, so that's nice. OK. Initiative account 20.
Leopold Magnus 00:58:17 Nice.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:19 So and with my bonus action, I'm going to use both of my wild shapes to go into my fire elemental form. And with that, that's my full turn.
Cletus Cobbington 00:58:21 Never felt lighter in my life.
Dungeon Master 00:58:48 We get some more baddies. On a nine, you guys see... Give me a second. The farthest person back is currently Thedas and Zaryl, so they pop up there. You see...
Cletus Cobbington 00:58:51 is that
Dungeon Master 00:59:14 uh three of these sort of translucent blue and whitish um kind of alien looking spiders like of a different breed um these are phase spiders see when they go they go next nice
Cletus Cobbington 00:59:28 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:59:29 Damn. Not looking good.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:41 Ouch.
Dungeon Master 00:59:45 And it's three fave spiders and then one wolf spider. OK.
Kaladen Shash 00:59:56 The big, okay. Ooh, I start rumbling.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:03 Good thing we have good guys, spiders. Holy shit.
Dungeon Master 01:00:07 Also on initiative count 20 is this large little rockish spider, the asteroid spider. It's got 40 feet of movement. I will actually maybe cause it's so big. It's got, it's got 60 feet. It runs forward and it'll, because I mean, I'm not going to, you, you put a lot of effort into it. It'll take,
Cletus Cobbington 01:00:07 Damn. Fucking hell.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:25 God damn. Jesus.
Dungeon Master 01:00:34 Of its two attacks with its things, it'll go for two of your fake spiders to it. 26 on the first one. Wasting it. Wasting it on other ones. And then a natural 20 on the other one. Uh...
Cletus Cobbington 01:00:41 Hey, they're just as real as you, guy. Doesn't hit, no. Oh, Jesus. No, they're fedoras.
Kaladen Shash 01:00:44 That'll do it. That'll do it.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:56 This fedora is gone.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:59 They're fedorous. Thank God. Oh my God.
Dungeon Master 01:01:02 I don't know how much each one of yours has, but it takes 21 piercing damage and 10 acid damage. And then the crit will do double that. So are they alive, the two that it hits? OK, those are gone. But then it's going to use its web strand against you, not knowing that you have this benefit. So that is a 28 to hit. But it is to grapple you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:01:16 Sure. Advantage on ability checks to avoid being grappled.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:17 30.
Dungeon Master 01:01:31 Can you be grappled, or do you have something that just makes you get out of being grappled? This is an attack, so you are just grappled. But if you get hit with an attack, you can use your reaction to move, right? So you can do that if you would like, but you would be leaving your spiders behind.
Zariel Torgan 01:01:40 Yeah. Yeah, up to 60 feet teleport.
Cletus Cobbington 01:01:51 Oh, yeah. I'm tipping... Yeah, I'm tipping my fedora and peacing out. Thanks, Ariel. Thanks, Ariel. Teleport 60 feet away. Sorry. Jesus, that's so funny.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:58 sacrificial back
Cyrus Schwert 01:02:01 How did the spiders?
Leopold Magnus 01:02:06 Whatever happened to no man left behind?
Dungeon Master 01:02:13 Okay, go ahead and move yourself 60 feet up. After that will be the three phase spiders who are going to move in to the closest one, which is Zariel.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:15 Bye.
Cletus Cobbington 01:02:21 These guys are really good at call duty. They're in phase. Sorry. I'm going to apologize for that one. Sorry.
Cyrus Schwert 01:02:35 you
Dungeon Master 01:02:45 I think he just gets one hit each of them. So the first one is a seven to hit. The second spider has a 23 to hit. And the last one rolls a six.
Cletus Cobbington 01:02:54 Oh, misses. That does, in fact, hit. Misses.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:56 Yes. It's. Miss. So both of them that moved him on to my space, take a detent of fire damage. I'm going to roll that twice. Oh, gotcha. All right.
Kaladen Shash 01:03:10 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:03:16 I mean, all three of them moved into your space. They're going for you.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:23 So however you want to split this up. Or I guess we could have just took the first one three times. However you want to do it. And then the two that actually hit are going to take my fire shield damage, which is 2d8. Let me just find it real quick. So that's 16 fire damage on the first and five on the second.
Leopold Magnus 01:03:37 Jeez.
Cyrus Schwert 01:03:40 Damn. Still two eights. Wow.
Cletus Cobbington 01:03:44 Nice.
Kaladen Shash 01:03:45 Yeah, has to be.
Dungeon Master 01:03:51 Okay, so seven, eight, then three, and then I do math now. Two that hit take 16. And then it's just you. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:11 Yeah, I've been misreading fire shield. I thought it was a floating flaming shield, but it's just like wrapping around your body, just like, yeah. And so now I'm with a fire shield.
Kaladen Shash 01:04:20 Yeah, right next to you.
Dungeon Master 01:04:22 They're all still up, but that does look considerable. And after that, it is Kaladin's go. You got it. Oh, right. Wait. What's your AC?
Cletus Cobbington 01:04:34 Real quick, I forgot to roll initiative for my Spideys. I just rolled a nine for them. They can just go last.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:41 Also, you didn't give me any damage for those hits. 13. Two of them hit. Oh, one of them hit. Sorry. One hit, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:04:55 I got a 7, 23, and 6, so only one hit. That is 1d10 plus 2 piercing damage, so you take 9 piercing damage and give me a constitution saving throw.
Kaladen Shash 01:05:02 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:03 Fucking slacking Craig.
Zariel Torgan 01:05:06 Heh heh heh heh.
Dungeon Master 01:05:06 the fuck, dude? I complimented you. It was busy. You got it. Oh, Trace, go ahead and tell me what your spiders do, too. They'll just move simultaneously.
Kaladen Shash 01:05:08 He was fucking. What are you going to do? Do I need to make a deck save at the top of the turn? Is that what's happening? No. Where is that? There it is.
Cyrus Schwert 01:05:08 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:05:35 Okay, I don't want to... Let's have them attack the phase spiders. We'll focus... We got two attacks. Wait, they have two attacks each? Let's do it.
Kaladen Shash 01:05:41 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:05:45 Okay, go ahead and roll six attacks. You do two on each spider. Yeah, that's annoying. Just go ahead and roll it. I mean, roll it as two attacks each. You've got six, so you've got 12 attacks.
Cletus Cobbington 01:06:08 How many do I even have? Five? Six? Six. Jesus Christ. And then they have plus three to hit. Jesus. Wait. Oh, I did damage. Fuck.
Cyrus Schwert 01:06:17 Yeah, perfect.
Dungeon Master 01:06:18 We're not doing that. You just rolled damage, Trace. 57 damage.
Zariel Torgan 01:06:20 Depending on who they're hitting, they might get advantage too. Just to make it more complicated. Okay, that's fair. Flawless.
Kaladen Shash 01:06:26 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:06:40 my bad we're uh here we go supposed to be plus three okay one two
Leopold Magnus 01:06:48 um,
Dungeon Master 01:06:50 Okay, let me look at their AC real quick and just go through the list. AC is 13. So first one misses, second one misses, third one misses. And then I think that 15 plus three hits. So you got one attack on the first spider. Second spider takes two hits. Third spider, Jesus. It's not 20. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:07:13 There's a nat 20 in there. OK. OK, two hits. Wait. OK. OK, six.
Dungeon Master 01:07:18 That's two more hits, and then two more hits. Each spider takes two hits. We'll just call it that. And crit one of the damage, although they don't have a ton of health. Depending how much you do, you might just finish them.
Cletus Cobbington 01:07:44 But 7, because 1 crit. That sounds right. Plus 1. And then you need to take constitution statement there as well.
Kaladen Shash 01:07:48 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:07:59 it doesn't matter I just pulled their health together to make it easier and that's more than the combined remaining health so your spider swarm swarms the phase spiders and none of them use their turn to disappear so they're all right there and they just get destroyed
Zariel Torgan 01:08:02 Jesus Christ. Boo.
Cletus Cobbington 01:08:19 Fuck you, FaZe. Green wall. Green wall. All right. That's for Travis. I'm going to keep him there to protect Zaryl for potentialness.
Cyrus Schwert 01:08:27 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:08:30 After and then it's also Calvin's turn. Cool.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:39 And I rolled a concentration check on that damage, by the way. I got like a 13 or a 15.
Kaladen Shash 01:08:48 I'll use my bonus action to cast a Soptric Blast at the big spider. I'll cast all three. I don't think the first one's going to hit 12. I'll do a 12. I'll do a plus d4 to the 12 because it's an attack roll, right? How about 15? Darn. All right.
Cletus Cobbington 01:08:58 Chonky spider.
Dungeon Master 01:09:02 12 misses 15 misses it's big
Kaladen Shash 01:09:21 I got it absolutely bombed it, so that's all right. Just one, just one. Just keep poking it. Eight force damage. Yeah. All move. Yeah. All move forward 40 feet.
Zariel Torgan 01:09:21 Eight's not bad.
Dungeon Master 01:09:34 A little bit of view of smoke kind of comes off of its shoulder. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:09:52 with my movement. And then I'll hold my action to dash or just wait. I'm probably just going to end up waiting.
Dungeon Master 01:10:06 After your turn, it is this wolf spider that is not Cletus's. It's got 40 feet of movement. It's going to just move forward 40 feet there, and it'll dash along the tree line and get to there.
Cletus Cobbington 01:10:14 fedora-less spider.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:16 He probably wants to be, though.
Dungeon Master 01:10:27 Technically, at one point on the ceiling, having the spider climb just makes it go everywhere. It sets itself up to take you out as you pass by, but that's its full turn. Then it is Cyrus.
Cyrus Schwert 01:10:42 Perfect, perfect. I'll roll my save. It's rolling very slowly, but here it comes. It's noted. Let's go. I'm just going to keep on hauling ass. Everybody seems to be doing pretty well for the most part.
Dungeon Master 01:10:57 27 passes, obviously, because that's 35.
Cyrus Schwert 01:11:14 Just move my feet. I do not have bonus actions. That would make sense. There I am. I've just been sprinting as fast as I can while people are fucking with spiders. I said I liked spiders, but I might have lied a little. I'm a little scared. I like them, but they're just big and weird.
Dungeon Master 01:11:31 Hold tight. Cletus, it's your go.
Kaladen Shash 01:11:38 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:38 You lied to me.
Cyrus Schwert 01:11:46 I like what they do.
Cletus Cobbington 01:11:49 real quick clarifying question um freedom of the ones gives me 60 feet fly does that stack with long strider for 70 or does that just overwrite it to 60. oh that's a good call yeah i think so uh yeah it says speed increases 10 feet okay cool
Dungeon Master 01:11:58 Long Strider, just as it gives you 10 more feet of movement, it doesn't specify 10 more walking speed. Because unless it specifically says walking speed, you just got extra movement. Cool. You've got 70 feet fly. I still give me an acrobatics check instead, which might be better than your deck save.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:16 Plus you're blessed, right?
Cletus Cobbington 01:12:19 It's the same, but fuck it. And I have advantage on dex still, right? Or does acrobatic dex still count? OK, cool.
Dungeon Master 01:12:28 It might be the same, but... It's still DC-12, so you're fine. Flying, you find that it's less on the ground, but you're flying down and up and to the side as you were avoiding these various web strands and spiders that are jumping out at you.
Kaladen Shash 01:12:32 Well, on your save, you still get a d4. That should be all right. Yeah. You still have advantage on dex.
Cletus Cobbington 01:12:54 Sure. Before I start moving, I'm going to shoot out a sacred flame at this spire that's on the . Yeah. That'd be a dex save. 16.
Dungeon Master 01:13:08 Donuts up here. Cool. Dex save of 16. That is a dirty 20, not 17. Is it a cantrip? I think it's nothing. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:13:26 Okay, so half to him and try. Or does it just miss? Yeah, can't trip, so it just misses. Nope. Well, that was a waste. Fuck you. I'm just going to fly by. If it takes an attack, fuck it.
Kaladen Shash 01:13:37 Unless you have potent cantrip. I don't know if that's a thing.
Dungeon Master 01:13:39 This is the spider from earlier. The spider nodded at Cyrus and you see it looks at you too and it also does the thing and it ducks. Sees it coming. It'll take its attack opportunity. You're just as good of a target.
Cletus Cobbington 01:13:59 And that's just how I get that reaction every turn. I get that reaction every turn.
Kaladen Shash 01:14:07 Does. Mississippi.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:07 You could use your reaction now, if you wanted to, to go another 60 feet. Now it's targeted. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:14:12 If it hits though, right? Then 18, that probably hit. You get your reaction back on your turn. So the other one happened in between your turns, and then it's your turn again, so you have your reaction again. 18 to hit. Okay, and then does the target still take damage, Jesse?
Cletus Cobbington 01:14:33 We'll teleport. Might as well. Oh, yeah. Targeted by Speller attack. All this effect. Damn. That's awesome. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:40 No, it says targeted, whenever you're targeted with an attack, not when you're hit. So you don't even have to hit. It's pretty crazy. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:14:48 Nice. That's pretty good fifth level spells. No joke. OK, you just move up instead. Go ahead and move yourself the extra 60 feet. Top of the round, it is Zario. You are surrounded by all of Cletus's spiders and this giant asteroid spider. To that point, everything within a certain space of you takes fire damage, right?
Zariel Torgan 01:15:13 Yeah, 1d10. So I'll roll it for his spiders. Oh, yeah. Yep. Okay. Just to warm. I'm keeping them toasty.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:15 Hey, John. Wouldn't it be me next? Because there's Cletus, right? Oh. Oh, no. I don't know.
Dungeon Master 01:15:18 Yeah. Oh, it is Leopold. Anyway, Zoro, go ahead and roll the damage for the spiders anyway. Well, he does that. Just so we get that going. You summoned eight spiders into a spider combat encounter. You deserve this. Okay, Leopold, you're done.
Kaladen Shash 01:15:23 I mean, we're
Cletus Cobbington 01:15:31 You burning my Spidey's? No.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:44 Take one damage. I.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:46 Okay. Yeah, I was just making sure. Okay, so for my action, I'm going to bend down and I guess kind of look around, checking behind me, seeing all the spiders. I'm going to cast Expeditious Retreat and drop the Wind Ward. And what you'll see is...
Leopold Magnus 01:16:13 at camp in my free time I've been working up some roller skate wheels and you kind of shoot off my ankles and I'm on wheels and then all of a sudden these rockets kind of start to sputter and fire and you just see this gigantic blast of rocket fuel coming out of my ankles and I just skate off but um oh yeah I guess so um
Dungeon Master 01:16:35 Alrighty, before you do that really cool thing, give me a dexterity save to start the turn. I'm sorry you'll pass, but I just want to know. The order... Yes, because it's the start of the round is the dexterity save, so before you have a chance to do something, so you start the turn. Mm-hmm.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:39 Oh, no.
Kaladen Shash 01:16:42 Advantage, I think, and a D4. And a D4. And a D4.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:42 Well, could I do this? Drop the warding wind, I guess, after I pass the deck save. I guess, or it's like mechanic. Okay, so at least this one would have a bit of a lower DC. And then I have advantage from someone. And a D4, cool.
Cletus Cobbington 01:16:53 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:17:09 Yes, I do. It's,
Zariel Torgan 01:17:10 Yeah, plus blast.
Leopold Magnus 01:17:15 Oh, I think I was going to need it. Yep. 12 is a DC, right? Oh, cool. Okay. 15. Nice and well. So yeah, then I'll cast that Expeditious Retreat. Yeah, so it says you take the dash action and until the spell ends, I can take it.
Dungeon Master 01:17:19 But it's 10 since it's a little bit lower. Easy pass. Okay. Then you do all that cool stuff. So you've got freedom of movement. Oh, sorry. Yes. Expeditious retreat, which is a bonus action dash. Correct. So you have movement dash bonus action.
Leopold Magnus 01:17:42 again as a bonus action so i think i'd basically get two dash actions this turn right cool and so then that would be is it so i was going to say yeah because it doubles your movement right so i have 30 so i would double to 60 then i double again to 120 is that how that works cool excellent um
Dungeon Master 01:17:49 Mm hmm. Yeah, 40 to 80. And then year. And then
Kaladen Shash 01:17:49 Yeah. Move dash dash. 120 feet. You're at 40 feet. 120. 120.
Cyrus Schwert 01:17:52 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:13 Oh, right. No, so then it would be 160 because I'm at 40, right? 40, 81. All right, so my speed is 30, but I have a 10-foot extra because of the long strider. A 40, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:18:18 One of them is doubled again. So it's 40, 80, 120. Because the dash action isn't your whole speed doubled again. Your speed is 40. Yeah, so 40 to 80 to 120. And then on the next turns, when you move dash, dash, oh, it's the same.
Kaladen Shash 01:18:25 That's it. Double distance, you just get to do it twice. Just to send.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:48 Got it. So it doesn't double the double. It just is an additive, right? Got it. Okay, that's how you get to 120, not 180. Okay. Oh, well, it says here that you gain, you take the dash action.
Dungeon Master 01:18:49 Yeah. You're just talking 120 the whole time. Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:54 Yeah. Yeah, because I think you only get 80 this time because you had to cast it this time. So it's either an action or a bonus. So you'll only move 80 this time, 120 every subsequent turn unless you were to do something different.
Kaladen Shash 01:19:04 That's that's exactly right. There we go. What was. Well, no, so that it has. It's got action economy.
Cyrus Schwert 01:19:08 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:19:16 And until the spell ends, you can take that action as a bonus action. So then is casting Expeditious Retreat, like that is taking a dash action as well? So I would get the dash, then I could use it as a bonus? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:19:25 Yeah, it's casting a spell and getting the movement. So what is it? It casts an action to cast it initially, right? So you have 40 feet. You use your action to cast the spell, so you get 40 feet right then. So you're at 80 feet, and then you have bonus action that you can use on subsequent turns to dash. So you clock at 80 the first round, and then you've got 120 going forward if you only move...
Zariel Torgan 01:19:30 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:19:37 Bonus action plus movement.
Leopold Magnus 01:19:56 I would still catch me up to the group, so I'll go blasting on by. Yeah, you just see me. I'm kind of now balancing on one skate like they do down at the roller derby, and I've got my
Dungeon Master 01:20:00 And since you're not a rogue, you don't just have bonus action dash. So you don't just have that you can do every round. Yeah, it's still plenty of movement.
Kaladen Shash 01:20:16 80 feet there you go.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:28 butt and I go blast you on by and I'll say you guys better get on out of here yeah I'm bouncing I'm the clearance is low yeah this is it turns into Apollo oh no speed skating eventually and that's my turn
Zariel Torgan 01:20:31 Like they do at the. Better be. All right.
Dungeon Master 01:20:32 Sure. He's got... He's got, like, flip-striking tabs. He's like a low-riding car. Okay, then... Then it is Zaryl's turn.
Cletus Cobbington 01:20:38 Is your ass making sparks on the ground as you fly by? Shit, you started another fire with your ass.
Cyrus Schwert 01:20:39 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:20:51 No.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:01 Long Strider works whatever form you're in, right? Alright, so I have 60 feet regular movement, 120 feet total if I use my action to dash, which I will do so. So...
Dungeon Master 01:21:06 you'll take one attack of opportunity from the astrate spider who has a 10 foot reach so he'll get one attack on you as you go and then he'll take the fire damage that you rolled the one point but still a hit
Cletus Cobbington 01:21:33 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:21:35 Fire elemental has a 28 to hit. And you take 17 piercing, 5 poison. You take 22 points of damage total.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:39 Yeah, that hits for sure. All right, he takes 11. And then I'll roll concentration. All right.
Kaladen Shash 01:21:45 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:15 Alright, yeah, I maintain concentration. That's full. Was he close enough and flammable or not?
Dungeon Master 01:22:17 yeah um okay and then you move very far after that anything else on your turn or is that full full action economy do you are you asking is he classified as flammable for fire
Cletus Cobbington 01:22:18 Woo.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:43 Oh, he's a stone, never mind. Yeah, yeah, any creature that doesn't use an action to put itself out is ignited. All right, so he'll just take an additional d10 on his turn, which I think is next.
Dungeon Master 01:22:47 Well, no, he's not mechanically a stone. Does he catch fire if he hits you? Doesn't say that he is immune to fire or anything, so he catches fire. Yes.
Cletus Cobbington 01:22:48 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:23:08 Although if we're being all above board, technically, I think the spiders also are going to expire. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:23:17 haven't gone yet they're technically next also there's a lot going on because they take damage on this turn that's what you rolled for already so they will take one point of damage to start the turn and then catch fire well they're about to because uh after your turn i'll roll another d12
Cletus Cobbington 01:23:20 fedoras are currently singed for sure soon to be not it's fine they did their job if they burn they burn
Dungeon Master 01:23:43 But then the Astrid Spider is going to bolt it for you guys. That was almost a 12. That's a 3. You see... Where's the... Of the player characters, who's the farthest back? Is it... Zariel again? Zariel...
Cletus Cobbington 01:24:03 Think so. Jesus.
Kaladen Shash 01:24:03 Yeah, still.
Dungeon Master 01:24:10 what you thought was another regular stone popping up right next to you as you were flying by, another huge spider breaks out of the ground ready to get you. And he will go... Initiative count 17. Initiative count 10. Not 17. Okay. And then the swarm of spiders...
Zariel Torgan 01:24:24 Right.
Dungeon Master 01:24:40 is still there. There's a lot of stuff here, guys. Oh, and also because they're all rolling higher initiative than you. OK, first asteroid spider is going to take six opportunity attacks to move forward. And then to dash takes it, right?
Cletus Cobbington 01:25:06 They took, or my spy just got opportunity attacks, right? That's what's happening. I got a crit.
Dungeon Master 01:25:11 Yeah, as it... Okay, anything over 17 hits. So the 19, the 20...
Kaladen Shash 01:25:16 Just stay in front of these guys. They've got 80 feet of movement. Yeah, you're a Scott. You're a Scott. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:25:35 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:25:39 No, no, no, they're not.
Dungeon Master 01:25:40 It's a 14 plus three, right? So the 14 hits and then the rest miss. You've got three hits. One is a crit. Are the spiders blessed?
Kaladen Shash 01:25:46 D4 and you put a d4 on one that's close Oh, oh, no, I guess not sorry, sorry, I was thinking of him I was thinking of him not the spiders
Zariel Torgan 01:25:55 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:26:12 16 damage. I guess he takes one constitution saving throw if they get bit. Just do one for him. It doesn't matter. He beats it.
Dungeon Master 01:26:12 16 damage. Okay. Yeah, he'll do a con save. Oh, 14. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:26:38 Um, okay. After his go, it'll be the swarm of insects, which is so far behind. I think it can get to your spiders, but it's just going to keep moving. It's going to be irrelevant. After that is Cletus's spiders. Yeah. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:27:00 uh they're all hella on fire now does that just what does fire do it takes damage like end of their turn or something and that means they won't be able to attack correct
Dungeon Master 01:27:11 Take a D10 at the start. Your spiders can stop, drop, and roll and put it out. Yes. They attack the...
Zariel Torgan 01:27:15 I think it's at the end if they don't use an action to put it out. I think it's meant to just... They should be able to do fire damage.
Kaladen Shash 01:27:29 Yeah, that'll be the action. Light him on fire.
Cletus Cobbington 01:27:31 bucket they're just gonna attack this other spider that's right in front of them i have wait do i still have six spiders there 12 d6 okay oh d20s i almost did it again
Dungeon Master 01:27:38 The spiders attack the swarm of spiders. Go for it. You're going for AC 12. This is too much. Yeah. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:28:00 OK, another crit. God damn it. When you roll this many, I guess it happens. What did they have to be? Maybe plus 1 or plus 3 to these. Oh shit, really? Oh shit. Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:28:09 One, two, three, crit. Miss, miss, hit. You crit twice. You have seven hits. With two of them are crit. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:28:30 with two crits, so nine, right? Yes, fighters. Your fedoras didn't burn in vain.
Kaladen Shash 01:28:33 Yeah, five normal up to nine. We roll it. Not unless they want to move and then you can burn them.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:43 Nice. Damn. We don't roll that fire damage. Oh, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:28:45 easily finishes them. Do they move?
Cletus Cobbington 01:29:04 uh yeah i guess let's move them 40 feet that's their movement that gets them like almost to that other one and then they burn they're still alive three three hp a piece
Dungeon Master 01:29:17 Which fire damage did it take? 1, 2, 10. Oh, shit. It helped 9 fire damage. After that is the second Asteroid Spider. It is going to use its movement, and it's going to pass through all of your spaces to get in front of you. And then it will take its attacks
Zariel Torgan 01:29:20 damn damn
Kaladen Shash 01:29:21 Ooh, heavy. There you go. Live for another round. Go pastor people.
Cyrus Schwert 01:29:33 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:29:45 on Cletus in the front. So everybody can take an attack of opportunity if you would like. All right.
Cletus Cobbington 01:29:51 I mean, why wouldn't we, right? 28.
Kaladen Shash 01:29:52 I got a 22 or 21 to hit out of the three to that 18. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:30:07 Great is for all the good.
Dungeon Master 01:30:16 21 hit. 28 from Cletus hits. Sariel misses. Cyrus hits. Anybody? 17. 17 is what you guys are going for.
Zariel Torgan 01:30:27 Yeah not good.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:31 I think I'm going to hold my reaction.
Cletus Cobbington 01:30:32 Big six damage for me.
Kaladen Shash 01:30:40 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:30:43 Okay, 18, 13, 31, 7 is 38. Is that 38 damage total? All right. It takes this damage. You guys are lobbing off thick chunks of its exoskeleton, but it's got so much of it. Almost seems unfazed. As it gets to the front, I had rolled that is...
Cyrus Schwert 01:30:44 Oh, it works.
Dungeon Master 01:31:14 It was a 19 and a 24 to hit Pletus. OK. Nice. Yeah? So you teleport on the first one, right?
Cletus Cobbington 01:31:16 Yep, they both hit it. Wait. Concentration's still up. I'm going to teleport. Right? I think this will do that. Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 01:31:18 That's why you're walking.
Kaladen Shash 01:31:39 Yes, 60 feet, go.
Dungeon Master 01:31:45 Okay, so you move out of its space. The second attack goes to Leopold. 24, does that hit your AC? You're going to shield. Perfect. Missed this. Its third thing, it'll do a web strand at vote.
Cyrus Schwert 01:31:47 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:31:52 You let me screw everyone over.
Zariel Torgan 01:31:59 Nice. Mart.
Leopold Magnus 01:31:59 it would but since i held my action i'm going to use it to sh or my reaction i'm going to use it to shield
Dungeon Master 01:32:13 Last one, Kaladin, give me a... Oh, it's hit to hit. I'll get back to you. Just a second. That is... Ooh. 22. Okay. Good use of your stuff. And then... Not start of the round. After that is Kaladin.
Cletus Cobbington 01:32:26 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 01:32:29 I'll shield. I'm going to mark that shield off.
Kaladen Shash 01:33:03 I'm going to move forward. I'm just going to go ahead. I'm going to misty step. I'll just misty step 30 feet. Use my movement and then dash 110 feet. Why?
Cyrus Schwert 01:33:04 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:24 web.
Dungeon Master 01:33:25 Okay. You'll take an attack of opportunity from it as you go by, but it's burning its reaction to do so. Oh, yeah, you absolutely could. You mean you don't want to just Misty Step right to it? I'm confused. Okay. Still got its reaction. You go forward.
Kaladen Shash 01:33:33 Can I just not walk forward? Misty, step past it. Keep walking forward. Am I right? Yeah. Oh, 110. Oh, well.
Cletus Cobbington 01:33:40 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:33:55 Go ahead and move yourself to 120. 110. And then it is this. This spider is going to attack you, Zariel. It'll take damage, though, correct?
Kaladen Shash 01:34:02 Let's miss this step first. 10 feet.
Zariel Torgan 01:34:17 Yeah, so it says the first time a creature enters my space, it takes fire damage. And if it can catch fire, it does. That's all subsequent. All right. All right, let me just get that part real quick.
Dungeon Master 01:34:30 Yeah, it doesn't care if it dies. It's just there to take you out. You'll take six plus nine. You take 15 points of damage total, and go ahead and roll your damage on it. Because you might just kill it.
Zariel Torgan 01:34:49 All right, 15. And then, yeah, it's going to do a d10. And then it's also going to do 2d8. This thing is really slow for some reason. There we go. So 15 damage total.
Dungeon Master 01:35:11 There's a lot happening on the map. You finish it off. Nicely done. Yeah, do the contract. Ooh, one of those is in that one. OK.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:19 My concentration. We're good. Yeah, that would have been bad.
Cletus Cobbington 01:35:35 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:35:37 uh, you finish it off just with like, it goes to attack you and it kind of incinerates after it makes its landing. Um, after that it is Cyrus. So it's the start of your turn. Um, as you are more than halfway through, you see a branch comes swinging out, sort of let go by all the commotion. Give me either a strength save or an acrobat strength. We'll do athletics check or acrobatics check. Keep them both checks.
Cyrus Schwert 01:36:05 Okay, okay. Can we have FedEx? I'm gonna try to jump. Go.
Dungeon Master 01:36:15 No, it's good. Again, still, it's still DC 12. This thing comes at you and you sort of shoulder it and push it off to the side, not losing out on your track. Yes. Cause he didn't spend his yet.
Cletus Cobbington 01:36:30 Oh, yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:36:37 Will it take an attack of opportunity if I run past this homie? OK. Or I'm going to run to him and try to hit him a couple times.
Dungeon Master 01:37:00 OK, so ignore that then. 12 missing. AC is 17. I don't think you can hit it. First one just misses.
Cyrus Schwert 01:37:06 Apologies. Nice. Hold on. I got blessed. Bill, right? Well, there you go. Okay. And then I try that again.
Kaladen Shash 01:37:17 Yeah. 16.
Cyrus Schwert 01:37:37 Perfect. Do I still have the almond? Do you want to use the almond this time? Or chance? Perfect.
Dungeon Master 01:37:37 19 head. Hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 01:37:44 Yeah. I never chose someone else to give it to. Would we like to? Sure. Swallow it. Digest it.
Kaladen Shash 01:37:53 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:38:05 The almond, which is so soggy in your mouth already, you need to give it a final little bit of pressure and it just breaks apart. There he is again. Oh.
Cyrus Schwert 01:38:07 So then I, I, I store up my almond energy. You can see my sweat starts getting a little milky and I play real hard and I defensive flourish as well.
Cletus Cobbington 01:38:14 And that's how we invented almond butter, folks. Gross. You break out in rash.
Cyrus Schwert 01:38:38 So this is all plus 15. So 36 damage to him. I rolled double the dice. I forgot how to do it. Do you just double the whole thing for next time?
Dungeon Master 01:38:44 36 damage. Is that doubled? Okay. You could do it either way. I like to roll extra dice instead, but you could do it however. Your modifier is plus
Cyrus Schwert 01:39:07 Yeah, I think it's more fun. 8, so times 2 is 16. So 36 total. And then my AC goes up to 7 until the end of my next turn. And I took the slasher feat a while ago. So I'm pretty sure. Let me find it if I can.
Dungeon Master 01:39:15 Precinct, though.
Cyrus Schwert 01:39:32 You reduce a creature's speed when you deal slashing damage. You also gain the ability to wound a creature on a critical hit. You grievously wound a creature on a critical hit until the start of your next turn. The target has disadvantage on all attack rolls. And I reduced its speed by 10 until the start of my next turn as well.
Dungeon Master 01:39:49 Nice. I'll put a modifier. No.
Cletus Cobbington 01:39:59 Nice. Fuck that spider. Is that spider allergic to nuts? But that's mostly just because it got slashed with a sword and not because the nuts, right?
Cyrus Schwert 01:40:03 He's grievously wounded from my splash. Yes, Google.
Kaladen Shash 01:40:10 No.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:10 Peace. Peace.
Dungeon Master 01:40:13 You see his throat, his spider throat swells a little bit, but it doesn't seem to do a whole lot. It's Kalita's turn. You don't know, actually. It's pretty convincing both ways.
Cletus Cobbington 01:40:30 Hmm, it gives me an idea. I mean, I feel like we want to just, I mean, do we want to just keep running or keep attacking this thing to try and kill at least one of them? OK, then.
Cyrus Schwert 01:40:52 I'm trying to slow it down and have disadvantage when the two people behind it ran by.
Zariel Torgan 01:40:53 How long?
Cletus Cobbington 01:41:00 Let's just fucking. Well, I get to actually, I'm going to cast, hit it with a Guiding Bolt before I run. Which is that? That's it. OK. First level. Oh, about to hit. 24 to hit.
Dungeon Master 01:41:31 24 hits. 15. And which one is this on? The one that Cyrus is fucking up?
Cletus Cobbington 01:41:35 15 damage. Can I reach? I guess I could reach both. Yeah, just the one that's right here. That's already getting hurt. And then I guess I have to do a deck save, don't I? I'm just freeing the ones.
Cyrus Schwert 01:41:45 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:42:01 Yeah. Well, this is an acrobatics or athletics. Your choice. Just save. No, you mean you have it on every single one. Go for it.
Cletus Cobbington 01:42:07 Hmm. They're both the same. Might as well do the Dex one so I can actually have advantage because I sure as hell fucking need it. Holy hell. I put my D4. Oh, wait, I didn't need to use that. Scratch that. That didn't happen. Oh, okay. Oh, Bless goes for every single one? Oh, fuck. I thought it was just one. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:42:28 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:42:33 Every saving throw, every attack roll. Not a bardic. It's good. You get a lot of use out of it.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:33 Yeah, Bless is awesome.
Cletus Cobbington 01:42:40 Well, when you roll low enough where it doesn't matter anyway, we don't use it. OK, now I get my 70. Thanks for holding concentrations, Aurel, your homie.
Dungeon Master 01:43:05 Doing a good job. Leopold, your go. I won't skip you this time.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:07 Ryan.
Cletus Cobbington 01:43:09 That spell is so good. I've never heard of that.
Cyrus Schwert 01:43:11 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:43:13 Oh dear, we better get out of here. And I'm just basically now in my total speed skating stance. Trying to stay low to minimize drag. And I will use my Expeditious Retreat to dash. And then use my bonus action to dash. So...
Dungeon Master 01:43:38 Okay, it will take an attack of opportunity on you, since it still hasn't done that, on your way back. Shield at the beginning of your next turn. You could always do it again.
Leopold Magnus 01:43:45 Now, I had used shield in the midst of its turn. Doesn't it last till the end of your turn or the beginning of your turn? Ah, okay. So, got it. So then that won't have any impact. Sure thing. But yeah, I'll scoot on by.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:59 Yeah, it's not stun. It's.
Kaladen Shash 01:44:01 Slasher. Slasher.
Dungeon Master 01:44:11 That is a dirty 30 to hit. He's got disadvantage. This virus is looking for you. 27 on the level number. Okay. Close.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:16 That connects, yeah. Why does he have disadvantage? Oh, because you slashed him. That's right. 27 doesn't help. Yeah, that connects.
Cyrus Schwert 01:44:17 with disadvantage. Come on. That'll do. Yeah, that'll do it.
Cletus Cobbington 01:44:32 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:44:37 Yeah, that'll do it. You take 19 piercing damage and 10 acid damage. But you have full movement, so you still get through.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:45 And acid damage who. Let's see, do I want to do something about that now? OK, so. Let's take 20. 29 damage or 39. Yeah, 29, sorry. Yep, and I'll blast on by.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:49 that for the years.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:16 An acid's in my visor, kind of going down my helm, trying to, like, spit it out. Hold on. So 120 would put me, like, amongst... Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:45:24 Okay, and then at the start of this next round, we're going to take a quick smoke break. As you guys are almost through this, we'll reconvene in like 10 or 15. 10, we'll call it 10.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:26 You ain't got no lips. Alright, sounds good.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:48 Basically, two more rounds until we get out of here. Although, Zariel and Cyrus are way behind. Yeah, we need to get out of here.
Cyrus Schwert 01:45:50 a little bit I also have freedom of movement back there so that I can cast on the way by if anybody else gets stuck or I can do it on myself so
Kaladen Shash 01:45:51 Yeah, where's... I feel like Zario could... He's got a couple tricks up his sleeve. He could shapeshift. Yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:46:18 Oh, nice. That's solid.
Kaladen Shash 01:46:20 Yeah, Cyrus, what is your... Are you just 40 feet with the buff now? Also, are you moving farther? Okay. Yeah, so, I mean, you could still get 120 on your next turn because the spider can only get 80. We just have to, like, keep... Just get out in front of it and just start moving.
Cyrus Schwert 01:46:27 Yeah. I'm not. It's just my normal speed's 30. Nothing crazy. Well, I lessen the spider speed, too, with the slashing thing. And
Leopold Magnus 01:46:48 it.
Kaladen Shash 01:46:55 For the turn. Oh, wow. That's pretty good, though, just in general. Like, that's nice.
Cyrus Schwert 01:46:57 That happens, yeah, that happens not just on crits, though. That's any time I hit anybody. So, like, I could keep kind of doing it, which is sick. Yeah, I don't think about it very often because, like, we're not usually in a chase encounter or anything, but that's any time I hit anybody. Yeah, it's cool.
Kaladen Shash 01:47:18 I don't usually look at fighter. I took my last what I think will be wizard one at Warcaster just so I could hold Bless if we get into fights and stuff. I'll just start looking at some of the fighter feats because I've never used them. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:47:28 Yeah. Yeah. I mean, all my stuff is like fighting and then support. So like I'm kind of made for things like this.
Leopold Magnus 01:47:48 Yeah, I'm going to start crafting magic items for the party here pretty soon. Once I get to the 10th level, I think. Yeah, I got to work on Chip's gun. And then, yeah, I think it won't be for a while. But once I hit 10th level artificer, I can craft uncommon items in the quarter amount of time it normally. No, like if you look at the uncommon magic item list, it's huge. Tons of stuff. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:47:54 Did you finish Chip's gun? It's really good. There's a lot of fun.
Cyrus Schwert 01:48:01 You craft balls.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:23 um like uh elven boots i was looking at those are those are pretty nice you don't have to attune to them yeah i think it gives you advantage on uh on stealth checks makes you move silently yeah um
Kaladen Shash 01:48:33 The elven boots just enhance stealth. Is that what that one is? Yeah. It'd be good for the old giant metal suits with felt socks on. Yeah, the hospital socks. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:48:35 That just gives you more speed or? Oh, that'd be good for you guys. For you and Cletus at least. There's a little grippy like socks that you get in the hospital.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:52 That's great. Yeah. Yeah, there's all sorts of interesting stuff that I can make, which will be fun. So I feel like, I mean, we had magic items last game, but what's that?
Kaladen Shash 01:49:07 oh this is I think this is the most this right this will be also the most diverse sort of party we've had which is right he's right but he also yeah and he also started out as a barbarian remember he was
Leopold Magnus 01:49:23 right yeah what did we play we had the monk and jonathan played the uh that bard kind of sword fighter and you were a caster that's right yeah yeah this is some items that look really helpful like there's this lantern that like sheds a light and uh invisible creatures will be as
Cyrus Schwert 01:49:29 No.
Kaladen Shash 01:49:39 yeah. yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:49:50 will be visible as long as the lantern is in bright light. Seems like that could come in handy, because you know how annoying it is when your enemies go invisible?
Kaladen Shash 01:50:03 Yeah, seeing visibility is a spell, but I don't know if anyone knows it. But yeah, then everyone would see it, I guess, if the lantern was working. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:50:10 Yeah, exactly. And then, you know, I could always tag them with a fairy fire or something and then, you know, it wouldn't, it wouldn't have to even, but, uh, there's lots of like useful little items that you wouldn't even really think of off the bat. That was, I was looking at kind of fun to play around with.
Kaladen Shash 01:50:38 That fits the bard stuff. All right. That's fun. That's pretty good. Is there a save on it? Is it just your spellcaster applied to it?
Cyrus Schwert 01:50:44 It's good.
Leopold Magnus 01:50:47 There's a set of wind instruments that will cause the enemy to be frightened. Yeah, it gets like three charges. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's your spellcast. Let's see. It's like haunted. Yeah, so let me read this.
Kaladen Shash 01:51:09 Was it users? Yours is pretty strong.
Leopold Magnus 01:51:18 I could just make these once per day because I can use them as infusions too. Proficient with wind instruments, which I am, I can play the squam, which is a medieval-like set of wind instruments. They sound awful.
Leopold Magnus 01:51:34 Anyways, it's three charges, and you use an action to play them and expend one charge to create an eerie spellbinding tune. Each creature in 30 feet has a, oh, I guess it's a DC 15. Yeah, that's lower than I would have thought. I thought it would have been my spellcaster, but yeah, if not, they're frightened. Yeah, anyone can use it, exactly.
Kaladen Shash 01:51:52 But anybody can use it. That's the benefit right there. That's right. It's like an auto pass once a day. It's your job. You've got good skills.
Leopold Magnus 01:51:59 Yeah, and it has three charges per day, and then you roll that D3, but I don't have to do any of that because as an artificer, you can just once per day create an infusion, which just gives you a free magic item. So I don't even have to worry about charges. Yeah, exactly.
Cyrus Schwert 01:52:14 My proficiencies for instruments that I chose for being a bard are clarinet and bird pipes. It's a little like, yeah, I think it's a little
Leopold Magnus 01:52:32 What is a bird pipe? That's funny. Piccolo. I just remember in
Kaladen Shash 01:52:37 It's like a little water flute.
Cyrus Schwert 01:52:44 like harmonica made of reeds kind of thing, where some of them are longer and some are shorter, if I'm not mistaken. No, it's like a little recorder or like a piccolo. There are many kinds.
Leopold Magnus 01:53:02 college there was a freshman year class called wind instruments and you would learn how to play or no it was Native American flute you'd learn how to play the Native American flute but everyone yeah you
Cyrus Schwert 01:53:13 Jonathan took that. It's one of the most popular classes at Oregon State. That's why. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. When I look up bird price, how do I
Leopold Magnus 01:53:18 Yeah, exactly. And everyone's always like, yeah, it's super easy. You don't really have to do anything. But God, I was going to fucking lose it the first like term in the dorms because everyone had it the same exact time. So you just hear the like, you know, 30 people playing a Native American flute and not really any of them very, very well either.
Kaladen Shash 01:53:18 okay
Cyrus Schwert 01:53:52 I'm sorry.
Dungeon Master 01:54:04 Native American flute is the shit. I still have mine. Saw it the other day. No, I forgot how. Luckily, I've got the book and stuff, but I didn't use it for anything outside of class. I practiced the bare minimum because it was an oral...
Leopold Magnus 01:54:10 I never did take it but oh really do you ever play it yeah
Kaladen Shash 01:54:25 Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:54:32 It was an oral tradition class, so there was no written anything. So there were no tests because you couldn't be quizzed. And there were so many people in the class that it would take the entire period or more to go through individual person playing music. So he would have groups play certain note sequences as if you were learning. But there were so many people you couldn't tell who didn't know how to do it. So it was...
Leopold Magnus 01:54:58 yeah that's exactly it that's why everyone always takes it you just get a totally free credit and you have to do one of those like for your um back core or whatever that's hilarious yeah it's that's like well known oregon state that's the that's the course
Dungeon Master 01:55:04 It was the definition of a blow-up club. Yeah. But Jan Michael Lookingwolf was a real homie. He was a professional rock flutist. You can look him up.
Cyrus Schwert 01:55:23 Picture that came up when I looked up bird pipes and it is the Rizzlers from the D&D books. So the Rizzlers, in fact, have bird pipes. Yes.
Leopold Magnus 01:55:31 I didn't know that. That's great. The Rizzlers play bird pipes. That's canon now. He looks offended that you got in the middle of him playing.
Kaladen Shash 01:55:40 Bye.
Cyrus Schwert 01:55:58 But I described it in the way that I wanted it to. The little reeds that are different lengths, and it sounds like a little harmonica, but with wind. A woodwind. Bird pipes. I chose my bar musical instrument proficiencies as bird pipes and clarinet.
Dungeon Master 01:56:10 It's very funny. Vega was lute and flute. I picked a flute. Well, I never put it together rhyming like that, but yeah, it was the lute and flute.
Leopold Magnus 01:56:11 That's awesome. The lute and flute.
Cyrus Schwert 01:56:31 here.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:35 We're...
Dungeon Master 01:56:43 And then he also knew drums from his background, I think. I think he played the guitar a couple times, but it was always just like an in-passing thing while I was letting other people do their stuff. He got everybody back, right?
Leopold Magnus 01:56:50 Did that ever come up? I didn't think it ever came up. That's funny. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:57:00 User.
Cyrus Schwert 01:57:06 Yes.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:15 I think so, yeah. All right, save. As element. Oh. I'll do this. I advantage.
Dungeon Master 01:57:15 Let's wrap this shit up so you guys can move forward. Zario, up at the top, it's your go. It's an acrobatics check or an athletics check this time. It's different. Just keep it fresh.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:45 Okay, cool. Yeah, I think I'm just going to do 120 movement. Also, the guy that passed me, he entered my space, so he should have took fire damage. I don't know if you want to do that since he just was quick, or I don't know.
Dungeon Master 01:57:48 13 passes. It's still DC 12. Yeah, go for it.
Zariel Torgan 01:58:14 I'll roll that real quick. Did that not roll? Oh, there we go. Now. Yeah, and I think he's. Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:58:18 I'm not worried about it because they have a lot of HP. I will let you know that that one's remaining HP is 237 still.
Kaladen Shash 01:58:29 Chip it away.
Cletus Cobbington 01:58:32 Yeah, you think that until they develop an allergy to almonds.
Cyrus Schwert 01:58:33 Let's go. Type two hypersensitivity reaction. That was rude to let us know that. That's just so much.
Zariel Torgan 01:58:45 So it's close. He's trying to bait us to turn around and start fighting more. I'm going to move 120 feet. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:58:49 Yeah, well, the other one's less hurt too. I didn't even change it. Yeah, do you guys want to take it out? Challenge it. Okay. You passed that other one, so it takes damage too, right?
Cyrus Schwert 01:59:02 I'll fuck the scene up.
Dungeon Master 01:59:17 We'll just say he takes that damage again. Keep it going. OK. Initiative count 20 entering the battlefield. It's everybody's favorite.
Cletus Cobbington 01:59:45 T-Rex, fuck.
Kaladen Shash 01:59:48 The.
Dungeon Master 01:59:49 Three base fighters. And. And they go.
Dungeon Master 02:00:15 On initiative count, 20. OK. First up is this asteroid spider back here. He's got 60 feet of movement. And then a dash gets 120. I'm going to put him there. He won't attack because he'll use his action and movement. Then, yeah, absolutely, as he passes by,
Cyrus Schwert 02:00:20 Did he go to my face? Can I hit him?
Kaladen Shash 02:00:42 Hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 02:00:51 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 02:00:56 I don't remember what their thing was. 17? Yeah, I'm not even going to worry about all the damage, but his speed is reduced by 10 because of my slasher feat. Disperse.
Dungeon Master 02:00:59 1717 it's okay, so he actually ends up right there.
Dungeon Master 02:01:20 14 damage. Still going to keep track of it. It might come into play. The three phase fighters, I didn't give them any advantage because I didn't give it to your guys' extra stuff, so it's all rolling flat. It was a 23 to hit, a 23 to hit, and a 17 to hit. All on Cyrus. Hell yes.
Cyrus Schwert 02:01:41 It was all missed because of my defensive force. My AC is 27 for this turn. Cletus is a Call of Duty fan. So what we're establishing.
Kaladen Shash 02:01:47 And.
Zariel Torgan 02:01:49 am.
Cletus Cobbington 02:01:50 Put that guy in phase. The spiders are just going to fizzle out. They're just never going to catch up. I guess 80 feet of phaser action.
Dungeon Master 02:01:55 After that, Cletus, it is your spiders. Okay. They might have, but they also take more damage this turn.
Cletus Cobbington 02:02:21 But they have free HP, so they're going to, yeah, they're just dead anyway. They can try to catch up. They almost do. And then they just like, Mr. Stark, I don't feel so good, and turn to dust. They just got Infinity Ward. Also to make all of ours.
Dungeon Master 02:02:32 One reaches out its arm at you. Oh no, it's a spider boy. Okay. Up next is the first spider. Does it still have disadvantage on its attack, Travis?
Kaladen Shash 02:02:38 Wow.
Cletus Cobbington 02:02:49 life a little easier to not worry about that. 17,000 attack rolls again.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:55 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 02:03:04 The initial one, yeah. It's until the start of my next turn. Yes. Yeah, that'll do it. Sure. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:03:07 Okay. Oh, so yeah, it just has disadvantage on its attacks. First one against you Cyrus is dirty 30. That's a 17 and a natural 20. Okay, second attack. Is it also disadvantage?
Cletus Cobbington 02:03:25 Fucking hell.
Dungeon Master 02:03:34 Okay, that's what I thought. Second one is a 23 to hit. Okay, and then this is crit damage. Oh, you're right, you're right. Thank you for stopping me. I was going to end you. I got really excited.
Cyrus Schwert 02:03:41 Josh Triplett- On this is Josh Triplett- Didn't credit as disadvantage. Josh Triplett- Yes.
Kaladen Shash 02:03:54 Right. You did.
Cletus Cobbington 02:04:00 I got excited. All the hatred from last session of doing no damage.
Dungeon Master 02:04:11 You take 21 piercing damage. And you take 8 acid damage. And then it'll try to do its web attack on you. That is a 31 with disadvantage. You are grappled. Escape DC 18. The web attack can be...
Kaladen Shash 02:04:28 My goodness. Rolling hot. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:04:31 Okay. Osiris is gonna die.
Zariel Torgan 02:04:31 Hot damn. Shield. Shield.
Dungeon Master 02:04:42 He's still good. You are grappled. It can be attacked and destroyed. It has certain AC and hit points and then all these other stuff. And then just for your guys' knowledge, the spider can grapple up to six creatures at a time using its web. You do have your one today's shield.
Cletus Cobbington 02:05:07 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:07 You could have missed all these. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:05:10 Yeah, what did you say your thing was? 27? 27 plus 5 clears everything. Invincible.
Cyrus Schwert 02:05:11 I forgot about the shield. Yeah. Can I do it on the... It's on the second one, right? Like, I could just shield the second one? Like, still take the first one because... Like, the damage that I took? Like, I didn't remember that. Or is it... Are you letting me fucking get rid of all of this damage I just took? Because that seems like...
Dungeon Master 02:05:19 Would you like to not get fucked up? Yeah, so it missed. You could get rid of all of them.
Kaladen Shash 02:05:39 If you had reacted to the very first one, you can drop it all, man. He's like, I don't know, guys.
Dungeon Master 02:05:45 mechanically you could have avoided it and it's still the same turn so it's not like you're bringing it up three turns later it goes to bite you and it goes to web you but what does Cyrus do to like almost magically fully avoid everything
Cletus Cobbington 02:05:52 Always take up the nice DM. Daddy's being nice. Take it.
Cyrus Schwert 02:05:56 OK, I will do that. I'm doing a big arcing backflip, for sure. Hit a fucking double round off, just gainer.
Zariel Torgan 02:06:02 Ha ha ha.
Cletus Cobbington 02:06:23 But you tripped the first time because you forgot how. I want my jaw to drop. From so far away, I see this.
Dungeon Master 02:06:25 Gainer? You do like the handspring off the spider to the Gainer. Yeah, sure. Go for it. 22, it's pretty good. I mean, this is
Kaladen Shash 02:06:27 Yes, it's good. Pretty good.
Cyrus Schwert 02:06:31 Yeah, it's like the pommel horse doing it off the spider. Can I make a performance check or something? Just for the vibes? Perfect. Pretty good. A sick backflip.
Leopold Magnus 02:06:45 That's great.
Dungeon Master 02:06:54 The single most graceful but athletic thing you've ever seen. In this turn, Cyrus has been attacked by the other asteroid spider, three phase spiders, and the second asteroid spider, all in succession. He has avoided everything. Kaladin, it is your go.
Cletus Cobbington 02:06:59 And with the shoes.
Cyrus Schwert 02:07:13 I'm sick with it.
Kaladen Shash 02:07:20 Let me double check. I think I used all my availability for three. I did. And I still have some twos. I will cast shatter and put like a 10 foot radius circle. I think it would probably touch everything and sculpt it right around Cyrus.
Cletus Cobbington 02:07:34 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:07:58 Let's see if this is 10 foot. Is it a 10 foot radius or diameter? Perfect. Yeah, you can tag everybody.
Cletus Cobbington 02:08:04 But you can do like the perimeter. Is that what you're saying? Just the outside.
Cyrus Schwert 02:08:10 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:08:13 When I dropped the AOE right off my chart, it's a con save. The big ones probably are OK, but maybe the little ones take a little more awesome damage.
Dungeon Master 02:08:30 On save. The first asteroid spider gets a nat 2 for an 11. Second one, 20. 20.
Kaladen Shash 02:08:38 Rolled so soft again. Just can't do it. That's a fail though. So seven damage. Let's pass. Yes. Okay. Nope.
Dungeon Master 02:08:48 And then first phase spider fails. Second phase spider passes. Third one fails. Nat 1, 30, 20, Nat 1. No, he can sculpt anything around you.
Cyrus Schwert 02:09:02 Do I make one too? That's cool. That's crazy. I'm just in a little donut of a spell. I'm the donut hole. Awesome.
Cletus Cobbington 02:09:07 Damn. Were you a glass worker before an adventurer?
Kaladen Shash 02:09:09 Fancy. Yeah. This thunderclap happens, but everything's just sort of muted for you.
Dungeon Master 02:09:31 And then as you finish up your turn, it'll be his turn. So do you use any of your movement?
Cyrus Schwert 02:09:34 As in running.
Kaladen Shash 02:09:40 Yeah, I'll move. I'll move 40 feet.
Dungeon Master 02:09:50 Okay, Cyrus, as this sort of almost like you have a dole to start like as if your ears are already blown up, but they're just dole ringing thud is everything sort of blows out and you can see like a visible white push of air. It snaps through. You have your turn. You are surrounded.
Cyrus Schwert 02:10:11 Yeah. Yeah, I am. I am going to have to. There's a lot of opportunity taxes that I don't pay.
Dungeon Master 02:10:38 Yeah. Yes, it would be.
Cyrus Schwert 02:10:41 deal with that. I'm just scared of that. I'm just a little scared of that is all. Sorry. I'm just going to take them. They're going to just catch me.
Cletus Cobbington 02:10:51 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:10:55 Yes.
Cyrus Schwert 02:11:11 the next turn if I push them away from me and then I'll only run 40 feet. I just have to do it. So I'm going to take opportunity attacks from whoever, I suppose, and try to cook. Oh.
Kaladen Shash 02:11:14 Yeah, you just got to go. Great question.
Dungeon Master 02:11:19 Okay. Okay. So as you run by all of them, you'll take the opportunity attacks. Does your defensive flourish also end at the beginning of your turn or the end? Your shield's gone, so you're sitting at 27.
Cyrus Schwert 02:11:44 Let's consult the sheet. Yes. I don't have it anymore. My AC is now 20. Oh, good.
Dungeon Master 02:11:58 OK. First, the big spider. That is 24. Second one is 18. That's one miss of this phase spiders. Much less intimidating.
Cyrus Schwert 02:12:19 Thank goodness. That does not hit.
Dungeon Master 02:12:29 That's 19. Next one is a 16. And then almost a 20, but it's a 2. OK, so all three of those spiders that you just take the damage from one big spider bite, you take 20 piercing damage and 11 acid damage.
Kaladen Shash 02:12:31 Yes.
Cletus Cobbington 02:12:42 I don't know
Cyrus Schwert 02:12:50 Let's go. Okay. Okay. I'm on a bonus action healing word myself. It's okay.
Dungeon Master 02:13:02 And then you move the hell out of there. Good choice. To that it is pleaded sister. Oh,
Cletus Cobbington 02:13:23 That's just there's no concentration. That's just the activation.
Kaladen Shash 02:13:28 Yeah. Stop. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:13:32 Woo! Spicy.
Dungeon Master 02:13:32 Oh,
Zariel Torgan 02:13:40 Who's concentrating on Longstrider? Oh. Sweet. Cool.
Cletus Cobbington 02:13:51 So we get that whole time. You know what, let's all bonus action. Healing word Leopold, since he's right here. There's some health back, 18 health to you. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:14:12 Oh, why thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 02:14:13 The advantage on dex saves is gone now after that. And I've been hit a couple of times, too, and I forgot to roll. So that's definitely over. Let's leave.
Zariel Torgan 02:14:17 Mm.
Cletus Cobbington 02:14:25 Cool. Nice. Unaction. Do that. I don't even know if it's worth doing that. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Please. 14 again.
Dungeon Master 02:14:25 Luckily, there are no deck saves at this point. And then also, go ahead and give me that athletics or acrobatics that reminded me of that. 14 succeeds. Ducks very quickly underneath a falling branch.
Cyrus Schwert 02:14:54 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:14:56 You know what? Just because I'm going to... Oh, wait, no. I can't cast another spell because I did Healing Word, correct? That's how that works? Okay. Okay. Now I'm just going to take my movement. I still have that Freedom of the Winds, right? Damn. Alrighty. Take my 75.
Dungeon Master 02:15:10 Okay. Yes, you do. Okay. The end of that... The end of that is Leopold.
Cletus Cobbington 02:15:28 It's Aurel the Concentrating Beast! Susan...
Cyrus Schwert 02:15:31 me.
Leopold Magnus 02:15:36 Let's get the hell out of here. And I just keep on blasting by. 120 feet. I'm almost out.
Dungeon Master 02:15:41 half of their initiative count, then it is Zariel.
Zariel Torgan 02:15:49 Yeah, um... Hmm. So I'm gonna move up to here. I can get to, like, 36. Trying to decide if I want to pick up and carry Cyrus. Um... I can go another 45 feet. Yeah, and he'd get burned. I don't know if he'd be cool with that or not.
Leopold Magnus 02:16:11 You get burned if you did that.
Zariel Torgan 02:16:18 Just left. All right, yeah, I'm going to pick him up. Do I have to roll for it since he's not here? Against his will, just in case he's not cool with it.
Cletus Cobbington 02:16:23 he's got a couple almonds in his pocket it's fine they'll roast instead of him
Dungeon Master 02:16:25 It's not against his will. I think he'd be fine with it. What size of a creature is the fire elemental? Yeah. I think it has to be.
Kaladen Shash 02:16:31 Hmm.
Zariel Torgan 02:16:46 Good question. I think it's... I think I'm only going to be able to get another 45 feet, because I'll have to half my movement. I don't know. Large. Really? Okay. Well, then we're going to move another...
Dungeon Master 02:16:56 Totally doable. Minimal damage. Oh, well, you're a size up. You can carry him without hindering your movement. Yeah, a size up. That's also why you can't grapple things that are larger than you is because they're a size up. So there's benefits to certain sizes.
Cletus Cobbington 02:17:06 Nice. For context, Trav, he just picked you up and is yoinking you with him.
Zariel Torgan 02:17:20 Gotcha. All right, well, we're going to move another 80 then. Oh, 90. I have a fly speed, so I'm going to move up a little as I go, and I'm going to drop him.
Cyrus Schwert 02:17:34 I got scooped. I am willing and able. It's fine.
Cletus Cobbington 02:17:34 at the cost of getting slightly burned.
Dungeon Master 02:17:38 Okay. You'll get a little bit of burn. Okay. He does take the damage from the initial entering your space for the first time, right? Okay. I need you to hit him. Do some damage real quick.
Zariel Torgan 02:17:48 That way, I'm not holding him when it's his turn. So he might take some damage. Yeah. All right, let me roll. Hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 02:18:04 Yeah, for sure. Of course.
Dungeon Master 02:18:07 Just because I want it to happen. Damn, dude. Very similar to the circle of the moon. Fire elemental gets that.
Cletus Cobbington 02:18:07 I missed you turning into this. Is this because of the phoenix wing thing? Or the cape? So you get to become a fire elemental with it? Damn. Fuck it.
Zariel Torgan 02:18:18 The egg. Yeah, the embered mane that popped out of it that shawl. Yeah, it takes two of my wild shapes. But yeah, I can do it once a day. It just takes longer because I'm circle of the moon.
Leopold Magnus 02:18:24 allows you to turn into a fire elemental. Yeah. Nice.
Cletus Cobbington 02:18:38 sick gotcha nice the fire catches up to them and they all burn
Dungeon Master 02:18:47 OK. After your turn, that'll be 1d12. Let's see what happens. It's another 9, which means three more fey spiders. Everything is way out in fire.
Zariel Torgan 02:19:06 Oh, yeah. Those guys. The one big guy. Yeah. This is what happened in L.A.
Kaladen Shash 02:19:08 never took actions
Cyrus Schwert 02:19:08 Yeah, have we been keeping track of the movement of the fire? I think you guys should be like conjuring 67 small rabbits.
Cletus Cobbington 02:19:16 Have we just destroyed the entirety of the forest? Well, as long as it burns all the damn T-Rexes out there. Tragic.
Dungeon Master 02:19:17 but the one guy that is on fire. So a new fire has started. OK.
Cyrus Schwert 02:19:38 each probably i think that would be wise you
Dungeon Master 02:19:42 After the three came in, it is the first one that's right. It's that one. Okay, this guy will they got 60 feet of movement dash for 120. You will get in front there. This group
Dungeon Master 02:20:12 The farther one back. We'll go there movement, which is 30 feet, so 60 feet total there. They get outpaced pretty quickly. But they will bonus action phase shift, so they just disappear anyway.
Dungeon Master 02:20:41 And then after that is this guy who will 60 and he can't get from our house. That that's irrelevant now. Calvin, it's your turn.
Kaladen Shash 02:21:05 Super. I'll use my last Misty step. Yeah. And just avoid the four opportunity attacks. I'll be right next to the big guy. Yeah. And then I'll take the attack, but I'll move 80 feet.
Dungeon Master 02:21:14 Go for it. You got it.
Cletus Cobbington 02:21:20 Nice.
Zariel Torgan 02:21:21 Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:21:42 Luck on your side. I rolled another natural, too. That's a 15. Misses. Okay. After that is Cyrus. Nice. How much movement you got?
Cyrus Schwert 02:22:00 I'm just going to yeet. I'm back to yeeting. There's no spiders around me. I'm close to the end. We're all here. I get to the end of the map, which I don't know is the full. Sounds good.
Cletus Cobbington 02:22:05 Run it back. I'm also yeeting. I don't get it quite all the way though.
Dungeon Master 02:22:17 Nice. Okay, we'll get to what you see in a second. We'll get there. After that is Cletus. Almost all the way. After that is Leopold.
Leopold Magnus 02:22:40 I think I'm done with this cave, these spiders, and everything to do with this. And I just... Kind of like in Toy Story when Woody and Buzz are on the race car.
Cletus Cobbington 02:22:43 So I guess I could.
Dungeon Master 02:22:49 Also Yeet. Buzz. Blast off. Top of the round it is Zaryl.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:55 Yeah, I'm going to just go. Also, I think, Edis, I don't know if you've been using it, but you've got a 60-foot fly speed. So you could be moving 70 feet. So I'll just blast off.
Kaladen Shash 02:22:59 You.
Cletus Cobbington 02:23:15 Yeah, that's what I did. Do I get to double that as a full dash on top of it? OK, well, I made it to the end there then. I kept using actions, so I didn't have the dash for all the other ones.
Cyrus Schwert 02:23:15 folks.
Zariel Torgan 02:23:23 Yeah. So I'm saying, yeah, your normal movement is 60, but it's... But yeah, it worked out. Makes sense.
Kaladen Shash 02:23:29 Yeah, 140 easy.
Dungeon Master 02:23:30 Okay, you're at the end. It's all good. You make it to the end, regardless. And then, Zarl, you were also at the end? It's just Kaladin then. At the start of the round, 1d12. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:23:45 It's 150 spiders.
Cletus Cobbington 02:23:53 80 spiders. Oh, no. My bad. 75 spiders. That whole forest of spiders. It's 100 spiders in the shape
Dungeon Master 02:23:59 No, no, it's not 80 spiders. It's just three more 50 spiders. Why? Because fuck you, that's all. They spawn at the last person. You really, really like T-Rex.
Leopold Magnus 02:24:02 It's 180.
Kaladen Shash 02:24:08 Look,
Cletus Cobbington 02:24:21 together of a T-Rex. No, we hate the T-Rex. That's why every bad thing is potentially a T-Rex.
Cyrus Schwert 02:24:28 That was sick.
Dungeon Master 02:24:34 Okay. We'll see how rough this gets. 5560 gets it to there. It's got 10 foot reach, which means it just hits you. And yeah. First one attacking on Kaladin.
Dungeon Master 02:25:03 That is dirty 32 hits. Dirty 22 hit. Okay, then the web strand will be against it doesn't hit regardless. So just on the first hit you take 19 piercing
Kaladen Shash 02:25:05 That'll do it. Shield.
Cletus Cobbington 02:25:09 nice and light
Dungeon Master 02:25:32 12 acid. That'll be that attack. This spider has to dash. And it technically can't occupy that space, so it gets stuck. Can't do shit. After that will be...
Kaladen Shash 02:25:37 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:25:40 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:25:58 The phase spiders that phased out, they come back. But they're going to be so far behind, I'm just going to leave them off. The second group, which is this one, goes 60. They don't get there. Last one, which is on you, will make their attacks, though.
Cletus Cobbington 02:26:17 Um,
Dungeon Master 02:26:29 First one is a natural two, misses. Second one is a 23, misses. Okay. Last one is 22, misses.
Kaladen Shash 02:26:37 Mrs.
Cyrus Schwert 02:26:41 Wow.
Dungeon Master 02:26:53 I already did that spider. I don't know why I jumped the gun. But then that makes it your turn. OK. First opportunity attack. That's a 30.
Kaladen Shash 02:27:05 Yeah, I'm just going to take the opportunity attacks and just get to the finish line. That one hits.
Cyrus Schwert 02:27:15 For sure.
Zariel Torgan 02:27:16 Yep.
Dungeon Master 02:27:25 You take 17 piercing, 10 acid. Then of the three spiders, one is a natural one. One is a 16. And then an 11. All three of them miss. And you clear out.
Kaladen Shash 02:27:35 man no what okay
Cletus Cobbington 02:27:56 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 02:28:02 We'll move on. You guys are...
Dungeon Master 02:28:09 sprinting dead ahead this entire time, going as fast as you possibly can. You guys are going around the bends, under the roots, over everything, avoiding the bites, sometimes getting stuck and having to pull everything out. But as you guys are running, you eventually see there's a very obvious break in the dense trees, almost like a pure line. There's just a beam of light coming in through the opening, and you're making your headway through there. The first one to jump through is Cyrus, without stopping you,
Dungeon Master 02:28:37 are going from a full sprint to just running in the air as you were just over nothing. There's this huge body of water, uh, underneath you, but it's like, you know, from the side of you, you have leaked into the open space from like a cliff. Um, shortly behind you is, um, Leopold, uh, Cletus, Zario, um,
Dungeon Master 02:29:02 delayed you see calvin comes out maybe looking a little bit more bloody than you had just seen a little bit everybody is free falling and in front of you as you're falling you are so high that you have time to sort of take it in you see the city of moonhaven a once thriving pinnacle of elven and fey craftsmanship moonhaven now stands as a haunting relic of a forgotten age
Dungeon Master 02:29:31 The city, once entirely enclosed beneath a vast arcane dome, now bears the scars of the Cursed War, the conflict that ended up shattering its defenses and left a huge open crack down the side of it on the southwest-facing edge. And I've got a map I can put you guys on, too. I think you've already seen it. There.
Dungeon Master 02:30:03 the lower half of Moonhaven you see as you are falling is entirely submerged beneath water. A vast, a natural flood. You see, again, as you're just free falling, the water, the huge river that kind of passes through this dense forest is being pulled into this city. And so the crack is only so big. So the water builds up and sort of,
Dungeon Master 02:30:27 raises up and half of the city is underneath water completely. The other half that is sort of on like the elevated part that's not quite underwater. It is above whatever is pulling the water and is been completely overtaken with the natural forest and the jungle. It is completely overrun. You see buildings with trees and vines and it has almost its own ecosystem as birds fly underneath the broken arcane like prismatic glass dome.
Dungeon Master 02:30:57 you can't see the source of whatever's pulling the water in, but it seems to be somewhere between, obviously, the bottom and the top, because there is a very obvious break, and nobody has to make saves on it because there's more for the effect, but you all plunge into the water below. You are a half mile from the very outside of the dome, but I think the first thing that strikes you right away is,
Dungeon Master 02:31:25 the water completely fills up the lower portion of the dome. So you can't get into this city without going through the water, as far as you can tell. But as you guys, one after the other hit the water and slowly sort of swim to the side, to the bank, you look up and you see like a couple of spiders flare out and like fall, but they'll shoot their web up and sort of hit the wall and just sort of like slowly go up with time.
Dungeon Master 02:31:53 As you guys recoup, what would you like to do? Yeah, you're like a little River Eddie bed.
Cyrus Schwert 02:31:57 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:32:02 Are we on land at the moment? Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:32:11 Oh boy, that was quite the ringer. How are you doing, Kaladin? I just kind of like pat one of the flames out of your shoulder there.
Kaladen Shash 02:32:17 He could use a race. Took some hits right at the end. It was very close to being good. John.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:26 Big scorch mark. Yeah, I'll drop my flame for him.
Dungeon Master 02:32:32 The spider that hit you was on fire too. That shit was crazy.
Cyrus Schwert 02:32:38 I'll cast a third-level healing word on Kaladin. Just in case we don't heal. Or if we don't rest. There's 15 coming back your way. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 02:32:40 You know, going back that way, that forest is gone. And Azariel just died. He just went full into water as a fire elemental.
Leopold Magnus 02:32:57 I'm pretty burned on my utility here.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:12 I'm actually decent if I take a short rest.
Cyrus Schwert 02:33:16 Why did I? I didn't mean to do that. I don't know.
Cletus Cobbington 02:33:20 How did you do that?
Kaladen Shash 02:33:22 Yeah, if I take a short rest, I'll get one of my third levels back. Arcane recovery, yeah. Level, yeah. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:33:29 How does that work? You can regain a spell slot of your choice, right? Yeah. If you take a short rest? Okay. So I'll do that. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:33:33 It's like up to your wizard level in half or something like that. In spell slots, highest you can take is a five. Kaladin, give me a wisdom saving throw.
Kaladen Shash 02:33:47 Right, so you can look at it. You can split that. It's five value. So two and three or five, five, one. Of course. This happened. How many, so how many I needed to, what should my con save be? Because I might still have bless up if this is a save.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:58 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:34:04 to a combined level of two.
Dungeon Master 02:34:19 We could say you're still under Bless. Oh, from the damage you took? You took... Where's the damage? It was 17 and 10. You took on each of them... Well, it's the same attack. It was 27, so that's... 13. DC 13.
Kaladen Shash 02:34:24 Right, so I didn't roll. Yeah. Is that just a... 14, 13, 13. Is it just my spell modifier or...
Zariel Torgan 02:34:45 Yeah, Khan Nice
Dungeon Master 02:34:53 It's a con saving throw. That does it. Maintain blessed. So wisdom saving throw with advantage. I mean, sorry, with that d4. Yes.
Kaladen Shash 02:34:55 Oh, just a con save. That'll be with advantage if I need it. Okay. With bless. All right. Oh, not good. Three down there.
Cyrus Schwert 02:34:55 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:35:03 Damn.
Cletus Cobbington 02:35:04 Nice.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:25 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:35:27 All right. Do I see anything that led us towards that little spider nest? Do I see any sort of continuing concentration of fey magic?
Dungeon Master 02:35:27 OK. What would you guys like to do? You see, no, so you don't see anything right at this point, but you do.
Cyrus Schwert 02:35:47 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:35:55 feel almost like a heartbeat to the city, something deep in the center.
Kaladen Shash 02:36:03 Short rest do we do we remember what the original objective was with coming here was just to find out why communication stopped or try to hence why the demise occurred was that our original
Cletus Cobbington 02:36:03 you
Zariel Torgan 02:36:12 I figure we'll just sit down for a short rest at the very least. I don't have anything specific. Yeah, I think.
Leopold Magnus 02:36:25 make contact I think
Kaladen Shash 02:36:29 So were we given maps or something, blueprints to understand maybe like a city center or control pod of essence sense to try to move towards?
Dungeon Master 02:36:29 Well, you knew... You knew... We can recite it to you again, because your instructions, the mission was to get to Moonhaven.
Dungeon Master 02:36:53 Find out why the city is flooded, because they did scrying surveillance of the city, and they showed you the general state of it. Figure out why it's flooding. And then if you could, without getting hurt, reactivate the teleportation circle that connects Moonhaven and Nunu Arbor. Sort of reestablish a...
Cletus Cobbington 02:37:07 you
Dungeon Master 02:37:19 feasible teleportation link between the two if not you were just supposed to find a way home like bail out save yourselves but you know that if you establish the teleportation circle you could also just insta teleport back so that was sort of the the get back part
Leopold Magnus 02:37:38 Jonathan, I guess in Kaladin's dream, the fey wizard said you need to go back to Nuno Arbor the way you came. Was that a coded way to say we need to go in the tunnels that we came out of at one point? Or was that just reading into it? OK, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:37:46 I feel like that's what the impression was. I feel like I don't want to like teleport and get murked. Sneak back in.
Dungeon Master 02:37:54 a great question and I think you'll have to answer that one for yourself.
Leopold Magnus 02:38:06 That's kind of where I was at. You know what I mean? Like, it would be very convenient just to hop on those suckers and go back. But I feel like we need to go through the tunnels. Yeah. Which is going to be a long walk back, too. OK.
Cletus Cobbington 02:38:07 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:38:17 observe the city before we
Cyrus Schwert 02:38:27 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:38:27 Give me an intelligence check. Yeah, kind of stepping you on that one. You can't really figure out anything. Seems like.
Leopold Magnus 02:38:43 Oh, fuck me, natural one. Well, we'll think of something. Maybe it'll come to me. So are we taking a short rest here?
Zariel Torgan 02:38:46 Yes.
Dungeon Master 02:38:57 Maybe the best option is to walk back, you know? Yeah. It's like what you guys are doing. You guys get your short rest. You are not interrupted. And in fact, you will find that the rest of your trip to the dome would also be unimpeded.
Kaladen Shash 02:39:02 Yeah, let's do that.
Dungeon Master 02:39:26 And then it's whether or not you guys still have them, but each of you is given a... Each of the original party members were given a water breathing potion in preparation for going through the water, but some of you burned it. Going through the illithid water section because you didn't know how deep it was, so you burned it before you realized that you could have used it
Cyrus Schwert 02:39:30 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:39:36 Yeah. Going through. We used one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So there's still two more in inventory.
Leopold Magnus 02:39:44 We used it already? Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:39:55 You could have gone through without just holding your breath. But I think Kaladin used his. Leopold and Zariel don't need to breathe, so they have theirs. Okay, so then he has just one. I mean, there's two in the party left.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:07 I thought I gave mine to Kaladin already. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:40:12 Right. I think if people, although people need them, that's fine. And I think I have altered yourself up in my spell book right now. That gives me like, yeah, I can breathe under. It just gives me gills. Like, cool, here we go. To explore parts of it, like we were given this because we knew it was flooded.
Leopold Magnus 02:40:24 That lets you breathe underwater. Cool.
Cyrus Schwert 02:40:24 Can I get polymorphed into a fish?
Cletus Cobbington 02:40:32 Do we have to go underwater to get into the city, or can we? Sure. Yeah. Gotcha.
Dungeon Master 02:40:35 I'm not saying you guys have to right now. I'm just saying that is a complete dome that is like the center portion and water from the river has like overtaken the crack of the city and like dumps out in a waterfall leaving this huge basin basically like a great lake in there. But there's like you can't get into the crack without going into the water. So you're always going through the water unless you found a different way in.
Cletus Cobbington 02:41:02 I mean, I can turn into a shark. But that doesn't really help Cyrus. The slowest of stories.
Dungeon Master 02:41:13 Also true. You could do that. Yeah. Haven't you seen it? They do like that weird leg thing. Yeah. No, they're pretty good swimmers. You should look it up. It's pretty thick.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:19 I could polymorph him into a huge giant crab. Yeah. They're better skettlers.
Leopold Magnus 02:41:20 not. Thanks.
Cyrus Schwert 02:41:28 Can crabs swim? Or do they just, like, walk around on the bottom? That's crazy. They do not look like consumers.
Kaladen Shash 02:41:31 Yeah. You know.
Cletus Cobbington 02:41:32 I got those back little flicker legs. You know, just like that.
Dungeon Master 02:41:46 No, I think they're putting in swimmers. They like fucking big jets.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:50 Well, yeah, they go like this. They go like that. Like you do. Like we did that. Yeah, somebody did that.
Cletus Cobbington 02:42:01 What if I turn into a whale and everyone hops in my mouth, just like Nemo?
Cyrus Schwert 02:42:09 Some crabs swim, to answer the question.
Leopold Magnus 02:42:12 I think that happened in your game, Jesse. Yeah. Yeah, I wonder who that was. I'm going to turn to Zariel and ask him, oh, Zariel, any plans with those wolf pups in the next few days?
Dungeon Master 02:42:20 I can't remember who.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:20 Yeah. I allowed it. Well. That's a good question. Is the is the dome completely full of water or is it just like half full?
Cyrus Schwert 02:42:50 It's not completely full, based on.
Dungeon Master 02:42:51 Very large percent of it is underwater. There's a section that is on land, but you don't really know how much from where you're at because you're pretty far away.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:56 I guess I might have to leave them behind, huh? Yeah, I guess I might just find a nice spot for them and leave them some food. They got the auto feeder, so they should be alright.
Cletus Cobbington 02:43:00 All right.
Leopold Magnus 02:43:18 Hmm. Well, are you worried about the full moon? It's coming soon.
Zariel Torgan 02:43:24 This is the best time for us to be gone. Yeah, yeah. You're going to experience some things. Your body's going to change a little. I'm not going to be here.
Cyrus Schwert 02:43:31 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:43:33 Just abandoning them as soon as it's inconvenient for us. Could I mold Earth like a little kennel for him? Well, he has the auto-feeders.
Dungeon Master 02:43:41 Do you want them to not be able to get out anywhere? What if they have to go get food? I think that only works...
Kaladen Shash 02:43:53 you
Zariel Torgan 02:43:54 Yeah, we can do something. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:44:11 well it doesn't have an infinite source of food he can't do that I was gonna say I definitely like the idea of maybe you like earth shaping like a little safe cave for them or something like giving them a little den to kind of be able to hide in but you're gonna rock shape a kennel like with the bars and everything
Cletus Cobbington 02:44:14 Well, let's throw, let's catch some fish, throw us some fish in their little kennel. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:44:38 you you
Zariel Torgan 02:44:41 Got the little squeeze.
Cyrus Schwert 02:44:42 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:44:44 Or just a little, a little prison cell window. Protect them.
Dungeon Master 02:44:49 I think that makes them the most safe. A little trapping. Yeah. Love it.
Leopold Magnus 02:44:57 Oh, Jonathan, I do have this golden fork, the glutton's fork, that has three charges. And daily in dawn, it creates food. Could I rig that up? That way it's with the feeder. Yeah, it says an object that weighs one pound is magically transformed into food and can be consumed. So three meals a day.
Kaladen Shash 02:45:11 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 02:45:15 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:45:24 I say you make a very intricate mechanism that is based off of a timer from the sun that you use artificing for, that the fork gets pulled back and then hits a piece of stone, and then the stone transforms a part of it into food, which drops down. And then it does it a certain amount of times. And with the right tool for the job thing, I don't see why you couldn't, with enough time, we'll say...
Cletus Cobbington 02:45:24 It's all good.
Dungeon Master 02:45:50 You maybe have to dedicate the night to this and you guys just set up base camp because it's towards the end of the day anyway.
Leopold Magnus 02:45:57 Okay. Yeah, there you go, Zariel. Do you want to do that? You can leave your pups behind.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:04 Yeah, yeah, let's do that. And then I'll take up some of the meat or the food that it turns into, and I'll use some sacred flames to try to cook it so that it doesn't just rot in the feeder. Because, I mean, the feeder's not clean anyway, but, you know, try to keep it a little sanitary. Yep.
Cyrus Schwert 02:46:22 So awful. We're leaving them rotten food.
Cletus Cobbington 02:46:25 We might be abandoning some puppies, but we're at least a little bit nice about it. We're leaving them around food and trapping them in a dirt kennel. See, the jail cell window prevents it from getting full moon contact, so it'll be all right. But with enough air to breathe.
Dungeon Master 02:46:25 That's awesome.
Kaladen Shash 02:46:32 you you
Leopold Magnus 02:46:33 It's fresh. They're getting three hots and a cot, you know.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:37 Yeah. We let the window down, though. It's those people. Yeah. See? Yeah. Some innocent bystander's gonna walk by and be like, those are well-cared-for dogs. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:47:00 That innocent bystander in the middle of the jungle. I think you're right. It's literally what they prefer.
Cletus Cobbington 02:47:04 These are clearly someone's property. All right. Well, how about we set up for the night, and instead of having done short rest, why don't we just take a long rest, right? I'm going to stick my staff.
Cyrus Schwert 02:47:06 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:47:09 Yeah. They love it. It's like when people see Huskies in the winter and they get upset. It's like, they like it out there. Yeah. Sure.
Kaladen Shash 02:47:21 And.
Leopold Magnus 02:47:25 Yeah, that works. Set up the hut. Let's do it. Well, it looks like we're staying for the night.
Dungeon Master 02:47:29 Edith emerging as a party leader. That was just really assertive, you know? Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:47:33 No. Well... I get stressed out instantly and start roasting almonds over the fire. No. Background. But I'll stake my staff. Make our willow tree fort. Make the treehouse. Can it be a treehouse, Daddy DM? No.
Zariel Torgan 02:47:39 Yeah, now what are we doing?
Cyrus Schwert 02:47:39 you're so strange
Cletus Cobbington 02:48:06 I take the whole night to just start working on it. How about that? It's a slow build. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:48:08 Yes. Well, it was originally something else. The original spell creates just an enormous tree. Then I changed it to a tree that effectively acts as Tiny Hut.
Cyrus Schwert 02:48:09 Building a treehouse.
Zariel Torgan 02:48:10 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:48:11 I didn't think about it.
Cletus Cobbington 02:48:37 Great. That's perfect. An invisible treehouse. That's wonderful. So quaint.
Dungeon Master 02:48:38 And what we can do is compromise in between where it is a partially big tree and then like, because it has to only be a certain size, like 10 feet up, like treehouse forms that's tiny enough.
Kaladen Shash 02:49:01 Jonathan, how long did we say it was going to take, or what sort of resource cost? Because I remember I put $500 towards the first, but I didn't remember writing down how many installments that was going to be. Was it Ring of Holding?
Cyrus Schwert 02:49:11 No.
Cletus Cobbington 02:49:17 you you
Dungeon Master 02:49:17 Because it's just based off the first level spell, right? So it's the same hour amount. There it is.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:24 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:49:38 So two hours for. Yeah, that was my first go. Can I pass all the checks and get the money later? How's that look?
Dungeon Master 02:49:46 Level 1 spell is 32 hours total, DC 14 checks, 2 checks. I think you knocked out half the time and you succeeded both checks. Yeah, I said that you couldn't finish the enchantment until you invested the money, but you could do all of the checks and then as soon as you had the money, like,
Dungeon Master 02:50:14 do your last runes kind of deal like yeah you can do all the time okay anything else
Kaladen Shash 02:50:14 last check okay okay all right i'll just spend a little time doing that tonight
Leopold Magnus 02:50:36 I'm just going to work on this Glutton's Fork setup for Zariel's pups.
Cletus Cobbington 02:50:42 Azariel, you want to get your pups? I'll build this nice little kennel. How would you work on sit and stay? And I'll form it around them. Wait.
Zariel Torgan 02:50:49 Yeah, yeah, I'll work with them too. We'll work on stay. Yeah, we'll work on. We'll work on stay for multiple days. Work on that one. We'll work on don't report me to animal control.
Kaladen Shash 02:50:58 Never ever.
Cyrus Schwert 02:51:03 Animal control is the leading answer. Yes.
Cletus Cobbington 02:51:14 PETA stay away if PETA comes then they can turn into werewolves they're only allowed then
Zariel Torgan 02:51:23 Yeah. Just working on just the control and hiding from danger, things like that. That one. Sweet.
Dungeon Master 02:51:33 22 is a success and continuing your efforts okay when you guys awake in the morning you have
Cyrus Schwert 02:51:34 Not killing their master when they turn into a werewolf. You know, normal stuff.
Cletus Cobbington 02:51:50 Such a cute little river.
Dungeon Master 02:51:58 the dome in front of you and you have the spider infested forest at your back, you have, uh, one obvious way to enter, but, um, it does occur to you that, you know, the dome that you lived under had multiple ways and it turns out. So I think it occurs that you could, um,
Dungeon Master 02:52:24 get in a different way. But while everybody is sort of getting their day started, Caledon, give me a wisdom saving throw. 17. Not too bad. How would you guys like to go about your day?
Cletus Cobbington 02:52:30 Speaking of Kaladin, I'm gonna hand him a nice toasty almond.
Kaladen Shash 02:52:44 Yes, this looks better. I would not take this if it was wet.
Cyrus Schwert 02:53:00 I'm telling you you've got to just
Leopold Magnus 02:53:00 You get the toasty one.
Dungeon Master 02:53:02 It is wet. It comes wet. You see, Chip looks really kind of upset that you're so repulsed by it. He's a little timid now and he's hiding behind his neck. Why don't you want it?
Cletus Cobbington 02:53:02 Take this for a spin. Sorry you got a little messed up by spiders last time. It's definitely at least a little wet. I caught it quick, but Chip had it like halfway. He was doing that little like
Zariel Torgan 02:53:12 You got standards.
Kaladen Shash 02:53:14 it's toasted i got the it's grass i got it what is what does the almond do exactly
Cyrus Schwert 02:53:28 I'm telling you, Kaladin, it's going to be gross. It's going to be gross, but it is worth it. It's as bad as it looks.
Cletus Cobbington 02:53:36 So when I get healed or heal myself, you also get healed for that same amount. And then any attack that hits, I can invoke it, and it makes your attack a crit. No, it's technically you ate it right. You have it right now.
Kaladen Shash 02:53:44 That looks cool. And I just have to eat the almond at any point, and it's good to go. Oh, yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:53:51 Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:53:57 Well, he... It sits in my mouth the whole time, technically. And when he activates it, you bite down on it. It's like... It's the consistency...
Cyrus Schwert 02:53:58 You have to eat it right now or it won't work, dude. Eat the nut. Eat the nut. Cyrus is relishing and watching someone else have to do it. He just swallowed that whole.
Cletus Cobbington 02:54:07 It's a little almond zen. It sits in your stomach. When I invoke it, it just poofs. Oh. It's so awful. No.
Kaladen Shash 02:54:11 I will, like, just try not to, like, even chew. Just, like, take it, like, just a large pill. Just try to, like, go.
Zariel Torgan 02:54:20 It's a limp almond.
Dungeon Master 02:54:25 of like a soggy crouton that you use in stuffing. It's so wet. And it's a nut. It slurps down your gullet. You have this uneasy feeling in your stomach that feels like, if harnessed correctly, could immensely make you more powerful.
Leopold Magnus 02:54:28 Oh.
Cyrus Schwert 02:54:32 An overripe avocado. You just squelched. That was nasty.
Kaladen Shash 02:54:44 Oh. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 02:54:59 Ask yourself, you were the first one to try it.
Dungeon Master 02:54:59 It's like when climbing, when your stomach hurts, you perform better.
Cyrus Schwert 02:55:05 That is true. And everyone knows it.
Leopold Magnus 02:55:09 Oh, dear. That seems foul, Kaladin. How can you stomach it? Oh, well, I can't taste anything. I just threw it in here. And I point kind of down my helm.
Kaladen Shash 02:55:19 I can feel it.
Cletus Cobbington 02:55:26 Fair enough. You point just everywhere. Fair enough. I guess Cyrus was the first to actually taste it and feel it. Well, it is polite to at least try to enjoy it, you know.
Dungeon Master 02:55:29 Gotcha. You smell roast chicken as soon as you smell that. Let's do this.
Cyrus Schwert 02:55:41 Yeah, I didn't know that swallowing it whole was an option. I thought the chewing was necessary. I really wish I had thought of that. No.
Kaladen Shash 02:55:52 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 02:55:58 I hand you a bunch of not special wet almonds. Eat them. Be polite. Chip is holding an angry fist up.
Dungeon Master 02:56:03 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:56:07 It's peer pressure.
Cyrus Schwert 02:56:16 Guys, we should all share. You guys take them. I'm not hungry. It's like very calm and relaxing, like NPR.
Cletus Cobbington 02:56:25 All right. That's enough almond talk. That was 10 minutes of almond talk. We're done for the day. What's my almond Joe? Yeah. We talked about the struggles of modernized agriculture in this day and age. And the innovation of trail mixes and whatnot.
Dungeon Master 02:56:31 I'm going to talk as clean as this podcast that he does in the mornings.
Leopold Magnus 02:56:34 Yeah. With Chip and Cletus's almond talk. Six to seven in the morning. That's good.
Cyrus Schwert 02:56:49 What's next on Almondog? Milk or juice? For these commercials.
Zariel Torgan 02:56:50 It's peaceful.
Cletus Cobbington 02:56:59 yeah is it almond juice or almond milk that stumps me I stare off into the distance I've never thought about that milk or juice stump
Kaladen Shash 02:57:11 Same down. Yeah. So I,
Dungeon Master 02:57:12 It is the same size. It is a mega city of elven architecture. Unobstructed, if you were in New New Arbor, it would take you a day to just walk one into the other, but there are like
Cyrus Schwert 02:57:14 Um, so this, this city as big as new, new Arbor, not as big. Yeah. So it's going to take a long time to get around that. Oh, really?
Dungeon Master 02:57:39 Metro systems and stuff to get you through. So you think maybe at a very slow pace, it'd take you two full days to get from one edge of the city to the other.
Cletus Cobbington 02:57:48 Damn. I build a tree mansion while he's building his mega boat for us.
Cyrus Schwert 02:57:51 If we went around it and it's, I feel like it'd be less of a, how long would that take? We smash cut montage, build a boat, all of us. What's, what's the goal?
Leopold Magnus 02:57:54 I could make a boat if we want to spend enough time. Yeah, there you go.
Kaladen Shash 02:58:01 So right now, Jonathan, are we just trying to probe? Yeah. Oh, I was just asking, this depiction of a river, is this the river that flows into the crack? OK.
Zariel Torgan 02:58:03 Three days.
Dungeon Master 02:58:15 What was the question from Kaladin? Oh, this was just because I had a river map.
Dungeon Master 02:58:29 It's much more violent when you are in person because it is being pulled into the air. So it's like a reverse Niagara Falls of just like water being shunted up at the dome. It hits the dome and it sort of splashes off. But then most of it gets pushed into it where it seems to have filled up and is like draining at the same rate that it fills up.
Kaladen Shash 02:58:38 Okay Okay Okay, I got it I got it so We can we can look for a possible other entrance Otherwise, we know that if we can get up there we can enter the crack and start swimming
Cyrus Schwert 02:58:49 It's turbulent. For sure. How well do suits of armor swim?
Cletus Cobbington 02:58:52 That's sick. I take notes.
Dungeon Master 02:59:06 I believe it is canon from himself that Leopold walks on the bottom.
Kaladen Shash 02:59:07 Okay, I got it. Good picture. They're like the bass. They don't have to breathe. That's how he managed the one time we got in the water.
Leopold Magnus 02:59:15 Oh, oh, this old thing. I just think straight to the bottom.
Zariel Torgan 02:59:15 Very buoyant. Pirates of the Caribbean style.
Cyrus Schwert 02:59:26 The kayak. The canoe over your head.
Cletus Cobbington 02:59:29 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:59:33 Which would mean that Leopold, without assistance, would have to be able to walk on the bottom of the city until he could get all the way to the top. I love that.
Leopold Magnus 02:59:43 In the meantime, I'm going to work on maybe some floats to keep myself neutrally buoyant. The ballast, yep. Yep. Let's see what I've got. I probably have some animal parts. I don't know. I just have a walking speed.
Kaladen Shash 02:59:43 Yeah. Ballast. A ballast. Put it in the chest. You should actually just do arm boobies.
Zariel Torgan 02:59:50 Well,
Cyrus Schwert 02:59:59 I start blowing up my plastic water wings. Excuse me.
Dungeon Master 03:00:02 Does a Warforged have a swim speed? I've never checked this before. This is a great question for Google. This is what Jesse's been mastering.
Leopold Magnus 03:00:12 Where would the swim speed be?
Cletus Cobbington 03:00:20 Another question, can you do concentrate spells while wild-shaped or do it before then wild-shaped and it still holds? OK. OK.
Kaladen Shash 03:00:26 I feel like we've made it canon if you do it before. Is that what Jess is? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:00:32 Yeah, you can cast and then transition. Um...
Leopold Magnus 03:00:44 Can you say that I'm going to use my water skin and try to kind of work it underneath the plate of my armor and fill it with air so I'm a little more buoyant and kind of easily swim without sinking? Oh, okay. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 03:00:46 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 03:00:57 Google says that Warforged can technically swim at the same penalty as everybody else. Swimming is just half speed. But I read this thing where this person says that they made their Warforged sink to the bottom as well. They did the same thing you did. So you can do it however you want.
Kaladen Shash 03:01:05 Is that? Is that?
Leopold Magnus 03:01:15 All right, well, I'll say without any mitigation, I would sink to the bottom. But I'm going to use a water skin, fill it up with air, keep myself a little bit light in the water. Yeah, yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:01:27 Like walking on the moon, you've got to bounce to your step. What's the plan, guys? Yeah, he doesn't need to breathe. So he could walk at the bottom. The point being is that he...
Kaladen Shash 03:01:39 The robot no breathing that robot You
Cletus Cobbington 03:01:40 Yeah. I mean, you can breathe underwater though, right? Yeah. Sick. Yeah. Right.
Dungeon Master 03:01:54 Like if you guys are swimming at a diagonal at some point for something, he is establishing canon that he's going to go like almost double the distance to get to the same spot. But he can mechanically swim. So it's going to be funny to narrate him walking. But we all know, in fact, Leopold can swim.
Cletus Cobbington 03:02:13 Right. Funny.
Leopold Magnus 03:02:13 Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 03:02:19 What shall we do? Shall we go in the obvious entrance, the easy one, or look for something different? I can cast Alter Self on myself. That will let me breathe and swim.
Zariel Torgan 03:02:29 Well, do we want to turn people into animals? Because I don't need to breathe. We got you covered. What about you, Cyrus? What's your plan?
Cyrus Schwert 03:02:48 If we're going to swim for like a long time, I want to be a crab or something. Being a gorilla was cool. I want to be another animal. I think that's fun. Big adventure vibes. Would love to be a crab.
Cletus Cobbington 03:03:00 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 03:03:04 well the potions we've got we've got the potions just means you swim really slow yeah I like
Zariel Torgan 03:03:05 Alright. I'm going to turn him into a crab. I already did it. He's a giant crab.
Cyrus Schwert 03:03:08 I have no other option as well. Someone else has to figure this out for me, because I don't have a way myself. I mean, whatever. Perfect. Perfect.
Dungeon Master 03:03:12 I would love There are two potions of water breathing.
Kaladen Shash 03:03:35 What the crap idea.
Zariel Torgan 03:03:35 It's like a really bright periwinkle blue. And he's got hot, bright pink legs. Yep.
Cyrus Schwert 03:03:43 I look like an 80s workout tape I'm like the 80s workout tape ladies for sure
Cletus Cobbington 03:03:47 it's always the most wild thing it's like a retro like a retro video game like character on the side of the like coin machine game
Dungeon Master 03:03:49 They're never normal. You're a Zumba class instructor.
Leopold Magnus 03:03:56 That's fun.
Zariel Torgan 03:04:04 And then his back plate, crab plate, it just says, like, Zariel is awesome in, like, lettering. Yep.
Kaladen Shash 03:04:13 Do you?
Cyrus Schwert 03:04:14 Brutal. I don't want to be a crab anymore. I'm huge. Let's go. I'm big for a crab, but I'm only like a medium sized.
Dungeon Master 03:04:18 You say in a language nobody can understand because you're a crab. Other than... You can understand that perfectly. Yeah, that's true. No, you are a huge creature.
Cletus Cobbington 03:04:23 Just clacking claws. Oh, you're the crab from Land of the Lost, dude. You're the giant crab from the fucking middle of the desert. Anybody? Anybody seen that movie? You're Gargant. Yeah. You are. You are the Land of the Lost.
Zariel Torgan 03:04:34 You are huge. You are a huge giant crab is what it says. You're huge. You're like massive. 20 something feet.
Cyrus Schwert 03:04:49 Okay. That's how you milk so many almonds at once. It's called efficiency.
Cletus Cobbington 03:04:53 Land of the lost crab. I'm gonna sprint and dive and mid-dive wild shape myself into a giant octopus. Damn straight. It's called efficiency.
Dungeon Master 03:05:06 Oh shit. Hell yeah. Okay. Nice. Leopold and Zario are walking slash swimming.
Kaladen Shash 03:05:14 Efficient.
Zariel Torgan 03:05:20 Mm-hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 03:05:22 Hey.
Cyrus Schwert 03:05:25 Sorry. Thanks.
Dungeon Master 03:05:31 Kaladin altered self. He's himself, but he's got, like, webbed fingers and feet and gild on his neck. And then there's a giant octopus that is Cletus and a crab Cyrus. As you guys make your way into the abandoned city of Moonhaven, we'll sort of end it as you guys are swimming into... It's such a huge space that it is...
Dungeon Master 03:05:59 like a void almost it's like looking into the bottom of the ocean kind of effect where from so far away you just see almost blackness as you're in the water um but as you you know even in the first 20 or 30 feet look down you see remnants of the lost civilization there are like street poles that have what used to be arcane lamps that just kind of sit there in the
Dungeon Master 03:06:23 the water unmoving there's a lot of like seaweed and kelp and algae growing on everything rising up but there's evidence of like destroyed buildings and stuff that are just rubble as you are swimming up into this space and unless anybody wants to end it with something special that's where we'll leave it for tonight yeah
Leopold Magnus 03:06:46 No, I did have a question though, Jonathan, because so more context around the meeting with Kaladin's uncle. He said not to trust the mage on the first council or just not to trust the first council in general.
Cyrus Schwert 03:06:47 Woo.
Dungeon Master 03:06:57 um the hierarchy of the domes is as follows there is the first council who is the head of the high council that seats all of the lords such as the lord marshal the lord of advancement there's um lords of other stuff that you haven't met yet um
Cyrus Schwert 03:07:18 you
Dungeon Master 03:07:25 And so like of the people who run this city, the first council is basically like the president equivalent. They are the highest ranking figure. And he said, don't trust the first council. Yes, I believe that's who it is.
Leopold Magnus 03:07:37 Okay. So I was just looking. So on the first council, would that be Thava Stormsinger? Would it be the Mage and then Gundark Copperforge? No, that was Kalmara Windrider, the Lord of Advancement, I think. I don't know if we've met Thava Stormsinger.
Cletus Cobbington 03:07:47 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 03:07:55 Yeah, that's that guy that was creepy with us. Oh.
Dungeon Master 03:07:58 Yes. Um, um, yeah, there's Calmer, which is the Lord of advancement. You have also heard of, um, the Lord master of currency, which is Gundar copper forge and the Lord Marshall Thur, which is who you've like previously worked under. And the first councils is named Thava storm singer. And you know them to be a, um,
Dungeon Master 03:08:28 Elder Pureblood Dragonborn. No.
Leopold Magnus 03:08:31 Right. Yeah, this one said people make fun of them. They're old. It's sort of people make rumors and jokes about how long they've been alive. Interesting.
Zariel Torgan 03:08:50 I feel like pureblood any race in the Dome would be a little questionable. How many possible people of that race could you be fucking for if you're all related? Yeah. That's what they're telling us.
Kaladen Shash 03:09:04 A thousand years, yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 03:09:05 We're good.
Leopold Magnus 03:09:07 yeah or yeah like like suggested they're just so old they predate any kind of like mixing yeah yeah yeah maybe they're just like the malfoys and they're all like their cousins and you know keep it pure but i don't know that's awesome yeah
Cletus Cobbington 03:09:18 One, two.
Zariel Torgan 03:09:23 That's the only reason we shouldn't trust him.
Dungeon Master 03:09:25 Cletus, you would know because you were from a different area. There is the Lord Guardian of the Land. Their name is Lamont Draper.
Leopold Magnus 03:09:36 Cool. I'm not Draper. Interesting.
Cletus Cobbington 03:09:49 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 03:09:52 And then other than that, you actually met them too. The Lord High Healer is named Milo Bramblethorn. You met them when you had the girl in the infirmary equivalent. You got a good vibe from Milo. Milo seemed chill.
Leopold Magnus 03:10:21 Yeah. It's pretty helpful. I actually should go back and update the list because there's lots of characters that's missed, but I was just looking through the transcripts. Yeah, because there's a lot of characters that didn't get necessarily picked up in the summaries, but...
Cletus Cobbington 03:10:35 Okay.
Dungeon Master 03:10:36 I can also do that at some point, too. It's got the highlights, though, you know. It's got Xander and Hagrid. And it's got... It really picked up on Sunseeker. Really, it was a fan favorite.
Leopold Magnus 03:10:54 Sunseeker with laser, taser, and blazer.
Cyrus Schwert 03:10:59 Ooh.
Zariel Torgan 03:11:12 sweet
Dungeon Master 03:11:12 Mm-hmm. Yeah, them. All righty, guys. You made it through the gauntlet. It never came up. But there was this whole thing that didn't even come into play.
Cletus Cobbington 03:11:18 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 03:11:24 Hell yeah. All good games.
Kaladen Shash 03:11:31 That was a fun way to get through the
Dungeon Master 03:11:40 If you got stuck in the webs, you rolled a D4 to determine how your character escaped. If you rolled a 1, you injured yourself while forcing yourself out of the web. And it was like physical damage, dislocated joint, like pulling your shoulder out of the socket, yanking yourself free. Because in theory, you're still running, which was 8 damage. If you rolled a 2, you gained a level of exhaustion from the amount of effort it took to unstick yourself.
Cletus Cobbington 03:11:52 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 03:12:00 Oh, wow. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 03:12:11 Oh my gosh, yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:12:11 If you rolled a 3, you injure yourself, but you lose 10 feet of movement until you get healed. And if you rolled a 4, you got out without injury, but you still spent your action. So it was only a DC 12, but if you failed, it stopped. Yeah, you guys prepped well for that.
Zariel Torgan 03:12:12 Yeah, those buffs came in handy.
Cletus Cobbington 03:12:23 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 03:12:34 Yikes.
Leopold Magnus 03:12:34 Thank God. Made it out alive. Yeah, that's true. That's...

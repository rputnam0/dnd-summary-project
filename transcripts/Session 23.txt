Dungeon Master 00:00:00 I usually... I usually... Oh, because there's more than you. It's based off a party of three, isn't it? When I build encounters in D&D beyond, I go until...
Zariel Torgan 00:00:00 Ha, ha.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:00 Now ready to fuck.
Kaladen Shash 00:00:02 Yeah. And then are we categorized as a CR 12 right now? I just wonder how you look like, yes, I'm asking, how do you, how do you, how do you look at that? Yeah, I was asking, yeah, you, you've got to recalibate.
Cletus Cobbington 00:00:09 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:00:11 as a group.
Dungeon Master 00:00:27 it either just says deadly or I make it standard creatures until it says hard, and then I add something so hard that it instantly says it's deadly, and then I say it's good. It gives you a scaler, but in general, if I wanted to be a 1V-5 or whatever it turns out to be, I will, I'll go like, CR mid-teens.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:38 Is this? Is this?
Zariel Torgan 00:00:38 Ha ha ha ha.
Kaladen Shash 00:00:39 That's cool. I didn't realize it gave you that up, but I didn't see that. That's cool. It's fun. Yeah. That's good. That's good.
Dungeon Master 00:00:55 And I'll either debuff or buff the HP depending on if it's heavily attack or heavily defense focused. That way it doesn't drag that on Minnesota. The standard is a party of four's level is the CR. So CR4 is a party of level four characters.
Cyrus Schwert 00:01:03 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:01:05 Is the scalar assuming a certain group size? Is that like for it? Ah, okay. Yeah, makes sense.
Dungeon Master 00:01:19 So technically, in low magic setting, it says like items that are truly rare and stuff are like hard to find. So it's like you have a sword, a shield, no magic item, that kind of stuff. But since I tend to play high level even when it's low level, like you guys always have enough stuff to have it make a fun. I always have to go higher CR and then I always do like side stuff. Like the elder brain.
Kaladen Shash 00:01:30 Right.
Zariel Torgan 00:01:31 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:01:45 When it had one sort of shield added to it, it's AC buffed from, like, 12 to 15. And when the second shield buffed, it jumped to 20. So it got, like, AC buffs as well as damage amenities depending on how much help. Like, little things like that, just to make it a little more engaging. But since Travis wasn't here, let's talk about it.
Leopold Magnus 00:01:56 that's pretty cool
Zariel Torgan 00:02:07 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:02:14 The party after defeating that astral stone chimera, attuned to the circlet, you took a night to rest before you headed back out, noticing on your way in between the two dungeons that Wesley and Tucker had disappeared.
Cyrus Schwert 00:02:14 Ooh.
Dungeon Master 00:02:32 Making your way back into the dungeon, you guys found through not attacking right away, you discovered that in a certain area of the circuit, you were completely invisible to all of the mind flares. They could not tell you were there. There was something even about physically being able to see you that they just disconnected. You were completely invisible. So you snuck your way through the dungeon.
Dungeon Master 00:02:57 passing a second brine pool in which you found an unconscious Wesley in a cocoon, multiple mind flares. You saw no evidence of Tucker, but an owl bear sort of barbarian type had been like half transformed and seemed unconscious in a cocoon. But then you kept going, making the decision of, it's going to keep getting worse if we don't fix the source anyway, so we'll come back to this. You descended.
Dungeon Master 00:03:26 more and more deep into the earth before you came into this large chamber with this huge alien-type skull in the center and platforms going up around the side. You saw two stone pillars that went ground to ceiling, and then in the back of the room there were two half pillars. On top of it were two mind flares that seemed to be giving their energy into this brine pillar.
Dungeon Master 00:03:47 Rising out of the brine pool was this large elder brain that had sort of this psychic shield around it that kept it from taking any damage. So the parties split their focus, attacking with, I think first was the insight of Pleetus who figured that they'd be enough of a problem that he had to deal with it, with a heavy moon bean focused taking them out. You saw that with the destruction of the mind flares in the back, the shield around the elder brain disappeared and you were able to attack it.
Dungeon Master 00:04:17 This pursued a couple times as multiple waves of mind flares kept coming back because of your roles. And they tried to replace their spots on the pillar to keep giving it immunity. Finally, you got the edge on it. And with a killing strike from Leopold's cannon, split it, destroying it straight through. No, it was your seaman's favor whirling. Yeah, that's correct. Cut it straight in half.
Leopold Magnus 00:04:39 Thanks, Faber.
Dungeon Master 00:04:44 falling side by side, not in the pool, but I'm a sort of tentacles in front. The mind flares in the room all dropped when this happened, but then you guys just took a second to rest, and we ended it right there because they didn't want to get any farther. So you guys, as it stands, somewhat hurt, fell as exhausted to some extent.
Dungeon Master 00:05:06 Both Cletus and Zario are wild-shaped at this moment as giant bears. Cyrus was on top of the older brain when it fell, so he's still standing on top of it. Like a hemisphere of the lobe, just kind of wobbly. But you guys have the search of the rooms? You've got freedom to move on the street? Yes, once it dies, the effect fades.
Kaladen Shash 00:05:28 Am I unstunt? Am I unstunned? Oh, alright, cool. Cool. I get up. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:05:37 That's pretty brutal. Okay, yeah, I'm on the map.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:40 Is anybody else in like a live map? Trees. Oh, gotcha. Okay. I'll refresh.
Dungeon Master 00:05:46 They'll not move you guys over. Hold on. You should have moved you back. You were previously on the tree map. I just had it sitting there for fun. Got your bare forearm.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:58 Yeah. Can we kind of just like a glance around the room, see if there's anything that seems out of the ordinary or interesting, just pass my eyes over anything shiny. I can drop my baroform now.
Cyrus Schwert 00:06:20 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:06:20 Give me a question. Investigation check. Yeah. Question. Yeah. A spear is a simple weapon, so Cletus can use that.
Kaladen Shash 00:06:20 Hey, Jonathan, question. I'm sorry. I still have the guardian spear that can kind of reduce to like a quarterstaff and then expand again. It's labeled as a spear. Is that something Cletus can do? Awesome.
Cletus Cobbington 00:06:43 I can use a spear.
Kaladen Shash 00:06:49 I'm going to drop something in the group chat. He can just look that up, right? All right. It's got some fun features, and I'm sure Jonathan's willing to continue to mess around with it.
Dungeon Master 00:06:57 Yeah, he can look it up by name and add it to his inventory.
Cyrus Schwert 00:07:06 Simple weapon for a simple guy, you know? I'm sure the grooves and divvits will be filled with milk very shortly. I'm wobbling on the head still. I think I found it's oxymium.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:10 Oh, yeah. Ha ha ha ha. Ha ha. Ha ha.
Kaladen Shash 00:07:23 Sort of.
Cletus Cobbington 00:07:25 Might as well add some shrooms to the almonds. Might ferment some almond milk, see what happens.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:42 And then I got a 19 just to check the room. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:07:47 19. Looking here, nothing out of the ordinary. You, like, you find discarded, like, piles of old clothes, tattered, things like that. I would say a 19's pretty good. You maybe find you can write down, like, 150 gold worth of various gems. Nothing specific.
Cletus Cobbington 00:07:56 Thank you. Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:08:06 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:08:08 Nothing strong enough individually to do a spell component-wise, but you know that the animal folks seem to use a gemstone economy trading system. So it makes sense like if old animals were turned to mind flares and then they discarded their clothes, this is probably what just had in their pocket.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:18 Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:08:29 Jonathan, if I recall in the Asheville-Kimerra chambers, we found a book of a scholar, some evidence of the culture. Is there anything like that in this chamber? Any drawings? Nothing. Okay, no. Other. Right.
Dungeon Master 00:08:41 Not in this chamber. No. You can tell the map makes it look like it's more natural. But if you remember from the description, this was very, like, carved out space. It's like there was the temple, and then the mind flares dug their own little dungeon into this. So it's, there's no, like, ancient drawing statues, nothing like that. Nothing like it's showing the map.
Leopold Magnus 00:09:04 Got it. Oh, that's a pretty good observation, Cyrus. Cletus, how are you feeling? You almost got your head sucked off back there. Pretty scary stuff.
Cyrus Schwert 00:09:05 They whitewashed this place. It's gentrified. There's no culture left. What?
Zariel Torgan 00:09:09 Uh-huh.
Dungeon Master 00:09:11 They have two different sets of water founts for no reason.
Kaladen Shash 00:09:17 Just... Just...
Cletus Cobbington 00:09:27 Definitely was not good for a hot moment there. Brains mostly intact, I think. I do a thousand yards stare. I'm still a bear, by the way. I don't know why. I don't know why, but
Leopold Magnus 00:09:38 Well, there's quite a hole right here. I'm just poking. Are you feeling this? First, with those big flies, now this.
Dungeon Master 00:09:41 There's like a clean-cut circle. Even on the bear, there's like a clean-cut circle on the back of the skull. No hair. Skin is going to be just received me.
Cyrus Schwert 00:09:45 You should sue for malpractice. You should sue for malpractice. There's still a hole in your head. Your surgeon didn't even close you up.
Kaladen Shash 00:09:53 It just... He just... He just... He just needs a long rest. He'll be okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:09:57 Monsters just love to suck me. I keep getting sucked. I don't know if I like it. Not in the good way again.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:02 Yeah, that's fine.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:18 Can I make a, like a medicine check to see if there's something like a poke that would maybe like move one of his arms, you know, make him involuntarily, uh, the skulls still there, okay, got it. Once you take a long rest, you'll be new as new.
Dungeon Master 00:10:21 Sleep is one off. No brain. Skull is still there.
Cletus Cobbington 00:10:29 Cross-eyed. I hope. That sounds like a good plan to me. All right. I'm going to, I don't want to be better no more.
Cyrus Schwert 00:10:32 It's fucking crazy. He's going to be fully healed in eight hours. It's nuts.
Kaladen Shash 00:10:37 Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:43 It was new.
Cletus Cobbington 00:10:58 I'm going to fade back. I'm weirdly like just about the same size as my bear, as my normal form. I just get like slightly less hairy, but like very slight. All right. Shame. Shut up.
Cyrus Schwert 00:11:07 Yeah, you get bigger when you turn out over there. You may think I'm hairy, but I'm not. Is it weird?
Kaladen Shash 00:11:09 Thank you. Don't do we.
Dungeon Master 00:11:10 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:16 Thanks.
Cletus Cobbington 00:11:27 Well, did some looking around. What's next? Was this the end goal or? Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 00:11:38 There's areas you've not seen, but I don't know if there'll be resource or money. Sirius, you're an adventurer now. What are you talking about?
Cyrus Schwert 00:11:45 Well, we did the whole adventure. We should probably all go home now. That was probably it. Level eight sounds like a good cap to me. Oh, yeah, that's right. My newly found identity as an adventure. I'm like, I don't know, Iron Man or something.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:50 And
Leopold Magnus 00:11:52 Um, well, do you suppose we, uh...
Cletus Cobbington 00:12:07 Wait, does this mean that no more?
Dungeon Master 00:12:11 Iron Man or something.
Cyrus Schwert 00:12:15 I don't know, something cool like Iron Man. I'm kind of like him.
Kaladen Shash 00:12:15 And we never really got, we never got like directions or like any more than like a vague idea where the village might be. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:29 Well, should we
Dungeon Master 00:12:30 You know that in general it boards the forest. It's like, from what had been described, it's like built on the edge of a tree line into it on a very large tree type of species, like huge trunks. There's some like tree houses. There's some ground houses that's built sort of on a creek. And there's a huge mountain onto one side. So you know from general geography, it's probably a little bit farther north in between, um,
Dungeon Master 00:12:59 I think I called it Drake's Peak or something like that, Drake's Roost and the Kiari Forest. I could put you on the main map for a second, just so we can make sure. Drake's Roost and the Kiari. So, like, where you guys are right now on this map, it's a little bit more like up there, you'd imagine. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:13:08 Yeah. What was it called? Cottonwood. What was the name of the village? Okay, it was cottonwood.
Leopold Magnus 00:13:12 Oh, should we go check on Wesley and see how that chap's doing? Okay, so to the north of us.
Cyrus Schwert 00:13:20 I think I've stuck. Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:13:30 Cottonwood is the town that he said he was from, the little settlement. What's the plan, fans?
Zariel Torgan 00:13:32 Yeah. All right. Did we want to see the hag?
Cletus Cobbington 00:13:41 Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 00:13:54 I think I think finding the hag could be fun.
Leopold Magnus 00:13:57 I think so, yeah. I think that would be the next step and then off to Moonhaven. A little presumptuous of you, Cyrus. I mean, maybe we cut her some slack. You know, maybe she's a hag, not a hag, you know?
Cyrus Schwert 00:14:04 We want to go see a hag. Her name's the hag, and you want to go there? That's okay. I'm an adventure now. I mean, our marketing could use some work. That's true. Oh, true. True.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:23 Yeah, maybe she married into the name Hague. Maybe her name's Clementine. Oh, fuck me. Oh, yeah. Chad hears all.
Cletus Cobbington 00:14:27 Cyrus, how many times do I got to tell you different is okay? Different is natural. Now I'm going to...
Leopold Magnus 00:14:27 Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:14:32 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:14:33 You're really enforcing that racism note that I put it there.
Cyrus Schwert 00:14:34 I'm just used to two water fountains in any dungeon I go in. And certain people can use one and certain people can use the other. And you know, it's a societal norm and I haven't challenged myself enough to question that. This is not canon. Craig, cut that out. That's fine. I don't care.
Cletus Cobbington 00:14:56 What do you think when you look at me as a cow folk? You seem to care about everything else. I guess I'll take it as a compliment, but.
Cyrus Schwert 00:15:03 That's great. No, it's mostly water fountain based. It's mostly water fountains. That's about all. I mean...
Zariel Torgan 00:15:10 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If we look around, are they like dead mind players?
Dungeon Master 00:15:12 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:16 Well, I suppose that's an odd thing to think, but maybe we should go find this hag. All the mind fliers dropped, didn't they?
Kaladen Shash 00:15:24 Do we need to sneak out of here? Like there's... Yep.
Dungeon Master 00:15:35 As you guys exit the elder brain room, you're making your way up the stairs. You notice instantly that there are no evidence of the intellect of ours, the little brain quadrupedal creatures that sort of just like walk around. You don't see any of those instantly. And as you make your way through the tunnel works, we'll say you get like halfway up the map and you still don't see anything, no evidence of anything.
Cletus Cobbington 00:15:46 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:00 Do we want to, like, I don't know if we could like make a role as a group or something just to say we take a beat and kind of just look around a little bit, make sure there's not something that we're missing now that there's no danger before we just skirt? Yeah. We want to just like, just scope the place out a little bit. I don't know if, for brevity, if you want just some rolls or if you want us to go through, what would you prefer?
Kaladen Shash 00:16:11 That big treasure chest you haven't told us about?
Leopold Magnus 00:16:14 Yeah, I think that's a good idea. Yeah, not a bad idea.
Cletus Cobbington 00:16:17 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:16:28 depending on like ultimately you guys are going to ask for the one that is better for you so go ahead and give me either perception or investigation pick depending on what your character would do you're the one who does it Mars that's fine everybody give me a group
Zariel Torgan 00:16:39 Oh. I never investigate. I'm not that judgmental. I just want to just appear. Everyone's best. Everyone's best.
Leopold Magnus 00:16:47 I'm going to do an investigation. Oh, that's too bad. I rolled a two two for a total of ten. Oh, really?
Cletus Cobbington 00:16:53 perception or investigation? Okay. Maybe it's that. Maybe it's the closed mind in nature.
Cyrus Schwert 00:17:00 Either one. I got a Nat one. Yeah. I wasn't looking at the right spot.
Dungeon Master 00:17:00 either one. Okay. I'll exclude that. 17, 40, 60, 73. Um,
Kaladen Shash 00:17:13 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:13 Yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:17 Iris, open your eyes. What's the matter with you? You have to look over here. And I just point into a corner. Blue.
Cyrus Schwert 00:17:30 It's really hard to see.
Dungeon Master 00:17:34 Mix success. It's like definitely finding some stuff, but you maybe didn't get everything kind of deal. And then we'll say it's only for like the bottom half that's not addressing the top where you know Wesley is or was, right? So you guys find you can put down, and I'll leave this up to you because casters need different things. You can have, it's going to be 500 golds worth of gems.
Cletus Cobbington 00:17:35 Oh. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:53 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:18:00 And if you want to take some of that off for like a diamond worth 100 gold for specific things, you can, but it'll have to be like established now for going forward. But I want to give you guys that sort of freedom to be like, I haven't had a chance to get this certain kind of gem for a spell. You can do it now. Yes, that is the group. No, no, yeah, it's overall that's what you find.
Kaladen Shash 00:18:18 that's as a group we all receive 500 or is individual okay that's great i have 100 yeah i was going to say i have 140 gold so other people that like don't have any inventory or need stuff can kind of divide it from good for you
Cletus Cobbington 00:18:18 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:27 So the only thing that I need... Oh, go ahead. If... I was going to say, if we can find a diamond worth 300 gold, then I can use my Rivifify spell. So that's the only thing I would need anything for. Otherwise, I'm...
Leopold Magnus 00:18:40 Thanks, some gems.
Kaladen Shash 00:18:48 I like that idea.
Cletus Cobbington 00:18:54 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:56 I don't know if I have any gold, but I don't really need any right now. Yeah, I got nothing. Yeah, well, you know, I mean, this, uh, this here diamond anybody.
Cyrus Schwert 00:19:03 I mean, I kind of just walked in here and now I have a sword and a choker, so I don't really need a... I'm just kind of here. I'm newly an adventure. I don't need a lot of money. But if you could bring me back to life or something, that'd be pretty worth it. I understand. What do you say, Jens, Lundell?
Leopold Magnus 00:19:11 I only have 23. Yeah. Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:19:24 You're giving Marcel the Shell energy, I think is what your voice reminds you. No, Marcel the Shell. Okay, you find a... Okay, you find a...
Cletus Cobbington 00:19:31 oh it's true never quite sure of himself
Cyrus Schwert 00:19:35 Oh, that's funny. My name is Marcel and I live in a show and I have shoes on.
Kaladen Shash 00:19:36 Yeah. Yep.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:44 I would say let's, uh, uh, Zario, go ahead and take that 300. That's helpful. Um, that at least 200.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:52 All right.
Dungeon Master 00:19:54 flawless 300 gold worth diamond um like about that size pretty pretty large it's not fully cut so it's got some jagged edges and then we'll say you find a sapphire worth 50 gold another diamond worth 25 and then some various gems after that rubies opals pearls golden nuggets nothing worked
Cletus Cobbington 00:20:08 you got you got you got a missus armor back home you're playing on marrying all these diamonds
Zariel Torgan 00:20:25 Uh, no, I ain't the, I ain't the, I ain't the, I ain't the armor tap, more of the, uh, type. But, you know, I'm open-minded. I'll, uh, put that diamond in my backpack.
Leopold Magnus 00:20:26 Oh, well, Zareil, are you holding out on me? I would have thought you would have said something. Well, sure.
Dungeon Master 00:20:30 I'm there. I'm sorry.
Kaladen Shash 00:20:36 He's in the Tomiton.
Cyrus Schwert 00:20:44 You are wearing a backpack? You wearing a backpack? I only wear the one strap. I never two strap it. It's just one strap.
Cletus Cobbington 00:20:52 A teal. True. True.
Leopold Magnus 00:20:58 Yeah. What? What?
Zariel Torgan 00:20:59 Jansport backpack all the way up. I got a backpack full of puppies, so I got to be careful. I can't have them on one shoulder. I'll take this time to feed them too. I don't know. I brought a couple mind flare bodies in there or something.
Cyrus Schwert 00:21:19 When did you ever dogs?
Leopold Magnus 00:21:23 Oh, well, there was that one Mrs. Weirwolf that we slayed, and there was some little pups. And Zaryl picked them up. They're his now, you know?
Zariel Torgan 00:21:35 Yeah, they're my babies. I feed them. I feed them good. I train them with treats. You know, they can sit and attack. Well, we're working on attack still. They're a little squishy. I don't want them to all day. I haven't brought them out about it yet. Yeah. Three.
Cletus Cobbington 00:21:55 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:21:56 So let me get this right. You took werewolf puppies and then put them in your back. Right. That wasn't the part that I was more focused on, I feel like.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:05 Yeah, well, normally they're in a workbox. You know, all of you've seen the like... Yeah. Well, they need some vitamin D, so I let them out. Little heads poke out. Yeah, that's relevant too. You're gonna try. He's gonna try to fuck me up, take kids back.
Dungeon Master 00:22:09 You've all been in the workshop.
Kaladen Shash 00:22:16 Yes. And now their father was coming for them. Remember, you told us about this problem. We were like, whoa, man.
Leopold Magnus 00:22:27 Well, that's quite good leverage, if you ask me. Not a bad idea, are you?
Zariel Torgan 00:22:35 Yeah. Yeah. He's going to roll up and he's going to be like, hey, are my fucking kids? We're going to be like, ah, these are different werewolves, babies? He's like, oh, what the? Yeah, we're still deciding on these ones.
Dungeon Master 00:22:46 Where's the rest of them? I think Cyrus is just now putting together that this group caused that.
Kaladen Shash 00:22:50 We killed the other ones. We killed the other kids. Yeah. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:22:55 When we got chased out of the farm, there were like wolves everywhere. Like it was going crazy. You're the reason I'm an adventurer? I mean, this is crazy.
Cletus Cobbington 00:22:56 You stole some puppies and ruined my damn farm?
Zariel Torgan 00:23:05 We're just like... We're just like... Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:23:15 Oh, aren't you glad? He would have been on the almond farm. Well, Cyrus, from what I hear, you were terrible at bailing hay, so, you know, I suppose maybe you lucked out.
Dungeon Master 00:23:21 Cyrus, you look at the blood on your hands.
Cyrus Schwert 00:23:26 It's a small world. I could hardly carry a bucket. I wasn't, you know, a valuable asset to the team, but, um, but I'm not there anymore, so that's good.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:40 It's just spinning it's just spinning in your hand.
Cletus Cobbington 00:23:44 His hands are so damn soft they callous over after one bucket carry. Delicate hands.
Leopold Magnus 00:23:50 Maybe that explains why he's so nasty with that sword there. How do we want to divvy up the rest of that gold? How do we want to divvy up the rest of that gold? Do you guys need money or?
Kaladen Shash 00:23:50 Thanks.
Cyrus Schwert 00:23:56 That's true. That's true. I have no grip on it. I have no grip on it. My hands are just looking around. And I think that's helpful, actually.
Dungeon Master 00:23:57 nasty with it. She's all flipping around. Gold's working around. Gold's worth. Jet.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:18 I don't need any. Anybody that needs to buy stuff in order to make their character, like, get more stuff, should probably take it. I don't need it for anything.
Leopold Magnus 00:24:20 I guess it was gems worth 200, right? I was going to say, I don't have much. And I don't know if I'll, I mean, I could probably make use later, but also if somebody else has specific need. I could imagine needing crafting supplies to build things.
Kaladen Shash 00:24:25 Yep. Yeah. Yeah, make use some of that to make Chip's gun.
Cletus Cobbington 00:24:45 Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:49 Yeah, I'm almost kind of my thought.
Cyrus Schwert 00:24:50 Yeah. That's fine.
Leopold Magnus 00:24:54 Right on. Yeah, all right, I'll put the rest of that 200 into my inventory.
Dungeon Master 00:25:01 Perfect. Okay. You guys are still making your, you're chatting loudly as you sort of walk through these empty halls. You find like dead corpses of mind flares that have just dropped once they're like, they're like five mind core died.
Cletus Cobbington 00:25:19 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:25:22 And you eventually make your way up to this brine pool that was at the top right of the map. And you see in it still an unconscious Wesley, the rabbit folk rogue who's in the cocoon. You see very obviously dead now the owl bear sort of barbarian type just sort of slumped over in the pod like it had tried to get out but had died. And then everything else is dead in the space too that you can tell.
Dungeon Master 00:25:52 You haven't checked out all of the pods you've just seen Wesley and the other one so far.
Cletus Cobbington 00:25:58 Hmm.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:59 Um, could I run up to Wesley or one of the other ones that looks not fully turned and try a spare the dying? See if I can just get a sense of whether or not they're just like done.
Cyrus Schwert 00:26:03 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:26:14 Yeah, we'll make it easy. You go for Wesley first because you see him as you're sort of walking up. You rip open the door. You can see he does have like a rise and fall to his chest. You hit him with a spare of the dying. And you see his breath is a little less staggered. Like he does have this massive dead matter in his brain from where that parasite was. But it didn't seem to take hold. So he's like.
Cletus Cobbington 00:26:31 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:26:39 recovering he'll need an adventurous long rest for his body to sort of absorb that and get rid of that but he's alive and you also see um behind so this is directly in front of you it's like back and right uh you see a different folks that you hadn't seen yet there is a uh
Zariel Torgan 00:26:46 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:26:52 Tucker?
Dungeon Master 00:27:01 A very feline, a cat folk-looking creature. Wearing, like, padded leathers. It's got a bow strung to its back. One of the ears is cut low from a fight, and the other one is full. Also unconscious, but steady chest falls. You, again, see no evidence of Tucker, and this other owl bear is very obviously deceased. But those are the only figures in the room.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:23 So, what's our group alignment? Have we talked about that yet? Are we good guys? How are we feeling? This is out of character.
Kaladen Shash 00:27:40 I would say I don't know if I'm lawfully good Yeah, I'm leaning good for sure I mean if we're already saving Wesley and this is one of Wesley's also possible friend villagers We can
Cyrus Schwert 00:27:44 I mean, I just got here.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:50 I'm definitely, definitely leaning good. So, okay, all right. Yeah. All right.
Cletus Cobbington 00:27:56 A very hospitable man. I'll throw them both under over my shoulders.
Kaladen Shash 00:28:11 and certainly walk to cottonwood. Sweet. And we found who just now.
Leopold Magnus 00:28:15 This might be Darwin or herb. One of the other. Darwin. Darwin. Right.
Dungeon Master 00:28:18 Darvin was the tobacco name. It was previously mentioned to you. Herb is the owl bear that is dead. Tucker was the bird folk, the kentu, who's not present. And then Wesley is the rabbit folk. Darwin is the other one you found. You had just hadn't looked enough to see him before.
Cletus Cobbington 00:28:28 I don't know.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:34 well yeah all uh yeah yeah so yeah we'll uh yeah we'll uh yeah we'll gather him up uh can i uh take a look at the albert see if he's got any equipment that might be useful for us and then i should probably take his body too i mean if we're gonna take them all out give him a proper burial
Kaladen Shash 00:28:46 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:28:58 you you take his body out and he's almost as tall as you in size uh very stout and like rounded like a cylinder arms of where he's very muscular um almost the featureless face but it ends in like a beak um
Dungeon Master 00:29:18 eye, one eye is open and just sort of like a blackish bird lens eye, but the other half of his face is growing like tentacles, and he's got like half of an illithin mouth. His hand kind of ends in a tentacle, like he was mid-transformation when he had died, saved him from becoming a mind flare, but was gone nonetheless. A strapped to his back is a double-sided obsidian battle, but it doesn't seem magical in anything, just sort of weapon of choice.
Kaladen Shash 00:29:48 Big weapon.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:49 Right. Well, if there's nothing crazy, I guess, you know, if he just says the other two, I'll grab him and start carrying him out.
Dungeon Master 00:30:02 You each take a couple of them. Roll me somebody, one person. Roll me a D4. It'll be a D4 plus one. Normal unconscious rules. It's one D4 plus one hours to see how long until at least Wesley sort of rouses.
Kaladen Shash 00:30:20 I'll roll it. One time. Yeah, I rolled. Dude, right? I rolled maybe four or five consecutive ones. It was nuts.
Cletus Cobbington 00:30:21 Go forward.
Dungeon Master 00:30:27 It's going to be out for a while. So you don't know that, but he doesn't see. He's like, he's not really rousing. He's just unconscious out cold, but you know you've at least saved him.
Cyrus Schwert 00:30:29 Max.
Zariel Torgan 00:30:36 Anytime we ever want something to take forever, we should have Caledon roll. It's always the best. To grow your arm. It's like it could have taken like a day or a week, and it took like the entire week. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cool.
Kaladen Shash 00:30:51 Yes. Yeah. We made as long as it could be.
Dungeon Master 00:30:58 Yeah, that, that sucked. I wonder if you're like that, is this shirt cock in it?
Cletus Cobbington 00:30:59 It's like when Deadpool loses an arm, the little baby hand for a long time, baby feet. All right.
Leopold Magnus 00:31:03 Yeah, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:09 Oh, that's so good. Yeah. Yeah, let's get them out and then, well, what do you guys, or you guys want to camp out here and then, you know. I didn't think about that. I didn't think about that.
Kaladen Shash 00:31:24 We may have to stay closer to this, because how will they go through the pool unconscious? We have a trick for that. Perhaps we have long rest, and then they can scream? I'm just thinking how we get out of here.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:41 Yeah, I mean, I guess we could just, I mean, there's enough of us to post up. Yeah, they're going to have little nips from their toes getting nibbled on by those dogs. I'll make sure to feed the dogs extra before I throw the people in there.
Cletus Cobbington 00:31:44 I mean, you can just tie them to my belly. So many dogs. So many dogs.
Dungeon Master 00:31:47 You could throw them in the toolbox, and then they have at least 10 minutes of air and just come through. There's shit everywhere.
Kaladen Shash 00:31:54 Check that. Let's get out of here. You need to make candle. They're always running all over the place down there. Make a candle.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:13 Yeah, they have a, they have a training mat. There's a training mat. They never want to use it. They put everywhere except that. See, I have a system. I wait, I wait until it, I wait until it hardened.
Leopold Magnus 00:32:15 Um, yes, I was meaning to talk to you, Zario. Um, one of those little pups defecated near my workbench and I, well, and I just pick up my foot and there's a huge pile of dog shit smeared into my, into my gears. I've been trying to get this out here and I'm working at it with like a little stuitt stick or twig or,
Cletus Cobbington 00:32:18 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:32:26 stepping shit.
Cyrus Schwert 00:32:32 The gears. That's great. Oh, dude. Don't wait. Don't wait.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:42 don't you don't touch it when it's wet you got to wait and then it comes out as one piece the candle training is not it's not good for colds they get they get little doggie colds and uh it's not good for their mental stimulation uh i hear so it's all right just just uh we're
Leopold Magnus 00:32:48 Well, I would prefer if I didn't have to and maybe you just put them in a kennel and it would be a little bit easier to deal with.
Kaladen Shash 00:33:02 We're going on.
Cyrus Schwert 00:33:08 It seems like you know a lot about it. Dude, you fucking reek. It's disgusting. It's disgusting.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:11 Wear booties when you go in. It'll be fine. It's just like, uh, like, like training. Like, you know, it's like training. You know, just good. Watch wear your step. Yeah, smell lines. All right.
Cletus Cobbington 00:33:17 Just shit everywhere. I slyly, can I do a slide of hand check to slip a little roll of poop bags into his pocket so he can clean up next time? Oh, fuck.
Dungeon Master 00:33:21 It smells so bad. You open the pocket toolbox, and it's just a whiff. Yeah, roll for it. Give me a sleight of hand versus Zareil's perception. Passive perception.
Cletus Cobbington 00:33:46 Not very good. Oh. Oh. No. I realize I'm compromised, so I just make direct eye contact and just keep doing it.
Kaladen Shash 00:33:47 No. He's just under... He... He...
Cyrus Schwert 00:33:48 It's
Zariel Torgan 00:33:49 My perception. That's right.
Dungeon Master 00:33:51 Still beats it no matter. Doesn't get beaten. I'm sorry. You're like trying to defend yourself. You see Cleet is like very nonchalantly, but very obviously kind of like slides over and just kind of puts it in your pocket. He's so big.
Zariel Torgan 00:34:14 I mean, well, I mean, I guess maybe tonight I'll do a little cleanup. You know, we'll let them out. Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, they are probably pretty hardy since they're werewolf dogs, so they're probably fine. All right. Once we get out, we'll start doing a little cleanup.
Cletus Cobbington 00:34:22 It doesn't hurt. You know, your kennel disease doesn't help when there's shit disease anyway. All right.
Kaladen Shash 00:34:29 I think we could I think we could have long rest that way
Dungeon Master 00:34:48 Okay. Do you guys, do you want to do some travel first or are you sort of betting down for the night? Okay. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:34:57 our companions can be roused and healed and i don't have a yeah and i don't have a ton of spell slots or these good spell slots i got ones yeah yeah i can certainly hang through a couple of them to get like half the stuff done because i know again just need a med tape
Cletus Cobbington 00:35:00 Yeah. So don't need to carry him the whole time.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:01 Yeah, I kind of don't want to go too far because they're going to be like, oh, yeah, clover fields that way and we want that way, so. Yeah, yeah, I'm good. If we want to take shifts. Yeah, same here.
Leopold Magnus 00:35:25 Yeah, and I only need six hours, so, and I can maintain sentry mode.
Kaladen Shash 00:35:31 Okay, yeah, we just need someone to take the last gift.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:36 I can take it up. I'll get up. I'll get up early and take the last year. Leo, right? Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:35:36 I'll hit the hay with my comatose furry pals.
Dungeon Master 00:35:45 Who would have been taking the second shift? Okay, so Leopold, everybody is sleeping. It's the middle of the night. There's just sort of the gentle, a crackling of the campfire, an occasional falling log as it sort of falls into the embers.
Leopold Magnus 00:35:56 Yeah, that sounds right.
Dungeon Master 00:36:11 A little burst of light explodes into the space. You guys are in sort of this open space. You're airing out the pocket workshop for the night, which is why it's necessary to take the shifts. It's kind of off in the corner, and you guys are far enough way that you don't get the smell. But as you were sort of in the stasis mode, but...
Dungeon Master 00:36:30 more consciously aware you're still not moving because there's no need to you see um just straight rising up out of uh sort of delaying position wesley comes to in a gasp and he just goes good good gods um i sort of like catches his breath
Cletus Cobbington 00:36:41 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:36:48 sort of brushes the phara on his face to sort of straighten it out and he's looking around and all he really sees are a bunch of unconscious bodies so and until you sort of make yourself known you see he's like checking himself and he's like feeling his head because the last thing he probably remembers is having this parasite thrown down his throat before he went unconscious
Dungeon Master 00:37:09 I'm very startled, obviously. But then it'd be up to you how long it took for you to sort of engage with him. You see he sort of looks around and he makes eye contact directly towards Darwin, sees the supposedly probably wrapped up body of herb, the owl bear, and he's looking around for the last one, which you thought would be probably Tucker.
Leopold Magnus 00:37:36 Yeah, I'll just kind of let him cook for a bit. And then maybe if he wanders over near me, I'll jump out and jump scare him and go, oh, there, Wesley, I'm glad you're awake.
Zariel Torgan 00:37:41 It's poor guy.
Cletus Cobbington 00:37:44 Ha ha ha ha
Dungeon Master 00:37:47 either. He gets up and he checks like the pulse of Darwin, establishes that he's like alive and just unconscious and he sort of relaxes. He spends a lot of time over herb. He does the undoes the wrapping for a bit just to confirm it. He started a little bit by the appearance, recovers it. And he's like making his way this way.
Dungeon Master 00:38:16 to see if there's another body, and then you jump up and scare him, and he's going to roll to attack you out of fear. Let me see if I can get his character sheet. She's not just real random. We'll just say that's what it is.
Cletus Cobbington 00:38:23 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:38:39 uh definitely doesn't hit only a 14 you see he lunges out with his spear at you um he didn't have time to do his psychic daggers um misses but then you sort of like detain him as he's freaking out uh so round awful he goes um
Leopold Magnus 00:38:53 Oh, easy there, Chip. Well, I'm glad to see you're back up and at it. Seems like you still have all your faculties, which is quite a surprise to me, to be honest. How are you feeling?
Dungeon Master 00:39:09 I don't quite know where we are. Last I remember, you guys, it was the first night you were gone. Tucker, he, like, his skin exploded and he turned into us a squid monster. He captured us, and then I don't remember much else after that. All right, I just...
Leopold Magnus 00:39:29 Oh, well, I can't say I didn't tell you so. Unfortunately, Tucker had one of those worms in his head. You know? Yes.
Dungeon Master 00:39:39 It just, uh, we didn't think it happened so fast. It's almost as if somebody rolled like a Nat 1 on, on if he would change or not. Crazy. Um, yeah, Darwin, Darvin's safe. That's good. Um, and I,
Leopold Magnus 00:39:49 Well, I mean, I am sorry. It is a tragedy. We lost your friend Tucker. And I wish we could have done more. But we did manage to save your friend here. And I gesture towards the feline unconscious. So, you know. Tragic, quite tragic. Yes. Yes. Yes.
Cletus Cobbington 00:39:52 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:40:09 I saw herb. That's sad. His family will miss them. I appreciate you saving our bodies, though. You didn't have to, and you didn't leave us. He sort of looks over you guys at this point, and he goes, then...
Leopold Magnus 00:40:23 Oh, well, you know, it was the least we could do. Figured as much, we were right there. Oh, no, oh no, it was fine, honestly. I mean, it was a walk in the park if you asked Bone Crusher here.
Dungeon Master 00:40:33 Um, you all seem to have your faculties. Nobody was too injured, too majorly hurt. Um, sarcasm. I appreciate that.
Leopold Magnus 00:40:46 And then his gesture to a bone crusher who is in pieces. And I'm like slowly putting them together. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:40:47 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:40:59 Right. I mean, it doesn't surprise me. There's three of you that are made of metal. I can't imagine these alien creatures could do much to you. Who would say that? Who hurt you?
Cletus Cobbington 00:41:06 pans to the giant hole in my head
Leopold Magnus 00:41:13 Well, you know, some might say I don't have a brain. I'd like to think I do, but, you know, the worms didn't quite get in there, right? So, well, there was some, you know, there's been some people out there. The hole that's in his skull.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:28 Yeah, it touches his brain, his leg, just starts.
Dungeon Master 00:41:30 Well, anyway, the big part of this conversation was just me waking. Actually, you see this reaches up and stretches school. And I guess at that. You lost us and you picked two new friends instantly, huh? Just so fast you replaced us. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:41:35 It stretches inside the hole. Cyrus rips a nasty fart. It's...
Cletus Cobbington 00:41:44 Ha ha ha ha.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:54 Oh, yeah, these two, well, to be honest, not sure how they managed to find us. They've been quite helpful, yes. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:42:07 They're from what we are from. No, that's right. I'm out of here. Just chimed in. I'm just meditating, man, right.
Dungeon Master 00:42:08 You're sleeping. He's just so perfectly kidding. We can say, yeah, with Leopold's loud talking in general, anybody who wants to have woken up
Cyrus Schwert 00:42:14 He's talking in his sleep is just weirdly applicable.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:17 Yeah, he's... This is very relevant. Yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:42:25 Yeah, you could be easily roused. Oh, yeah, you could be easily roused.
Cletus Cobbington 00:42:27 Cyrus has the worst bedside.
Dungeon Master 00:42:35 can be, like, rousing because he's having a conversation at full volume. You guys, I've only been sleeping for, like, four hours. It's end of Paladin's night, but everybody else is so tired.
Kaladen Shash 00:42:40 It's
Cyrus Schwert 00:42:44 Is there a fucking volume knob on that guy? For a chance. Oh, my God. Oh. I can't do this right now, guys. I can't do it. I don't wake up.
Leopold Magnus 00:42:52 Good morning, everyone. Did I wake you? I'm sorry, our friend Wesley here. He's awake.
Cletus Cobbington 00:43:00 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:00 Oh, no. This rolls over. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:43:09 Just alcohol. And then with that, you see this other one wakes up. There's no token for him because I didn't have a good character art. But this Tabaxi Ranger type wakes up and sort of one eye opens in the other dozen and sort of catches up and blinking pretty hard before just like looking around, getting really startled, like up on the back, super hunched hair sort of stands up and just goes...
Dungeon Master 00:43:38 Makes eye contact Leslie eases for a second and goes, I don't understand. What's happened? And then you guys have to spend all this time catching up Darwin on everything. The impression you get from Darwin is very standoffish. Doesn't super seem to enjoy people's company as you were having this sort of hour long chat to catch up. Kind of a pessimist in general.
Cyrus Schwert 00:43:40 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 00:44:07 But I'm very close friend with Wesley. And so they instantly sort of grouped together by the fire. Doesn't seem comfortable with the other people yet. And then you guys could go back to your separate fulfilling your long rest. Cowden would be done at that point because he only needs four hours. Leopold would go back into his stasis. Everybody would sort of fall back asleep.
Cletus Cobbington 00:44:26 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 00:44:33 who woke up. But then beforehand, whoever's still talking to Wesley, he lets you know sort of the direction that you need to go to get to Cottonwood, a little bit more instructions. He's just, well, um, um, you did us a great favor by helping us out. He looks around. He doesn't see anything immediately. He goes, was there, um, well, we'd be sort of, we're going after those dungeons to see if there was anything worth using for, to protect our town, but, um,
Dungeon Master 00:45:04 I suspect maybe it was a wasted trip, just sort of full of death and disappointment, being totally honest. So you don't have to come. We don't need an escort back necessarily, but we're heading back to town to let our sort of town leader know that we'll have to find other means to help our problems. And then fade to black as you guys wake up in the morning.
Leopold Magnus 00:45:35 Can I ask him what their woes were? I don't, I guess the call.
Dungeon Master 00:45:36 You all get... Yes, you can. Wesley explains that for some time, once there's like a historic threat of...
Kaladen Shash 00:45:38 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:45:50 Like you guys had seen the artwork of the elephants, taking on the animal folk, that sort of dying down the mine flare colony took hold, yada, yada. And then this establishment of cotton would have found it. And he says that in the last couple years, there have been intermittent raids on the town, these sort of hyena-type monsters...
Dungeon Master 00:46:12 will come down during heavy mist and assault the town just taking their goods resources livestock it seems more of torture than of like malice they have some intelligence to them um and there is some worship of this great fire deity um that nobody's ever seen but
Cletus Cobbington 00:46:28 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:46:34 There's just this legend that this creature lives on the mountain and these sort of raids stem from the mountain into the town. And it's always characterized by as the fog rolls in, there's this stream of like torches that almost look like a fire serpent. It's like just this thing that they do. At first they thought it was a dragon and then they saw it was just a raiding party. And this has been going on for quite some time. And it only ever happens with the heavy fogs.
Dungeon Master 00:47:04 But Wesley and his group were sort of dispatched to see if they could find anything to help fight this. And that's sort of just their general problem they've been having. Yes.
Leopold Magnus 00:47:18 Got it. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:47:19 Wesley, I have a question for you. You mentioned this thing called the Hague when we discussed perhaps how to undo what happened to your friend. Is this a good or bad?
Dungeon Master 00:47:37 But total honesty, I couldn't tell you. We all refer to her in very familiar tones, but think of her more of a folklore fact that she's part of our history. It's rumored that Cornelius, he's our town shaman. He might be the only one old enough to have actually met her, but she's just this figure that said to protect the nature and the forest.
Cletus Cobbington 00:47:50 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:48:07 She strides around on her cabin built on chicken legs. You know, it's very scary for the children, but it's some, you know, nobody, nobody that I know has met her. But I would say, I was making the comments more of, if anybody would know her of what those creatures were, it would be her. Because I'd never heard of those. It was.
Kaladen Shash 00:48:24 in your story. Okay, fast. Okay. Perhaps we go to this town, get some information.
Dungeon Master 00:48:36 Yeah, I should have called me out on the spot. I could have clarified. I don't actually know that this is a person you can talk to. You'd have to ask Cornelius.
Cyrus Schwert 00:48:40 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:48:54 Maybe help some people out. Keep going north to the dome. Wesley, how many day travel is the to your village?
Cletus Cobbington 00:49:00 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:00 Yeah. I see. I'm always in the mood for helping out, folk.
Leopold Magnus 00:49:04 Oh, I think that's an excellent idea.
Dungeon Master 00:49:20 If you make a good pace, it's probably five or six days unimpeded. Right on. Tucker, in sort of his gruff, uninterested, just goes, William...
Kaladen Shash 00:49:27 Lots of walking. Okay, let's do this.
Dungeon Master 00:49:46 I can find a shortcut and maybe cut it down by a day. I just need some help. Not very tall. I can climb the trees. But if everybody can give me a general heading and the tall grasses, we always want to head for the tallest tree. That'll take us the most direct path back to cottonwood. Essentially, as you guys make your way back, you'll make survival checks. And if it's over a certain number, you'd get a day taken off. It's under a certain number. You'd get a day out of it.
Cyrus Schwert 00:50:04 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:50:05 How many days? What was the total travel time? Hmm. Um, I think... Let me check something. I think, uh, we could probably cut that down if we, uh,
Dungeon Master 00:50:18 Five to six days at a brisk.
Kaladen Shash 00:50:18 Part of she said.
Zariel Torgan 00:50:37 some wild shapes with like a giant eagle or something if i mean if you know if you're talking like a week you know that that's not nothing i don't know what do you guys think i mean i could i could giant eagle and carry it like a person or two probably and then i'll know if cletis if you could giant eagle or not oh well i could
Cletus Cobbington 00:51:00 I can't turn into anything that flies, but I sure can run. All my stuff is saying, wait, let me go back through. Well, maybe I can know. Well, maybe I can know.
Dungeon Master 00:51:06 At level eight, I believe you can turn into something that flies. Let me, let me just Google it.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:07 Hmm. Let me check. Let me double check mine. I mean, we can still do it. I just, for some reason I thought that I could. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:51:29 Maybe it was level seven. Oh, that's what it was. Yep.
Dungeon Master 00:51:33 A druid can typically wild shape into a flying creature when they reach eighth level. Because at that point, you can gain access to beasts with the CR rating of one, which includes Giant Eagle.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:51 Mine shows CR2 for combat circles for a combat wild shape. Uh, gotcha. Gotcha. Right. Right. Well.
Cletus Cobbington 00:51:58 Yeah, you have a higher one. My circle of the shepherd adds stuff to other stuff versus my own wild shape. I could turn into a big pack donkey and everyone can saddle up. I'll take the ground, you take the air.
Cyrus Schwert 00:52:07 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:23 Well, I mean, if we wanted to, my wild shape lasts eight hours, you know, I could... Okay. He just really wants to be a monkey. Yeah, he's like, oh, no, I can't, I can't fly, but if you guys all want to pile on...
Dungeon Master 00:52:28 But also, Cetus can turn into an eagle. CR1 is all he needs to be. So he doesn't need to be a donkey. That's, that be his character choice.
Cletus Cobbington 00:52:37 I've always dreamed of being a dog. Don't tip me with a good time. Let's see.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:45 Well, Cletus, if you don't mind being an ass, I'll write it.
Kaladen Shash 00:52:51 How long is polymorph?
Cyrus Schwert 00:52:53 Holy shit, dude.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:58 Oh, shit. Well, do you guys want to do you guys want to do you guys want to do that shave off maybe a little bit of time? Yeah, it's only an hour.
Cletus Cobbington 00:53:06 I could also polymorph someone if we need another eagle of sorts. I can turn someone else into it as well. I guess that's a concentration. That wouldn't help very much. One hour and concentration. Never mind.
Dungeon Master 00:53:23 I think that's only an hour, yeah. You could maintain concentration, that's fine. You can concentrate in a wild shape. But if two giant eagles could each hold two people, you would be fine.
Kaladen Shash 00:53:28 I could get it real fun.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:28 Well, I mean, if we did it, you know, you have... Yeah. Yeah. Just a real... A real... A real fat, fluffy dove.
Cletus Cobbington 00:53:41 Yeah, all right. I turn into a real raggedy giant vulture. A couple, couple wheat sprigs coming off the wings. Actually, I would love to be a giant goose.
Dungeon Master 00:53:56 A giant dove eagle. You turn, he turned into, plead his wild shapes into a runner duck.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:58 Just the size of a giant eagle. Great white. That's made of... It's made of metal.
Cyrus Schwert 00:54:13 Oh. You see a normal size duck? I see a normal size duck? I see. I see.
Cletus Cobbington 00:54:15 Real long, wait. A real long neck. Someone just needs to straddle my long giant neck. It's so, like, bowed with the weight of someone. No, I'm huge.
Kaladen Shash 00:54:27 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:32 Oh, geez. Oh, geez. You're flying at like a 45 degree angle, just trying to keep up.
Dungeon Master 00:54:32 No, he's, he's, he's, he's a giant, he's a giant, Leopold is so heavy. Like, way forward. You can hear his breathing.
Leopold Magnus 00:54:33 Oh, you don't have to ask me twice. Let me get up on this turkey neck and ride it.
Cyrus Schwert 00:54:44 That you're obsessed.
Cletus Cobbington 00:54:46 My neck is so bowed and dipped with the weight of you hanging on. I feel like look straight up. No... No... No...
Leopold Magnus 00:55:03 I'm only hanging off of my arms. The rest of my body and legs are dangling. I'm barely making it. Oh, oh, careful there. Oh, oh, God. Oh, God. I'm barely. Oh, my God.
Dungeon Master 00:55:04 Um.
Zariel Torgan 00:55:11 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:55:16 I ask.
Dungeon Master 00:55:16 Eventually, you guys cut the height and with the multiple wild shapes and then maybe combination of polymorph, you guys could cut this like six-day travel down into two days because you're going so much faster. You don't deal with terrain. You go over the tree line. So we're just going to do two encounter checks. I just need two survival roles as you guys make it your way through.
Cyrus Schwert 00:55:44 Thank you
Cletus Cobbington 00:55:46 I'll do a survival since I'm one of the carriers. I got good wisdom.
Dungeon Master 00:55:51 Just give me a survival. Nice. First day goes by without issue, without fall. It's clear weather. There may be a storm in the distant horizon, but nothing that seems like it's going to impede your way. Um,
Zariel Torgan 00:55:55 Oh yeah, I guess I can do one since I'm carrying two, so I'll do one real quick.
Dungeon Master 00:56:11 And as you guys are making your way, you take a night's rest. The second day is going to go fine. But everybody give me, this is before you've gone to bed. Everybody can do it together. It'll be a group average unless one person rolls very high just because it's a high D.C. But as you guys are making your camp for the night, everybody gives me a perception check.
Cyrus Schwert 00:56:20 Thanks.
Cletus Cobbington 00:56:38 Nat 20.
Zariel Torgan 00:56:40 At one. Damn, you guys.
Dungeon Master 00:56:41 Trace, that is what I was looking for. Just pick up on somebody early is just a fun thing. You know, just a little thing. We'll say since there's only one Nat 20 and the overall average wasn't amazing.
Kaladen Shash 00:56:47 Point three.
Cyrus Schwert 00:56:50 17. Yeah, only one.
Leopold Magnus 00:56:51 You're looking for a natural 20. That's hard to pick up on.
Dungeon Master 00:57:10 Everybody is like going to sleep and Cletus is cleaning up his dishes. He's rinsing out his almond milk cup. And he's like sort of the one on first watch as everybody goes to sleep. Cletus, you see in the sky above the cloud line way up there. You can't make out any real distinction. This is only something you get because of the night 20. You see what looks like.
Cletus Cobbington 00:57:17 Mm-hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 00:57:25 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:57:34 A miniature sun, it's just an explosion of red, yellow, and orange, like a ball of fire, sort of lighting up the clouds from above. So you're seeing the light up of the clouds, but not actually the shape. This shape sort of just coast over through the sky, just into the distance. Eventually, you can't see it anymore, but like you're the only one who sees it, but there is just this trail of almost like the sky catches fire.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:01 So,
Dungeon Master 00:58:05 before it fades into nothing. And with a Nat 20, that's all you get. It is almost like a shooting star or a comet like crashes down to Earth. That's how, like, quick it happened, but it's just a streak of light. Boiled. Alcoholic almond. War.
Cletus Cobbington 00:58:07 Hmm. Must be something in the almond milk. It's fermenting. All right. Well, everyone's asleep, so.
Kaladen Shash 00:58:25 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 00:58:30 I mean, it's never been cold, not once. I don't know.
Cletus Cobbington 00:58:36 I guess, is this important enough here now or when, all right, I fall asleep briskly singing great balls of fire. Roll in my head. I also told everyone.
Dungeon Master 00:58:36 Yeah. But you do see that. Coming the tune before you finally falls late. Next day goes off without a hitch. You guys mount up on your duck and dove forms and you fly through the air. And eventually it starts off really small.
Cyrus Schwert 00:59:05 I'm having a black flying around. Who on the dove? I've never, I've just been like a homebody forever. He's like, I'm flying on a dove. I was working on an almond farm four days ago. This is pretty fucking awesome.
Cletus Cobbington 00:59:08 I don't know.
Kaladen Shash 00:59:16 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:59:21 And Jesse's wild shape, Dario tends to take the form of something a little more metallic too. So he's like this dove giant eagle that's got like an iridescent metallic look to it somehow too. It's wild shit. Starting off his small... Yeah. Just the same long...
Cletus Cobbington 00:59:40 So different. I'm such a muddy duck.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:41 Very steampunk. Yeah, just.
Dungeon Master 00:59:51 You see this little, it's like a peninsula of four comes out from the main patch. So there's this really dense jungle almost. And then it comes off sort of intersecting the plains and the mountain is just past and beyond. Slowly coming into view, you see this little settlement of wooden buildings, stashed roofs, tall trees with lanterns hanging from them, tree houses in the distance. A little cute trick running through the center.
Cyrus Schwert 01:00:15 Excuse me.
Dungeon Master 01:00:20 little animal folks going throughout their day picking up buckets of water taking it through little kids playing ball on stick and stick and cup and they're you know just kind of hitting the stick on the ground very characteristic and cartoonishly if they run up the pathway um
Cletus Cobbington 01:00:24 might come on.
Dungeon Master 01:00:37 The cottonwood comes into view. You see there seems to be on sort of the north side of the town towards the mountain, some houses that have burnt down recently. And there is a broken down defense wall. But as you guys land, we'll say on the southern side of town, with a huge flourish, the dust billows up as the wing sort of hit the ground and sort of rest onto your sides. Your forms shift back into yourselves. And there is a group of...
Dungeon Master 01:01:05 If we think about it, there's five of you and then two more. There's a group of seven with one extra body has just landed in a small town. And they all speak Sylvan, as you know. So they're speaking a language that some of you don't understand. But you guys are welcome to Cottonwood.
Cletus Cobbington 01:01:32 I fall to my knees, a tear in my eye. I feel so at home. All these animal folk. What the hell was that? What the hell was that? Sorry.
Zariel Torgan 01:01:39 Ha ha ha ha ha ha. It's like that. What?
Leopold Magnus 01:01:43 But I imagine Cletus lands, his neck is still bow, and I touch the ground, and I go, oh, boy, the eagle has landed. Maybe I, maybe I rang your neck a little too much.
Kaladen Shash 01:01:52 No. What is this massage when you speak of?
Dungeon Master 01:01:55 quack, quack, quack.
Cletus Cobbington 01:02:04 All right. I'm not. Anybody got a massage gun? Fuck. I got a serious crick in my neck. Get it? Crick? There's a crick.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:19 Leo the chiropractor. Leo the chiropractor.
Cyrus Schwert 01:02:20 I'm getting a trick.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:22 It's just a permanent you. Like, Leopold goes, well, I think I might have something in here and I start kind of like punching my arm. Like this like slingshot wrist thing comes out. Oh, well, maybe I'll tinker a bit. We'll see what we can do.
Dungeon Master 01:02:28 Wesley sort of, yeah. Wesley sort of, yeah? Big question. One, two, three.
Cletus Cobbington 01:02:39 slap it against my neck all right well how many of us speak sylvan because i do chip sylvan chip also understands sylvan
Zariel Torgan 01:02:54 I think.
Dungeon Master 01:02:57 And I believe Cowden does the only one who doesn't speak self. Chip on your shoulder also transforms back into a squirrel after being a small runner duck the whole time. Shit, this fucking shit is cool.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:57 I don't understand anything. Chip understands.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:58 I do. Yeah, I do.
Cyrus Schwert 01:03:02 Oh, we're doing pretty good. He can't speak it, but he can hear it.
Cletus Cobbington 01:03:17 He was a little egg. He was in a little egg. Damn straight. This place is magical shit. Stuff a big old almond in his cheek. All right. All right, simmer down.
Leopold Magnus 01:03:27 What is that little mouse squeaking about? He's always going on.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:28 I hope.
Dungeon Master 01:03:31 Fuck you old man. That's pretty good to start sucking on it really loudly. A lot of saliva.
Cyrus Schwert 01:03:36 The word. Stupid. The word there is.
Cletus Cobbington 01:03:48 Like an elderly man with a peppermint. It's a warrior's original.
Dungeon Master 01:03:58 And you guys, Wesley steps out in front and he goes, well, welcome to home, I should say. This is a lovely town of Cottonwood. It's been present for well over 100 years at this point. The only founding member who's still alive is Cornelius. So I do think it's rather urgent for you to talk to him. But yeah, I do apologize. Sir Zario and Sir Leopold,
Zariel Torgan 01:04:18 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:04:26 We've never seen your type before. And you do see at this moment, everybody is staring at the robots. These are a bunch of animals. And the, Cletus, you are, you are blended in. You are, they don't notice you at all. You are the most normal thing they've ever seen. You see some like true cow folk. They're not like,
Cletus Cobbington 01:04:35 Cyrus is too. Tip the straw hat.
Dungeon Master 01:04:48 fur bog technically that they're just like cows that became humanoid over time sort of like give you a general wave as they go back to doing their daily business um yeah you tip your hat to them um you see but all these little kids just like gawk into like the little owlbear tub kid this beak just opens just like staring directly at these robots um you are definitely an eyesore to these people
Kaladen Shash 01:05:08 Thanks.
Zariel Torgan 01:05:11 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:05:13 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 01:05:17 but you have the opportunity. Wesley goes, make yourselves at home. If you don't mind, and he like gestures, he's like, I'm going to take Herb's body to his family. I don't want to involve you in that. It's going to be a pretty sad affair, but I'll check in on you. I hope to find you at Cornelius's place. He is up the creek to the sort of northeast side of town.
Dungeon Master 01:05:46 Find him, I'll join when I can, but he's not expecting you, but he might have some stuff to tell you or reward you for your endeavors and helping us out. Again, very appreciative of it. But I'm going to step out for a bit as he lifts the body of Herb and Darwin kind of helps out because Wesley's not that big and Herb is huge and they sort of
Zariel Torgan 01:06:00 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:06:14 go off into the distance to give you a reassuring nod as they walk away like they're not just abandoning you and you see people generally keep their distance nobody's like crowding you but everybody's staring right you're you're all strangers here they've never seen a person
Cyrus Schwert 01:06:30 It's not super nice to stare. It's all right. Hey, everybody. We're adventurers. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:06:31 So anybody who looks vaguely humanoid like Cyrus and Caledin, the race of the Andubin is, was born in the dome. So you are as alien to them as like a mind flare would be.
Cletus Cobbington 01:06:49 I'll walk in front. We all come in peace. They're all good people.
Kaladen Shash 01:06:52 Des Cyrus, does Cyrus speak? Oh, Cyrus is not up. Your speaker language, hello. You're welcome.
Cyrus Schwert 01:07:01 We're adventurers here. We're just kind of passing through. I'm a normal person, you little freak.
Dungeon Master 01:07:06 This little kid with a snotty nose, little rabbit hair kid with his ears were way too big for his body, just walks up and he goes, ah, what are you? What are you? What's a funny animal ass?
Zariel Torgan 01:07:09 Just. Just start. They're berating the children. You little animals.
Cletus Cobbington 01:07:23 I just slap Cyrus. I want to slap Cyrus so hard for that. Oh, God.
Cyrus Schwert 01:07:32 He's being fucking racist, dude. We should. We should go buy a house in a different town.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:34 What's he saying? Oops, Ariel, it's odd. We're getting lots of looks. Don't you feel the same?
Dungeon Master 01:07:39 Ah, he turns ready, he like hops off. Don't need.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:48 Yeah, I know one thing for sure. We definitely should not talk to Cornelius. I don't think we should follow up on that hint at all. We should probably do something else. You know, we should see what their property taxes are here and just retire. Is there any other competitive almond markets here?
Kaladen Shash 01:07:56 Let us skip the rest. Let's go.
Cletus Cobbington 01:08:08 I look around for a farm. Is there a pre-existing farm here? No. Don't say that. Don't say that.
Cyrus Schwert 01:08:09 Yeah, I do. Blue diamond is here.
Dungeon Master 01:08:14 You see, like, small, like, produce. There's patches of lettuce and they grow, like, natural crops of, like, maize and, like, rice and rice and, like, little water beds, like, nothing large scale, but, like, family to family people trade to each other.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:21 You're fucked. Blue Diamond is here. Oh.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:25 Like the natural, that's his natural enemy. Yeah. Big almond. Yeah. Big almond.
Cletus Cobbington 01:08:40 just like home. My biggest enemy is major corporation farms. Foster Farms is the devil. Well, the big one is Foster Farms. They beat me, even though it's not even the same food group that, you know, it's hard to
Cyrus Schwert 01:08:43 Monsanto really fuss your balls.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:51 Who was eating into your company, your business in the dome? Pletus. Indeed.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:59 Regular milk. Yeah. Yeah. You want to.
Dungeon Master 01:09:06 I need to... I need to be planning that from your farm. Foster Farm equals large corporations. That's chicken.
Cletus Cobbington 01:09:07 be out, it's hard to outshine a major farm. Nuts and berries only do so much against copious amounts of terribly GMOed chicken. All right. It's chicken with an eye.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:21 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:09:27 It's hardly chicken. They had to take the E out and put an apostrophe. It's, you know, to comply with laws, they can't say it's chicken if it's not really that much again. Is, uh,
Zariel Torgan 01:09:39 Hmm. Do we want to, do we want to look around and see if it's like a little shop or something, or do you guys just want to roll forward, figure out what's going on with the...
Cletus Cobbington 01:09:43 All right, I guess. I think it might be a good time to talk to Cornelius. Or do we want to wait for Wesley to group up in?
Dungeon Master 01:09:47 um theories like preachers they all are like mostly furred um the ones who have thicker coats like you see there are like
Kaladen Shash 01:09:56 Cornel clothing.
Cyrus Schwert 01:09:57 What are people, what are these, what are these animals wearing? Is it like they have a vibe in here, are they wearing clothes, normal clothes?
Dungeon Master 01:10:16 There's an owl bear mom and her child that's like representing the picture. They got such a thick coat that they have nothing else on, but they're very bipedal and they move around. But then there's like little tiny rabbit folk who have like little travelers garb on. And you have, I've got a list of the different types that you have.
Dungeon Master 01:10:31 There's some owl folk who just have like a simple tattered robe and like sacks on. There are some otter folk and they don't have anything on because of like they're like very nice clothing. But you see their houses are built like in the crick under like little doors in like the riverbed itself. You see some fox folk.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:51 Do any of the... Is there... Is there any animals wearing other animal fur for clothing? Okay, I was gonna say, what are they making their clothes out of if they're not using animals?
Dungeon Master 01:10:53 who have like very nice clothing and then a cute little hedgehog family sort of like waddles past you all carrying different things, but they don't have clothes on. They just have their little spine sticking out their back. No.
Cletus Cobbington 01:10:59 Oh. Jesus.
Cyrus Schwert 01:11:07 Hmm. Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:11:13 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:11:18 They have some sort of, like, you see some of them have jewelry that has, like, feathering on it, but you, it doesn't, it seems more of like a gift from one to another. It's not like, oh, I deep, I deep feathered and plucked this owl bear when it's sleep and took its fun. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:27 Yeah. Well, I'm just thinking you're like a mink scarf or something. Do they have... Do they have...
Leopold Magnus 01:11:35 uh...
Cyrus Schwert 01:11:36 As we're walking, do we see a store where I can get like a vegan leather bag or something? Like a tote bag. It's vegan leather.
Cletus Cobbington 01:11:44 Do you really think other animals want leather?
Dungeon Master 01:11:47 You see, as you're sort of walking down the path, there is this open shop. It's got a sign hanging from the top, and it says the brusseled, thrush, market, and inn. And inside, I'll tell you, you see there is a, they're known as Cervon, their dear folk.
Dungeon Master 01:12:18 there is um the one standing behind the desk he's got like amorphous like i don't want to describe his hand slash uh hoofs but he it gets around he's fine long sort of short rack sort of nicely uh tarved down and sawed off in certain places to shape into like a nice little crown of horns but um
Cyrus Schwert 01:12:26 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:12:41 this deer sort of greeting just goes, well, Grinching, I am sage, welcome to my inn. See yourself around. All of this is 100% vegan. Of course, we don't, we don't take from other animals here. First and foremost, I should. Because of that, I do charge quite a bit extra level.
Cyrus Schwert 01:12:56 Thank God. Come on, you're making it inaccessible. It's never going to change the culture. Can I, do you have like a vegan leather bag or something that I could buy to carry my wares?
Cletus Cobbington 01:12:59 Very hospitable.
Dungeon Master 01:13:15 Do I ever? He pulls out this beautiful blue brushed vegan leather. It feels nice and soft. It's got good riveting where it's done in. He's like, and I can alter it too. It's either a one-shouldered backpack or a side satchel if you'd like.
Cyrus Schwert 01:13:26 Ooh. Hmm. There's only one shoulder on the backpack. It's like the, oh, I get what you're saying. Right.
Dungeon Master 01:13:46 Well, no, obviously there's two shoulders, but you take off one of them because why would you wear clothes? I'm also getting hints of tread never in there. I like, I like where it's going.
Kaladen Shash 01:13:53 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:13:54 Right, like Channing, Chainham and 21 Jump Street. I'm going to go for the side bag, the messenger sidebag, I think. Yeah, it's evolving. It's definitely, the voice is evolving. I can't be just pathetic the whole time.
Cletus Cobbington 01:14:08 He's getting sass here.
Dungeon Master 01:14:21 Sage sells it to you. It only runs about 10 gold worth of gems. It's a little pricey, but it's not horrible. It's like buying a nice branded backpack. Well, we take gold nuggets. What do you mean gold? I like the shiny rocks, personally.
Cyrus Schwert 01:14:22 Um, what's, what's it's gonna run me? Holy shit. You don't take regular gold?
Cyrus Schwert 01:14:49 Okay, okay, fair. Leopold, could I trade you 10 gold for 10 gold worth of gems? This place is not. Has the...
Leopold Magnus 01:14:59 Oh, well, I wasn't quite sure what you were going on about here, but yes, that does look like a nice bit of wares. And I kind of like shake my arm a little bit, a couple of stones come flying out.
Dungeon Master 01:15:01 he takes it but he takes it but he doesn't take his eyes off of leopold he under his book holy shit what the fuck is that typhus a little bit um you see you like
Kaladen Shash 01:15:02 This is not.
Cletus Cobbington 01:15:07 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:15:19 That's for you.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:28 What did he say? What did he say?
Dungeon Master 01:15:30 Got his head carefully at his side where he's got, like, a stone dagger he keeps just, like, looking very wary. No, actually, you see that none of them seem to work in hard metals. You know from when you met Wesley that he is a scyknife rogue, so his blade manifests through psychic energy. Um...
Kaladen Shash 01:15:37 Jonathan, do they have any metal at all? Do they show any signs of metal working, hinges, door handle? You know what I mean? Okay. Cool. All right.
Cletus Cobbington 01:15:43 I was going to have that too.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:59 What was it 10? Got me. Oh, okay. So I don't need to like, got it.
Dungeon Master 01:15:59 And herb only used obsidian stone axis. So you see it's like very nature-based fay kind of creatures. There's no hard-worked iron or anything. Yeah. Just 10 golds worth.
Kaladen Shash 01:16:10 Yeah. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:16:20 So you got tin gold. I took 10 gold out of my inventory. Hot-stop it. Thanks. It's pretty sweet. Is there any like hedgehog armor? Or chance.
Cletus Cobbington 01:16:32 All right. I was going to ask for some chain mail, but no metal, huh? I brush. I will. A D20?
Leopold Magnus 01:16:43 Jonathan, is it apparent that there's a certain higher class or any stratification and between the different animals?
Dungeon Master 01:16:47 I want me a D20. Whoever wants it. Mm-hmm. No, I'm not going to let that be it though. There's nothing that you can tell. They all, it's all very like hunter-gatherer group effort kind of settlement.
Cyrus Schwert 01:16:50 Me or Cletus? Because it wasn't for me. Damn it.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:50 They don't have an Armadillo helmet. Um,
Cletus Cobbington 01:17:04 Oh fuck.
Leopold Magnus 01:17:16 Okay. There's not like a royal group or something.
Dungeon Master 01:17:17 No, but you, we'll say like you guys spend a couple hours sort of resting, foraging, talking to people, getting to sort of to enjoy the life. They've got like very nice grilled vegetables and stuff, very hearty mushroom steaks. Like you...
Dungeon Master 01:17:35 take a good meal in, somebody offers you some stuff, and everybody seems to sort of point you in the same direction of, um, most people take on the wisdom of Cornelius. He is the town leader. He's also like known as a magic man, like a shaman. He's got some arcane prowess. So people who need him will go to him for some gifts in miracles. And so you ask for a chain mail and somebody kind of gives you a weird look and they're like, well, uh,
Dungeon Master 01:18:05 I don't work with no metal type, but if anybody could tell you what to do or where to go, I reckon it'd be Cornelius. He's never steered me wrong. In fact, he goes on this long story about how Cornelius helped change his wagon wheel one time, totally unrelated, which is right into the story for you. You don't find a Hedgehog armor piece of any kind, unfortunately.
Kaladen Shash 01:18:11 Jonathan Do we? Jonathan? Yeah, I was going to say, are we getting...
Cletus Cobbington 01:18:21 Hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 01:18:22 Oh. Six. Oh, good question. Oh, good question.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:31 So, two things. One, this is definitely a cult. Two, is there like a Pluto and goofy situation where there's animals that aren't sentient that are just like running around? Like, is there like a dog that's walking upright that's walking a dog that's just a straight up dog? There's no animals except.
Dungeon Master 01:18:51 No. No. I don't like that. From the artwork that you had seen, the very crude depictions, it was like, these are animals who, with the gift of something, became like very evolved in humanoid. So there's a natural development of all of this species in this area, but it's not like...
Kaladen Shash 01:18:51 Ha ha ha.
Cletus Cobbington 01:19:07 Good.
Dungeon Master 01:19:16 They have dogs and cats. They're dog folk, cat folk. Oh, let me take care. Oh, there are like small standard birds. Yeah, you hear those all the time. But like we're talking like thrush versus full head height, five, ten, kinku. They're nothing close to each other. And they don't seem to keep any animals.
Zariel Torgan 01:19:19 Yeah. But, yeah. The birds that are chirping are like, hey, what's up?
Cyrus Schwert 01:19:22 But there's no, there's like birds chirping around that aren't like sentient in a way. Okay. Sure. No.
Kaladen Shash 01:19:23 Yeah, John, we're not getting like.
Leopold Magnus 01:19:49 Did we ever closely investigate that book from the archaeologist? Or was there, do we look at that and it was just like one thing?
Dungeon Master 01:19:56 It was just general. I think I gave you a lot. It was like a recount of the era's research. It was mostly written around the war with the mind flares. So it was like this one little civilization that you had sort of stumbled onto this small settlement that was made of stone granted. So there was more advanced working there.
Cletus Cobbington 01:20:11 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:20:21 sort of discussed how there is this nicely utopic type of animal folk who went to war with this alien species that sort of fell from the sky. When they started losing the war they made, they did put all of their intelligence and development into that stone guardian to protect this thing they had devolved. But it was too late and the mind flares had sort of won out. So this seems like if time had been set back sort of planted the ape style,
Dungeon Master 01:20:50 civilization fell and they sort of re-rose and you are sort of seeing a more primitive, simple lifestyle here. Yeah. It's not a lack of intelligence. It's just they have a lifestyle that works and so there's no need to change it.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:59 Got it.
Kaladen Shash 01:21:00 It's not like harmony, though. There's still like bickering between neighbors about like, hey, those are my carrots. You keep out of here. Or is it like harmony? It's not like creepy. Okay. But it's not like creepy harmony and everything's great. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:21:01 Um.
Cletus Cobbington 01:21:11 I'm going to be able to be.
Dungeon Master 01:21:21 No. It doesn't seem like a cult. If it seems like that, it's just because everybody is very simple and you ask for things they've never heard of. And as soon as they hear something that they don't know, they go, oh, go talk to this guy. He can help you. This is...
Leopold Magnus 01:21:33 I'm
Kaladen Shash 01:21:34 Yeah, all right, we're going. Go. He's never, he's never even seeing them. He's never even seeing them. You'll love it.
Cyrus Schwert 01:21:35 Can I ask somebody what if Cornelius has like a favorite snack? Like what's, what is he like? Should we take him a little something? Like a, I don't know, a nut or a berry. We're flush with almonds. What do you think you'd like that? Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:37 Yeah, I'm ready to just...
Cletus Cobbington 01:21:48 What's a stance on almonds?
Dungeon Master 01:21:52 of seed. You see, this is a small, gray, smoky sort of looking herringen, which is a rabbit folk. He's a little kid. He's like, yeah, my name's Ashen as you're talking to him. He goes, I'm this many years old that he holds up four hands
Cyrus Schwert 01:22:08 I didn't... I didn't ask. But does he like snacks or...
Dungeon Master 01:22:22 But you ask him that question, he goes, Cornelius, he's kind of old. And when he was younger, I bet he could have eaten an almond. But those choppers ain't eaten almonds now if you get it, right? So I think he eats lettuce and prone juice. All old people like frume juice.
Kaladen Shash 01:22:39 He liked the almond milk very much. We have gift for him.
Cletus Cobbington 01:22:42 Almond milk, yes.
Cyrus Schwert 01:22:44 You think he wants prune juice? I think we're better off with almond milk, actually. Right. Where can I buy prune juice? Do I have to go back to Sage? I bought this bag, you know? Sure.
Dungeon Master 01:22:54 I actually think that. I think you're wrong, actually. Sage owns the only store in town. Anyway, what are you? Actually, I don't think that's true.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:58 This kid 100% sells
Cyrus Schwert 01:23:13 I'm a normal person. You're the weird one. It's bad. Sacious is back there, right? Okay. Well, can I run back in my produce really quick? Phenomenal. Perfect.
Dungeon Master 01:23:24 Yeah, you're just up the path. When you get some prune juice, it'll cost you an indiscriminate amount of anything. It's such a small amount compared to what you have. He's got a clinking bottle in there.
Cyrus Schwert 01:23:43 I come back, there's one thing in my toe bag. It is previews. Yeah. Okay. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:23:48 We got juice and milk. What could go wrong.
Zariel Torgan 01:23:48 Well, I'll say we'll head down the creek and head north-east.
Dungeon Master 01:24:06 You guys hang up. You go to this little, it gets a little swampy. You hear some loud chirping cicadas and stuff. And the hoots of just the owl folk talking in the distance, sort of making ambient noise. But eventually you make your way up to this old hobbled up, still barely maintained shack.
Dungeon Master 01:24:32 you knock on the door and from within inside you hear you very pleasant oh come in i'll be right there
Cletus Cobbington 01:24:47 I walk in almond milk in hand.
Kaladen Shash 01:24:47 We all,
Cyrus Schwert 01:24:50 You walk in.
Dungeon Master 01:24:52 you open the door and it's this very nice low lit campfire space there are um like sages and rosemary and time and different herbs and spices hanging and drying from the ceiling mushroom stocks drying out the fire is well capped and there's a chair around it a little throw rug made of like hemp and rope sort of quilted and knitted together
Dungeon Master 01:25:16 A small nested bed in the corner, a little table where you see a bunch of writings on what looks like an old school type of parchment made of like fresh, I don't know, whatever they used to make it out of the name escapes me. But like Egyptian style, like very old parchment pirates, yes. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:25:37 Papyrus.
Dungeon Master 01:25:40 And you see this very old figure. He's got bottles hanging from his shell. He's got this old staff.
Dungeon Master 01:25:49 And you do see the first thing you notice, there's an absence of metal in this town completely, with the exception of Cornelius. His staff has like this metal circlet hanging from the top that sort of rattles because it's like put in a knot sort of forged in it. So it's sort of just up and down moves as he kind of hobbles back and forth. He's got little decorative jewelry rings on his shelf. And he is very old in appearance.
Cletus Cobbington 01:26:11 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:26:18 But this is Cornelius Rattleback, a turtle shaman. He hobbles very heavily, his heavy football, studding as the floor creaks underneath his weight. And he goes, and still, well, since I've had new faces, and these sort of chomps down on this dry, toothless sort of maw. I understand why Matt Mercer says it all about it. It's a good word, but, um,
Cyrus Schwert 01:26:19 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:26:43 Hmm.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:43 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:26:47 And he doesn't seem surprised, though. It's like there is a wisdom to his grin he gives. It's like he likes the unexpected and this whole weird group that shows up. And he's sort of leaning on his staff, sort of looking at you and he goes, well, how do I suppose I help you, will folk?
Leopold Magnus 01:27:08 Jonathan, we haven't seen any other similar kind in town. He's like one of one of the only tortoise. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:27:16 No other turtles, no. This is a little. This is a little bit of a stutter you notice he has. He goes, what, uh,
Zariel Torgan 01:27:25 I'm definitely not the one that's gonna talk to him. My charisma's like zero.
Cletus Cobbington 01:27:25 Well. Well.
Cyrus Schwert 01:27:25 I hand him my prune juice. I brought you something. I thought maybe you'd like this.
Kaladen Shash 01:27:36 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:27:44 a guest with a gift that's mighty fond of you and you see he takes his staff and he cracks open the top of the prunes like he's done it a million times and just put his mouth around the top and slowly he doesn't chug it but like it like streams down his wrinkling neck disappearing into the shell as he like spills a little bit that it hits the spot for sure
Cletus Cobbington 01:28:06 If you like that, if you like that, take a hold of this, I give him a chilled mug of lukewarm almond me.
Cyrus Schwert 01:28:08 Oh. You liked that? Okay. That's good. The kid didn't leave me straight. Oh, no longer. Not cold liquid, it's.
Dungeon Master 01:28:13 I love one. It's one of my... It's one of my... I'm having terrible characteristic. Hold on, hold on. I was going for a leavener up. You see Cornelius sort of startles back into his chair. He goes...
Zariel Torgan 01:28:15 It's never going to get clean in there.
Kaladen Shash 01:28:29 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Dungeon Master 01:28:42 My God, is that you milked an almond for this. I used to love almond. I lost means of consuming them when my dentures were lost many moons ago. This is a precious gift indeed. How can I have repaired you? I'm like it.
Cyrus Schwert 01:28:48 You didn't go crazy for the prunes like this. That's not.
Cletus Cobbington 01:28:49 Absolutely, I did. I need some insight on what information we're needing. I am not the one.
Zariel Torgan 01:29:04 I keep giving him liquids. So I keep giving him liquids.
Dungeon Master 01:29:12 sales prune and juice down the street.
Cletus Cobbington 01:29:19 What information are we needing? I keep pouring while one of you talk to them. I refill as well, I refill his mug.
Leopold Magnus 01:29:21 He's going to have to pee. Yeah. Ask him about what happened to the village.
Cyrus Schwert 01:29:22 They just told us to come over here. Everybody told us to come here, but nobody told us what it was for. What? What?
Kaladen Shash 01:29:25 Well, we know the village is having crazy attacks, right? Some fog is bringing in some action. We can find out more about this. We can see if he knows anything about the hag. He's the oldest person. That's good questions. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:29:34 Mm-hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 01:29:47 So I see some burned down walls and such. What's been going on? Oh, this is fresh from the source. This is right here. You'll be fine. Good on the stomach.
Dungeon Master 01:29:49 about halfway out with this old clawed hand over the glass and he goes not too much now I don't want the squirts
Cyrus Schwert 01:29:59 Jesus Christ. This isn't caught with anything. No baby powder. Nothing.
Kaladen Shash 01:30:04 We have.
Dungeon Master 01:30:17 Oh, was there an actual question that was asked? I missed it preparing my squirt remark. Because, you see, this is that grin kind of returns to his face, like a knowing rice smile. He goes, I reckon you were sitting here for such the task. And he sort of,
Cletus Cobbington 01:30:20 I did. Okay. Well, I said, oh, damage to your parameters. What's been going on around here?
Cyrus Schwert 01:30:46 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:30:46 goes back for his chair, he falls into it. For a second, he looks like he's stuck a little bit before he settles down his shell, kind of gets out of his way. He goes, word has traveled to me via my friends. Wesley returned, unsuccessful, unfortunately, but that he brought some guests.
Dungeon Master 01:31:10 And then he goes, again, it's really drawn out. It takes them forever to get to the point stammering and stuffing. But eventually, he sort of lets on that there are these fanatic group of this like,
Cletus Cobbington 01:31:15 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:31:23 Species that tends to be known as pretty crazy. Mechanically, the equivalent of like knolls, hyena, humanoid-type creatures that are blood crazy. They live for the fight. They're very hostile group in general, but they historically lived deep in the Kiyari forest, which he explains is a name derived from an ancient tongue that translates to blood for it. So it's,
Cyrus Schwert 01:31:44 Correct.
Dungeon Master 01:31:50 It was like a very rooted, violent place. And Cornelius doesn't know a whole lot about it. He goes, when I was just a young total, I founded this settlement after my folk were driven out. But, and he continues on taking forever again. But he elaborates that.
Cletus Cobbington 01:31:55 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:32:18 In their culture, there is this mythical figure known as the Great Fire Spirit. It drags the sun into the sky in the morning and pulls it under the horizon at night. Sort of this explanation of the natural phenomenon of the sun rising and stuff. And he says this group has devoted themselves to...
Dungeon Master 01:32:41 sacrificing goods and materials and sometimes people to the spirit on the sort of the base of the mountain um and so they have this thing that has been going on it's less recently but when a heavy fog rolls in and this is the same story you heard but he explains it from the very start
Dungeon Master 01:33:00 this heavy fog rolled down the mountain and this line of fire sort of serpented down the path as these knolls savagely attacked the town taking their stuff they're robbing their crops their boats their carts their goods some people were taken but the hostages weren't the main point and then this is a natural phenomenon now like they're expected to give it up their stuff and these raids to be given to this fire spirit um
Cyrus Schwert 01:33:08 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 01:33:30 And then Cornelius does say, and he goes, now, I am a believer of the natural-based magics, and he sort of draws his finger across his chair and sparks a flame in his claw, saying, I wield some prowess. But what I don't believe necessarily in the gods, there is a very powerful creature that roosts up on that hill.
Cletus Cobbington 01:33:48 Now have you heard of the son. Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:33:59 I believe they worship this creature, believing it to be the great fire spirit. Oh, you saw...
Leopold Magnus 01:34:10 The village, as in they?
Cletus Cobbington 01:34:16 I saw the other day a small sun during the night. Would that relate to this creature? Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:34:27 nights and he asked you about it um and through this dialogue he goes i believe that you have indeed seen this exact creature maybe returning to his roost for the night right i'm uh excuse me that's thrashing my throat um
Cletus Cobbington 01:34:46 Interesting. So it must be of somewhat of truth, then. All right.
Dungeon Master 01:34:57 He goes, like I see it, it's not exactly, like it's based obviously on a real powerful, large, ancient creature, but from my writings and my depictions and my knowledge of general lore and stuff, this is most likely just a naturally occurring creature that they have pledged themselves to.
Cletus Cobbington 01:35:16 Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:35:29 Rather unfortunate for us, they think it's a fire gall. Yes, from what you understand, this town is being, like, regularly ransacked for their good to be given up to whatever this creature is. And then he didn't already tell you, Pletus then reveals to you that he saw some sort of large...
Leopold Magnus 01:35:33 So for clarification, it's the Knowles that have pledged themselves? Okay, I understood.
Dungeon Master 01:35:56 ball of fire fly through the sky during the night's well above the cloud line so it's impossible to make out any discerning shape but in that same sense large enough to be well above the cloud line and be visible like that um cornelius goes on to warn and he says be aware that there's also some
Cletus Cobbington 01:36:12 I'm sorry.
Dungeon Master 01:36:22 I would say lizard folk, they don't come down from the mountain as much, but I do believe the knolls have partnered with them. That's all I would be mighty appreciative of any sort of help to get rid of these.
Dungeon Master 01:36:48 creatures from attacking our town at least uh there's a storm on the horizon i i reckon in three or four days we'll have another attack uh i can only offer you so much goods but mostly information on the lands seeming as you are not from around here
Cletus Cobbington 01:37:00 Hmm. Right.
Kaladen Shash 01:37:12 Do they have any weaknesses? Do you know about this?
Dungeon Master 01:37:19 You know, there are many excursions with them. I know obvious weaknesses other than they only attack at night, so bright lights might not be their best friend. And when they do kill our own, they seem to take great joy in it. And they seem to get a little bit stronger in the scent of blood. So protecting yourselves is a...
Cletus Cobbington 01:37:40 assuming we'll need to get through them to get to said creature
Dungeon Master 01:37:48 utmost importance.
Cletus Cobbington 01:38:05 Well, would we be able to borrow the hand of Wesleyan crew to help guide us and conquer said creatures, or is this something we should do alone?
Dungeon Master 01:38:18 sort of smacks as chomper's for a bit, sets him into his chair back, not so much leaning on his staff anymore, but he just goes, I reckon that's up to him. He's got a special set of skills that he uses to help us get goods from back in time to a lost time of our folk, but he does have a family, and I don't know that he anticipated being in so much harm.
Cletus Cobbington 01:38:50 Well, maybe a scout to help us on our way, but they can go back once we start. That would be much appreciated. Hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 01:38:55 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:39:02 you could probably ask that that much of him he from what I understand and again shoots you a kind of a wry smile he does owe you greatly and he sort of tapped on his staff and he sort of
Cletus Cobbington 01:39:16 Well, we'll take it up with him. See what he has to say. I feel his almond milk again.
Dungeon Master 01:39:27 Activates some magic, and I see a flame sort of goes up on his little wood bone burning stove. It's got like a huge granite slab on it. And he starts on some tea. And he goes, I don't, if anything else I can help you with a happy to. Are you in the need of anything else of us?
Cletus Cobbington 01:39:52 We've heard of a hag that lives on chicken feet. Is this a wife's tale per se, or is this a wife's tale per se, or is this something we can actually chase after?
Zariel Torgan 01:39:53 Oh, we asked about the hang.
Cyrus Schwert 01:39:53 If we want to ask about the hag, I don't know much about it, but it's...
Dungeon Master 01:40:18 Give me a moment. You got to find something. I don't want to call it the wrong thing. Okay. Yeah, so you see another smile again, as if you've asked the right question. And it goes,
Cletus Cobbington 01:40:23 Thank you. Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:40:29 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:40:49 I did expect the random folk to bring this up. Nature has a way of God and us after all. And the lighting lowers a bit. And you see like a green glow just from bioluminescent like moss and stuff that seems to sort of light up behind the walls and stuff and becomes a very magical looking place. And he swirls some dust.
Dungeon Master 01:41:16 that shows like these crude pictures that fade and rise up as he tells this story of, and I'll stop doing in his voice just to get into the story mode of this crone, this mythical creature, the woman of the woods, she's also known, um,
Dungeon Master 01:41:38 to be cruel and twisted offering one-ended deals and bargains to people stupid enough to search her out. But not all evil. She has an empathy for preserving nature. She travels almost interspatially on her, and he describes it, and you don't get out of him. He has at one point in his life, he goes on that,
Cyrus Schwert 01:41:44 Oh.
Cletus Cobbington 01:41:48 One of the people who are you.
Dungeon Master 01:42:06 At my lowest point, I was lost in the woods as a young kid. You hear the creaking of the wood before you hear the footfall of its legs, but her cabin wandered upon me and she offered me hospitality in a time. A clever woman of great magic. She...
Cletus Cobbington 01:42:19 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:42:36 She blessed me with gifts of magic prowess at the cost of that I would outlive anybody I ever loved. So I'm going on my 200th year at this point. No family left. She works in her cruel ways. But I also should be thankful that I've had so much time to learn.
Cletus Cobbington 01:42:50 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:43:01 She introduced herself to me as she called herself the Baba Yaga. Though I do not know where to find her, it's said that she wanders through the forest of death. But if she wishes to find you, she will never met a more powerful woman, I should say.
Cyrus Schwert 01:43:17 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:43:25 Hmm. Let's see. Well, all right. Good to know. Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:43:41 Any specific questions you would ask about that? We can address it. From anybody. He also, I'm going to make a point to include you. I'm going to say you guys were a little bit more hesitant and standoffish. Zareil and Leopold sort of at the perimeter of the room, less comfortable in the space. He sort of looks past Cletus and Cyrus to lead the conversation to the remaining three. And he goes...
Cletus Cobbington 01:44:03 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:44:10 You back there look to have a question. PC.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:17 Oh, what's he saying? I can't understand a damn thing.
Cyrus Schwert 01:44:19 This turtle can't speak common.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:20 Ha ha ha ha ha.
Dungeon Master 01:44:28 He doesn't understand. He gets up and he goes, I understand the dilemma. Now, part of my poor manners. He pours like this juice concocton. He can add some herbs and spices and flashes of magic. And he hands you this potion and taps you on the cheek. And you don't understand anybody. Drink up.
Cletus Cobbington 01:44:35 After.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:51 Oh, okay, thank you. I just splash it into my golet. Well, that was quite strange. Oh, so what did he say?
Dungeon Master 01:44:59 You gain the benefit of tongues. You can... Yeah, you can... You get the benefit of understanding any spoken language. So you can speak with anybody freely at this time. I've got nothing but...
Cletus Cobbington 01:45:06 through the story. Cornelius, why don't you run it back for him now that he understands.
Kaladen Shash 01:45:08 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:45:09 Don't give us the recap version. He needs to hear it all. Wait, where did you get that?
Zariel Torgan 01:45:10 He's just like, so that's about it. Yeah. Word for word for Bata.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:21 Oh. Oh, wow. Oh, well, it was.
Dungeon Master 01:45:27 He drinks some more prune juice, wipes his mouth, sort of stretches his neck out, and then he goes, this is what you gave me. I don't want to get the shit.
Cyrus Schwert 01:45:39 Oh, I thought you drank all that. Okay. All right. Your toolbox.
Cletus Cobbington 01:45:44 He's got to balance out the Alden.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:47 What an interesting story. Well, thank you for repeating all of that. Sorry, gents, for listening again, but any more you can tell us about this forest of death. Seems quite putrid, to be honest.
Dungeon Master 01:46:07 well I haven't wandered up that way some to one I was a young spy adventure like you when he touches like your metal knee because you're so tall and it's just absolutely tapping me like I can move like you could we went all over the place so many things but I lost my friends on that trip to
Dungeon Master 01:46:37 dangers and nature and the such. I do reckon I only ended up in the forest of death because I too was on death doorstep, so to speak, which is also probably why I ran into this crone.
Leopold Magnus 01:46:58 Oh, well, what an interesting tale. This Baba Yaga, what did they look like? Do they shape-shift? Do they hide behind a guise? Or do they come at you truthfully?
Dungeon Master 01:47:17 Many stories exist of her. She might present to you as what you want to see. I myself saw her as just a very elderly tortal folk, long stringy hair, baggy clothes, one eye permanently closed, but the other one never took its eye off of me. Always made eye contact.
Cyrus Schwert 01:47:27 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 01:47:47 burning yellow eyes. She spoke as if she had known me my whole life.
Leopold Magnus 01:47:58 Hmm. Indeed. Oh. But I guess my final question has to do with how you ended up founding this little hamlet here. You said you settled and this came about?
Dungeon Master 01:48:13 knocks the staff on the ground, he goes, yes, I did. I was roughly in my 40th year with my knee running. After I started aging very slowly, I started losing those around me that I cared about. And I journeyed south. Eventually, I found this place and some others came to join me.
Cletus Cobbington 01:48:29 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:48:43 haven we thought of it first until the last couple years or so with the beseeching of the raids
Leopold Magnus 01:48:54 Well, that's quite the story. Thank you. Well, I don't think I have anything else to say. Unless you have some books maybe that I could study or take with me about your culture, that would be interesting.
Cletus Cobbington 01:49:03 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:08 I think...
Dungeon Master 01:49:17 let me do what I have for you. And he sort of filters through some papyrus sort of scrolls, tightly wound, some very old-looking ones. And I'll get you like a list later when I flesh it out. But he gives you like a pretty good stack of general lore history of the town. He gives you what information he can, some like drawn pictures of what he sketched the Baba Yaga's house to look like.
Cletus Cobbington 01:49:42 I don't know. Um, and you know.
Dungeon Master 01:49:44 He, some large, like, hand-drawn pictures of, like, falcons, the thighs of trees and dragon, long-necked serpents. And you had run into one before, but he's got, like, a drawing of a morass, that sort of centipede, monstrous feature that you first encountered. And you can see he's a very well-ended, very old man who's had so much time to gather this information. So he just gives you...
Leopold Magnus 01:50:04 No.
Dungeon Master 01:50:13 A surplus of information. Journal entries, not all of them, but maybe once he finds the entertaining. It's a long process. You guys are just sitting down having tea. The fire is low and crackling. At one point, Leslie drops by. And he goes, Brett, I figured I'd find you sort of about this point. He bows his head and he goes, Cornelius, it's lovely to see you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:50:18 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:50:42 I got... I'm stuck in the stutter, and I have some unfortunate news about our trip, and Cornelia stops them, and he goes, I heard it wasn't as successful in my solences for your friends. They will be missed. And knowing, sort of sad face. And he almost as if he knew he was going to stop, I picks up like a hand-wrapped, like, care package sort of deal. Into the Westland, he goes...
Cletus Cobbington 01:50:50 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:51:12 Give this to Herb's family for me. I do it myself, but it would take me a week to get there, sort of dry, laugh. He says that. Absent-mindly goes back to filtering through some scrolls, and it... You hear... Wesley, jaw drops. Uh...
Leopold Magnus 01:51:25 I suppose Tucker's chopped liver.
Dungeon Master 01:51:45 I don't even know what to say to them. I'm so brutal. Cornelius just goes, like not even facing you, just goes, I suppose it's more alarming to see the dead form of your partner than to not see them at all.
Cyrus Schwert 01:51:45 He doesn't know how to respond. He doesn't even know what to respond. That was awesome.
Cletus Cobbington 01:51:48 Lost for words.
Leopold Magnus 01:52:06 Oh, okay. Well, I would maybe ask Tucker's family that, but it's up to you. Anyhow, one final question. Any advice if we talk to the hag, if you had one thing to say. Oh, taken to heart. Thank you very much.
Dungeon Master 01:52:22 Chances are she knows the answer to your question. So lying through your teeth might result you losing them. Of course. Because I don't know that I can help all of you. And he's very admiring as you have more worked metal on
Cletus Cobbington 01:52:26 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:52:51 your persons than I have in my entire house. And he singles out Zareal and Cleetus. And he goes, I do find myself very proficient in the ways of nature if I could help either of you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:53:14 Sure. I wouldn't pass down a helping hand.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:15 I mean, if you have any suggestions,
Dungeon Master 01:53:21 He goes, let me see what I have. Sort of looking through some various things. The first thing he gets, he hands you guys like a handful, maybe four standard bottles. And he goes, these herbal salves should take the edge of any pain that you have. And he hands you four regular healing potions.
Cletus Cobbington 01:53:47 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:53:48 And he goes, well, I don't have as much as I thought, but I suspect you seem less interested in helping a free will. And I understand that, but I'll make you a deal. In exchange for, let's say, a handful of gems for every ear of a knoll you bring me up.
Kaladen Shash 01:53:49 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:54:19 I will, in addition, gift you my staff if you take care of our problem for us. We're losing goodwill and fighting men, and I don't know how much longer we can hold off if we were to lose our fighting force.
Kaladen Shash 01:54:23 You know.
Cletus Cobbington 01:54:38 Well, hard to pass that one down. Sounds like a deal to me. Tap my little hat.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:42 Yeah, I imagine that's a good deal.
Dungeon Master 01:54:47 Shakes out, holds out his like tortal clawed hand. He goes, uh, consider ourselves business. Prune juice and almond milk for the house. Of course, uh, equal parts. So it's one part almond milk, one part prune juice. And in each glass, uh, milky purple concoction. It curdles instantly.
Cyrus Schwert 01:55:06 Oh. This is an almond palmer. It's absolutely an almond palmer. I'm an almond palmer. I'm pretty a golfer drink it. I'm pretty sure.
Kaladen Shash 01:55:06 Oh, purple. Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Cletus Cobbington 01:55:09 Oh, I, I whiffed it like a shock.
Dungeon Master 01:55:20 Bomber. Gonna write that down. I know. I invented the game of 50 or so years ago.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:20 Almond palm. Nice. That's good.
Leopold Magnus 01:55:23 Oh, an almond palmer. Oh, Jesus.
Cyrus Schwert 01:55:45 That is incredibly interesting, and you left that out for a while. That's fair. But what we have done is established that there are sports in this world, so that's nice. That's canon now. So I can't take that back. Really?
Dungeon Master 01:55:50 It didn't seem like it was relevant to the death in the story we were telling. I'm an avid pickleballer myself now that I can't golf as much. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:55 It came up organically. Yeah. Also, and more mobility's down, so pickle is where it's at.
Cletus Cobbington 01:56:07 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:56:18 How many courts did we see in town? D4. All right. Or pickleball courts? Or are they occupied? Here the pickling. The ball's bouncing.
Dungeon Master 01:56:19 I just kind of roll me a D4. This is a small settlement. If there are four pickable courts that took over old farmsteads.
Cyrus Schwert 01:56:22 A D4 plus 20. Yes.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:24 Oh, you should have made it a D12. I was going to say, yeah. They're all over the blade. Oh, man. Oh, man. That's the nail in the coffin. Oh, man. That's the nail in the coffin. We're getting them now.
Dungeon Master 01:56:44 One of them built down recently in a raid, though, so down to three, unfortunately. Cornelius says, feel free to stay in my guest house out back for the night, free of charge, of course. See me in the morning, I'll send you up with a blessing if you wouldn't mind.
Cletus Cobbington 01:56:49 Oh.
Cyrus Schwert 01:56:52 That's just too bad.
Cletus Cobbington 01:57:12 While we have Wesley here, why don't... I want to ask him if he would mind scouting us up to the hill where the Nolz village is. Or maybe if one of you wants to...
Zariel Torgan 01:57:13 Yeah, I think that's good.
Dungeon Master 01:57:29 I thinks it over for a second. No, you owe him pretty good, especially saving his life and everything. He doesn't think it over very long before he goes, no, I do reckon that I quite owe you for sure. When do you guys need my assistance? I haven't been all the way up to the mountain myself, but.
Dungeon Master 01:57:59 I figure I could get you most of the way, at least. No, honestly, I've known you all for only about three or four days at this point, but you're more capable than anybody I've ever met.
Cletus Cobbington 01:58:02 I trust you're much more familiar with this forest than we are. So any help will do. And no push on fighting with us. Just get where we need to go and we'll carry from there.
Dungeon Master 01:58:24 I mean, hell, I don't even know that this one can be killed. He points past Cyrus to Leopold and Zario.
Cyrus Schwert 01:58:33 Talking about me? You must be talking about me.
Dungeon Master 01:58:41 But then you guys have the opportunity to talk if you need to. If you want to have some side conversations, we can't otherwise. It'd be another long rest. Nothing happened today. Nobody spent any spells. So just into the next morning, you guys get a long rest in. And you all report back to Cornelius. He takes a long time to wake up and he stretches out of his shell.
Dungeon Master 01:59:02 sort of addresses himself and he gives you sort of like this red clay mud and he sort of draws a little symbol on each of your foreheads that burns brightly for a second before fading down and you gain everybody um gains a death ward and a blessed that is valid for the full days travel uh cornelius did you are
Kaladen Shash 01:59:26 Could you just put that on with? Or near this, sorry, yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:59:26 Death Ward Cornelius did. Yeah, what's that? Okay. And then blasts, can you remind? Okay. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 01:59:30 Chris. Nice. Nice.
Leopold Magnus 01:59:32 What does a death ward do? Oh. That old fart better not kick the bucket while we're out venturing.
Dungeon Master 01:59:35 If you were to drop to zero hit points, you instead drop to one. Bless is a D4 to attack rolls and saving throws. And his is good for a day. So unless Cornelius dies, you guys have a day's worth of less.
Cyrus Schwert 01:59:57 That old butt that's going to fart, though. I break my ribs on his shell. Oh, oh.
Dungeon Master 02:00:01 He starts choking on a whole almond that he found in Cletus's bag. As he's choking, you go to give him the high-like maneuver, but his shells so hard, you can't really compress his chest.
Leopold Magnus 02:00:08 Oh, that hags magic better not wear off now.
Kaladen Shash 02:00:09 No.
Cletus Cobbington 02:00:24 Oh, Chip scurries into a shell and slaps his back from it within. I reach into the fire and grab a burnt slobery all in.
Zariel Torgan 02:00:24 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 02:00:30 resting on his back. Eventually the almond ejects into the fire and it explodes. And you see Chip looks at the Ahmed explosion in the fire. He looks at Euclides and he goes, I want that. I made up my mind. I want that. No, no, no, no. I want that.
Cyrus Schwert 02:00:37 Jesus Christ.
Leopold Magnus 02:00:41 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:00:53 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 02:00:55 slap it in his cheek. Oh. Oh. Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:01:00 I want almonds that explode. Can you make that happen for me? I think I'd just be a way better part of this team. So far, I just kind of hang out and eat almonds. But, like, if I could blow up almonds, imagine how he grabs you very, like, at your, like, lapels, pulls you down. He goes, Cletus, I want you to picture me with little almonds. And everybody just hears...
Cletus Cobbington 02:01:26 I'm picturing it real good. We both, like, little children, whipped to Leopold. So Leopold. This gun we were talking about. How long would it be? Can Chip do a check? Do it.
Cyrus Schwert 02:01:26 Really focusing on this.
Dungeon Master 02:01:32 Chip congers over and leans on your leg and he thinks he won't. If this is bad, it doesn't count. That's how it works for Chip. He does fine. He looks.
Leopold Magnus 02:01:43 Oh, well, I could probably whip it up.
Kaladen Shash 02:01:48 All of this.
Cletus Cobbington 02:01:58 Honorary plus 10. Ha ha ha ha. That's like a little marksman.
Cyrus Schwert 02:01:58 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 02:02:01 yeah he just kind of he doesn't get involved in combat so he's got plot armor at this point uh chip sort of gestures up after pleitas says this and some gestures and you hear in as you can't he's like he's like yeah i figure if it gets a stock i could like shoulder it real well this is this is coming together
Leopold Magnus 02:02:19 He's doing gun charades. Well, I start showing chip all my drawings that I've been working on. And I show them, there's the double barrel one. There's the tactical firearm. There's lots of options.
Cyrus Schwert 02:02:35 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:02:38 Well, well, I think a raffle of sorts would be best just to give some range. So we don't have to be point blank.
Dungeon Master 02:02:46 That's up to trace. Is there one that's a little more appealing?
Leopold Magnus 02:02:47 As I'm asking me, is there one that you'd like more than another here?
Cletus Cobbington 02:03:09 since rain better for a healer. I don't get up too much. Chip, what do you think? A rifle? I got one back home. Or the farm to the east has one at least. But we want an almond-powered rifle here, all right?
Cyrus Schwert 02:03:16 What are these words you're saying? Shotgun rifle, what the hell? What do you know about all this? Oh my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Dungeon Master 02:03:38 Please.
Cletus Cobbington 02:03:39 Blast some fuckers away.
Leopold Magnus 02:03:42 Okay, yes, well indeed, yeah. And I just start leafing through these, I put them in the chat here, but, you know, leafing through them. I've got this one here. It has a scope, so, you know, you can zoom, get some nice magnified optics. This one here, it shoots almonds and acorns, you know, whatever you'd like to chamber it with.
Kaladen Shash 02:03:46 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:03:49 It's too good.
Leopold Magnus 02:04:08 It's probably a little bit closer up and that this one here is maybe a mid range.
Cletus Cobbington 02:04:16 Let's go with the mid-range. And all the milk.
Dungeon Master 02:04:17 Go ahead. Go through that as you eat your breakfast, simple porridge and stuff. Cornelius tells you just wild stories from his youth. He also founded basketball. You find out. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:04:36 That is crazy. That's crazy. There's no way you could jump. There's no way. How do you know? I could be older than you.
Leopold Magnus 02:04:36 I think this guy just tells a lot of tall tales.
Kaladen Shash 02:04:37 Real pioneer. Real pioneer.
Dungeon Master 02:04:41 I can't do it anymore, but I could get up in the air at one point in my time. Sonny, don't tell me what I could and couldn't do. I've been doing it since before you were born. I doubt it.
Cletus Cobbington 02:04:46 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:01 Ha.
Cyrus Schwert 02:05:06 Retinal's a hell of a drug. That's a bad.
Dungeon Master 02:05:11 Can't use it. It reacts poorly to my skin. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, you still have, you still have all the classifications of your race.
Cletus Cobbington 02:05:18 Quick side question, Jonathan. Since I am of, you know, we're all the same technical. Do I, am I still technically verbal age limits or am I like that race? Okay. All right, well. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:05:41 Can we take a quick like two to five for a second?
Dungeon Master 02:05:45 Yeah. Take a quick milk break.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:51 Sounds good.
Cletus Cobbington 02:05:52 That works.
Kaladen Shash 02:05:53 Yeah. Do you put them in the chat? That's the one problem I was having in the chat.
Leopold Magnus 02:06:01 Yeah, Brin, I just made some new images of light splitter. Yeah, it actually generated the whole sword from help to. Well, these are pretty interesting. It sounds like kind of like bits of
Leopold Magnus 02:06:32 like crystal rather than like stained glass panes. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:06:40 Yeah, that bits of crystal is almost kind of more what Jonathan describes as they're kind of loosely holding together to make a sword, not like they're, you mean like it's multiple, right? Because he describes it as like a thing that has like light to it, but each shard is actually not like touching. It's like just held perfectly in place. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:07:02 Right. Yeah. Now this other image generator site, I think is generally better than the other one I was using. Which one is that? Which one is that?
Kaladen Shash 02:07:16 You know. Um, if you ever go over to West Side Tavern? It's off of like 14th before it turns into Cascade. Most Century. It's a dive bar, man, but they've got great, great fried chicken.
Leopold Magnus 02:07:34 Yeah, I think I might. Ah, man, I haven't been in there, but it looks like a fun dive bar, just kind of like with goal and stuff. Really? Okay. Yeah, I know. I mean, I've walked by there a number of times. I always saw Megan, I was like, I want to go in there and check that out. She's like, it's not her vibes. So she's always like, no, I'm not going in there.
Kaladen Shash 02:07:48 yeah do we should check we should go get some fried chicken sometime yeah so the people the people that own that own that
Leopold Magnus 02:08:04 Yeah, absolutely. I'm down. Get a beer, a place of pool, get a fried chicken. I didn't know that they actually had like decent food. I mean, you wouldn't really necessarily expect that. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:08:19 Also own Lifties, if you've ever been to that little bar restaurant thing. Yeah. West Side Tavern. Yeah, well, because Westside and Lifties have the same chicken tenders, but Lifties doesn't do like the whole fried chicken pieces. Good, they're good.
Cyrus Schwert 02:08:26 Are you talking about Drake? Yeah. Okay. Have you guys had Cascade West fried chicken? Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:08:29 That's pretty funny, because, like, those are totally different places. Right. Yeah, so let's go in there. Let's play some disc golf. I don't think so.
Kaladen Shash 02:08:50 Yeah, have you ever been, Travis? Yeah. It's really good fried chicken. Yep.
Cyrus Schwert 02:08:58 It is. It's just good dive bar, just grease. But in a good way. I say that loving me. That would be fun. I've been sneaking in as many holes that I can after work every day. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:09:08 I was going to say, yeah, we should play some disc golf. Then we can roll in there for a beer and chicken after. Yeah, days are getting just ever so slightly longer. It's noticeable to the point where it's like, yeah, you're getting off at five. And you're like, OK, get a little more light.
Cyrus Schwert 02:09:34 Yeah, exactly. Just waiting for the time when you can go disc golfing and then go paddle the river in the same day all after work. Yeah, miss that.
Kaladen Shash 02:09:36 Yes, those are the best days. Yeah, when you're... Rex, remind me... Yeah, remind me what race or what are you getting ready for?
Leopold Magnus 02:09:43 That would be sick. Yeah, I mean, I've been trying to run a lot more. It's kind of nice, sometimes getting a good look at the stars, but I wish it was daylight when I got off work. Oh, yeah, it's this thing called Trans Rockies, man. It's...
Leopold Magnus 02:10:08 Six days, 120 miles, I think. Well, yeah, I mean, I thought I was initially going to, like, do a team event, but the way I ended up registering was solos. But my cousin is also running. So, but I don't know if we'll end up running together if she's going to be, like, ready to throw down or not. I've been putting in the work, so I don't know if she's not going to.
Kaladen Shash 02:10:16 and you're on team right? Right. So you said,
Cyrus Schwert 02:10:38 Are you like a long distance runner historically? Okay. That's an incredibly long. That's an incredibly long.
Leopold Magnus 02:10:41 uh no no not at all uh 120 miles six days yeah it's it's fucking brutal man each age is like 20 thousand feet or at 2,000 feet yeah i mean yeah exactly yeah it's like 15 20 miles a day yeah so
Kaladen Shash 02:10:45 Yeah, so I thought you said. So did you say 126 in six days? What you said? Okay, okay. All right, man. So, yeah, you're, yeah, you're, yeah. Yeah, you're one. You can handle it. That's, I've, I've never, I've never run that, but I've backpacked those links pretty easily for that, that many days.
Dungeon Master 02:10:46 What are you talking about?
Leopold Magnus 02:11:12 Yeah, that was exactly my thought. Yeah, I backpacked, done a lot of miles, you know, 15, 20 mile a day's with like a huge pack. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, I'm not like starting from scratch. Like I run probably like, I don't know, three, four times a week. But I've never necessarily trained. So it's in August. So.
Kaladen Shash 02:11:16 Yeah, you can walk jog station to station, camp to camp, whatever they got set out. When is your race, when is this? Oh, Brad, that's cool.
Dungeon Master 02:11:17 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:11:43 I got plenty time. Yeah, I'm ramping it up. I'm trying to. Yeah. No, I'd be, I'd be down. Yeah. Yeah, well, the dogs pull me. It's like a sled. I'm the sled and they're, you know, they're the sled dogs.
Kaladen Shash 02:11:46 That's good. I'll go in some jogs. I'll go in some jogs with you, but I won't go on your super long ones. Cooking it. Oh, man, yeah. Gee, they would go.
Dungeon Master 02:11:52 And the one time I saw Rex running, he was just kind of falling. It was faster than just a dog. Yeah, well, with his dog. I'm not talking about that one time. You did come back from sprinting after Arlo with not all. You weren't incredibly winded. You did fine. That was pretty impressive. And you must have made it at least a mile. Your voice got so distant.
Cyrus Schwert 02:11:57 after his dogs.
Leopold Magnus 02:12:16 Yeah. I was really fucking worried he was gone. And I was like, I'm going to get so much trouble. Yeah, yeah. He was scared. He was fucking scared. He was like, yeah. He's pretty good. I mean, yeah. But I worry sometimes like that, especially because he gets his mind on something. He's just, so.
Kaladen Shash 02:12:18 He knew it. He knew it. That's funny. That's funny. Jonathan, you should look at the chat again. Jonathan, you should look at the chat again.
Dungeon Master 02:12:23 I love that he just came back behind you. He looped around and we just went.
Kaladen Shash 02:12:48 Rex loaded in a couple more like light splitters yeah yeah yeah there's the one that's like sort of crystally glass yards yeah yeah that's so yeah it's fun though i was like oh it's cool
Dungeon Master 02:12:49 I was listening. I had my ear piece in the whole time. I was just muted when I was outside. They're pretty sick. That crystal one is, I think, the closest it's gotten. Because normally if you say like separate them, for some reason it like throws the pieces in different ways and stuff.
Cletus Cobbington 02:12:54 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:12:57 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you're trying to get it just right. I was trying to think of other things I could.
Dungeon Master 02:13:15 I like that there's one individual weapon that you guys just keep remaking over and over again. That makes me very happy. I think you should put more work into like making a Leopold. Because you got almost close, but your character art, I think is the least specific to your character.
Leopold Magnus 02:13:28 try to try to make this uh yeah that's a good point yeah yeah definitely well and the one that's on d and d beyond was just like uh i think it came from a google search it wasn't even like uh image generator thing
Cletus Cobbington 02:13:32 Thank you. Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:13:58 Like, you could just ask, I've done it, like chat GPT, you can say make me an image of this. I want to see if it does a good one for maybe Cletus. Maybe like Dolly or something.
Leopold Magnus 02:13:58 So, right. This, so that carrier AI seems like it uses a pretty good model. It's fast. I have no idea. But it's crazy fast. It's image is like almost instantly, even if on the free account.
Cletus Cobbington 02:14:11 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:14:20 You're going to say I had some fun with that one.
Dungeon Master 02:14:32 I can tell that I'm stoked now. I can't think of basic things.
Cyrus Schwert 02:14:37 Okay, I'm ready. You want to come in here? Okay, okay. Okay. Another name.
Leopold Magnus 02:14:37 Uh-huh.
Zariel Torgan 02:14:39 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 02:14:41 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:15:09 Oh, hey dear. So sweet.
Dungeon Master 02:15:10 I went out of... Well, I asked it to make a picture of your character, and they made him buff. He's jacked. Hold on. Let me get into the Discord from my computer.
Cyrus Schwert 02:15:12 Yeah, bud.
Cletus Cobbington 02:15:12 I'm going to be.
Kaladen Shash 02:15:26 You know.
Leopold Magnus 02:15:28 It's like rips. Is robot bod is jacked? Oh, okay.
Dungeon Master 02:15:41 No, sorry, it's, um, Cletus. Let's see if I can post it. There. He's fucking hot.
Cletus Cobbington 02:15:49 Oh shit. I got the Riz. Thanks. So, like, not very cow. Which is why it's attractive.
Kaladen Shash 02:16:00 Okay. All right. All right. All right. No.
Zariel Torgan 02:16:02 Damn. Like, hotter than a normal one. Mm-hmm. See if I can make one.
Cyrus Schwert 02:16:02 Dude, you're kind of hot.
Leopold Magnus 02:16:05 Yeah, dude. Yeah, you're like a pretty hot cow, dude.
Dungeon Master 02:16:15 No, it was the first run, but then it told me that I reached my limit for the day because I did some stuff earlier. So I have to stop it there, unfortunately. Yeah, that's right. I do it for basic stuff, but there's other ones that give you more options, more image generated, like tokens to do it per day.
Cletus Cobbington 02:16:20 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 02:16:30 Is that just on chat, GBT, or where are you on that?
Kaladen Shash 02:16:33 Yeah. Like right underneath the squirrel guns.
Leopold Magnus 02:16:43 Jonathan, if you scroll up in the chat, I put one and it's that Korea AI. It'll let you generate a lot more images. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:17:06 I do see it. Cool. Not as important. I was just screw around. Were you ready? Okay, as you guys make your way out of town, you exits. See, I had something prepared just in case.
Cletus Cobbington 02:17:11 Yes, sir.
Zariel Torgan 02:17:16 Yes.
Leopold Magnus 02:17:18 Yep.
Cyrus Schwert 02:17:22 been
Dungeon Master 02:17:39 You guys make your way through the side of town. There's like broken down barriers and stuff, but you make your way. And eventually you're just walking through the open plains towards the mountains. So you are very slow progress, careful walk. You chat with Wesley. You can tell who is sad, but excited to be out on another adventure. You can tell he enjoys the stuff. But you guys...
Cletus Cobbington 02:17:41 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:18:08 As you follow sort of the waterway up, you are, sorry, heading east, not north. Would you guys like to do anything? You know it'll only take, it'll be like less than a day to get there because these raids seem to happen pretty quickly once the mist rules in. Who wants the roll? Do you have the day goes? The survival check.
Cletus Cobbington 02:18:37 uh i have pretty good survival but i'm pretty sure serial does too sure we have a plus eight nice
Leopold Magnus 02:18:38 Oh, terrible at survival.
Zariel Torgan 02:18:45 Yeah, I could do it. Do you want to just survival? Yeah. Yeah. 25.
Cyrus Schwert 02:18:46 Yes. Is it?
Dungeon Master 02:18:56 What if I? You just roll well in general. Day goes great. You make really good speed and the weather stays clear, which is you find important. It means that the continent wind's not going to get sacked while you're away that used, you can tell. But as you make your way up, unless you guys want to talk about anything, you get to...
Cletus Cobbington 02:19:10 Thanks.
Cyrus Schwert 02:19:18 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:19:29 We'll just do this general one first. Just to give you something to look at. The terrain starts to change pretty drastically. The elevation increases more rapid. You're going steeper and steeper up. And then there are some points that you are like hands and feet sort of,
Dungeon Master 02:19:56 scaling before you find a pretty clear cut path that seems to head deeper into the sort of jagged area surrounding the mountain. You're getting higher. There's just natural cloud gathering at some point. You get so high that you're not above the clouds, but you're sort of seeing mist sort of eye level and sort of gets a little bit harder to see farther out unless you're looking straight down.
Dungeon Master 02:20:19 And eventually, you guys, there's a really good survival check. So you get the jump on it. You do see past the mountain there is a fog rolling in, but you've got some time before it hits. But you hear some commotion, um,
Zariel Torgan 02:20:19 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:20:36 above sort of up on the path coming towards you you haven't been noticed but you see there are multiple and this map is not the scale yet so where you guys are and where they appear are not going to be that actually that close but you see there is a group of these um sort of lizard like uh
Zariel Torgan 02:20:54 Hmm?
Dungeon Master 02:20:59 small like three to four feet at the tallest wearing worked metal chain mill cloth clothing um there seemed to be having a snarky conversation with each other does anybody speak trachonic
Cletus Cobbington 02:21:06 No.
Leopold Magnus 02:21:17 No.
Cyrus Schwert 02:21:22 Um, I
Dungeon Master 02:21:22 No, you don't understand what they're saying. They seem to be speaking in a language you don't, you haven't heard before. You guys have the surprise on it. You guys, if you want, can hide, you can prepare, you can go around, however you want to handle this.
Zariel Torgan 02:21:35 So it's.
Dungeon Master 02:21:42 It's a pretty narrow path. You could probably scale down to hide if you didn't want to engage or you can get into certain positions behind like rocks and stuff if you wanted to prepare for combat. But you guys have an action or two depending on what you want to do.
Cletus Cobbington 02:22:03 I could pass without trace if we wanted to sneak around a little better or we can take the fight. What say y'all? This is true. Yes.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:21 I mean, I mean, we're here to kill these fuckers, right? I mean, we want as many ears as possible. Yeah, I say we fuck them up. Yeah. Ha ha. Ha ha. Yeah, I'm ready to rock on.
Kaladen Shash 02:22:31 That's right. Keep the money. Let the games begin. I all get three. Six of them right now.
Cletus Cobbington 02:22:34 All right.
Cyrus Schwert 02:22:47 How many of them are there? Okay. And how far would you say? Right. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:22:50 Oh, you see six. The map shows that they're only like 20 feet from you, but they're walking towards you. Let's say they get 30 feet per round. You have about two rounds worth of action. They're closer to 60, but they're going to hit a point where they hit the center of the map. Where do you guys want to be when that happens?
Leopold Magnus 02:23:09 It's a pretty steep cliff. It's a pretty steep cliff, or is that just an artifact of the map?
Zariel Torgan 02:23:17 I'll just get, try to get line of sight. I guess I'm pretty tall, so I'll stand like over here, in the middle maybe.
Dungeon Master 02:23:33 Yeah. It would be, it's very steep. To fall might be your death kind of deal.
Kaladen Shash 02:23:34 Yes, that looks, it looks.
Leopold Magnus 02:23:43 Yeah, okay. I am going to take out something that hasn't been used in a long time. Toss it over here near the edge cliff called the duty maker. And then Leopold's going to kind of try and shuttle his way just out of sight underneath the cliff's edge and hide right here.
Cyrus Schwert 02:23:47 Check.
Zariel Torgan 02:24:04 Yeah, if we're attacking, probably not.
Dungeon Master 02:24:14 Okay, then give me a stealth check. Is pass without a trace being cast? Okay, then just give me a normal stealth checking with, that's with disadvantage with you, correct?
Cletus Cobbington 02:24:23 I mean, I thought we were just fighting them. So no, I don't think so.
Kaladen Shash 02:24:27 Yeah, we're fighting. He didn't, he didn't, he didn't, he didn't, he didn't, that's not so.
Leopold Magnus 02:24:38 Yep. A long rest, right?
Dungeon Master 02:24:43 Okay, seven. You probably feel as though you're mostly hidden, but again, you are a large shape. So you're not totally sure. Who else is doing something? That's one down. Yeah, you guys are at full everything.
Cletus Cobbington 02:24:57 Wow.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:01 Um, I guess, um, I'll, I'll shoot out a sacred flame, which would be just a deck save if we're just curling. No, no, I'm just, this is my action. I'm going to have the trigger for when we're known. That way it'll go off then.
Dungeon Master 02:25:12 Okay, so are you going to wait until the second round then? Are you letting them know you're there around early? Right. You have two actions, right?
Cyrus Schwert 02:25:28 We're going to be actually.
Dungeon Master 02:25:31 You have something you can do before that. If you have a buff or if you want to get in a certain spot, like strategically, and then on the second round, they'll enter this space and you can set things off. Do you want to do anything before the sacred flame? Okay. Beautiful. And so you're holding that sacred flame. Who's next?
Zariel Torgan 02:25:45 Um, I guess I'll just move over over to the side by the edge. Because I can always fly if I get knocked off, so I'll be the closest to the edge over here.
Kaladen Shash 02:26:01 I'm going to cast mere image, and then I'm going to hold the second round. I'm going to hold probably just my bonus action, or that'll just be my attack, the two oest object blasts.
Dungeon Master 02:26:19 Okay. Cletus, do you do anything? Okay, true strike on Cobald Dragon Shield number four.
Cletus Cobbington 02:26:25 Um, hmm. I don't think so, honestly. I think I'm good.
Cyrus Schwert 02:26:37 I'll cast tree strike on the one that's closest to us. Perfect. No. No.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:48 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:26:57 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:26:57 Okay, Cyrus, anything else? Okay. Then everybody go ahead and roll an initiative. And then if you were holding a spell or something like that, go ahead and unleash that at the start of the turn and let me know who you're hitting when you do it. But we'll go in the same initiative order, but a surprise round essentially.
Kaladen Shash 02:27:25 Jesse does it the best. That's fine. Let's do that. This is more of what I had in my head.
Cletus Cobbington 02:27:28 Nat 20. Oh, yeah. That's great.
Zariel Torgan 02:27:29 Just... Just, you know? Just a fun guy. Just a fun guy. I'll hit the guy up front. If we can choose.
Leopold Magnus 02:27:30 Work.
Cyrus Schwert 02:27:41 Jesus. Jesus. It is good.
Dungeon Master 02:27:57 OK. Roll the hit down there. Deck save 16. 15 fails.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:00 It's a deck save, actually. Deck Save 16. Ooh. This is radiant damage. I don't know if that makes any difference. Oh, ouch. Not cool.
Cyrus Schwert 02:28:11 Brutal.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:19 It could have been better. It could have been better. It's okay. Yeah. Did.
Cletus Cobbington 02:28:21 Um.
Dungeon Master 02:28:27 It doesn't have anything to radiant one way or the other. Okay, four damage. Okay, and then Caledon had the esoptic blasts.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:49 Cyrus cast, true strike? Is that for everybody to get advantage? Is that just him? Okay, fair now. What's your sign? And put both on the first one. I don't know if 14's enough, and then the second one, probably enough? 17. So one hits, here we go. There's also a four.
Dungeon Master 02:28:56 That's for him and it's for a melee attack. 14 misses, 17 hit. Nice rolls, guys.
Cyrus Schwert 02:28:57 Great.
Kaladen Shash 02:29:20 Beating him up. Just let him get his attention.
Cletus Cobbington 02:29:22 I mean, we're straight up tacking these fuckers, eh? Um, I want, are they, are any of them within five feet of each other?
Dungeon Master 02:29:25 Then it'll be. Oh, that's a little out of order. Cletus, are you doing anything as a surprise? You're going to wait until they're past? Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:29:52 Can I get like three of them? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:29:54 That one's 10 feet. Those two are together. That one's 10 feet. Okay, you have two sets of five feet. The ones that are like next to each other are each within five feet, but they're all 10 feet apart technically per, like the ruler. So each line is too far away, but each grouping is close.
Cyrus Schwert 02:30:00 Yeah, it did.
Cletus Cobbington 02:30:21 Well, I want to try to hit the two standing next to each other with a second level moonbeam. OK. Radiant. So they got to make a con check.
Dungeon Master 02:30:37 What kind of damages Moon Beach? Is it radiant? It's... It's... It's... That's why.
Cyrus Schwert 02:30:49 Stevenson.
Cletus Cobbington 02:30:52 Hell yeah. The grouping closest to us.
Dungeon Master 02:31:01 That's the point stage out of those two. Which two did you want to do it to? The first grouping and the second grouping. Alrighty, that is that guy and that guy.
Kaladen Shash 02:31:02 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:31:24 Yeah. DC 15. OK. Jesus. OK, they rolled well. OK, so they take half this.
Dungeon Master 02:31:34 First one gets a 16. Second one gets a 20. 30-20. Yes, they do. Two damage. Three damage. Three damage each. Round up.
Cyrus Schwert 02:31:37 No. You know.
Cletus Cobbington 02:31:53 Oh, perfect. It rolled awesome. Wait, did that roll two? Oh, my God. This is awesome, guys. Fuck. All right. I think that's it. Great job.
Kaladen Shash 02:32:00 yeah everybody's on it everybody's doing it we're just we're just yeah give me false false sense of superiority that's all
Zariel Torgan 02:32:06 We're just kicking ass to start. We rolled up and started kicking them in the shins.
Cyrus Schwert 02:32:09 freaking. You guys brought the freaking. Um, how far aware are they? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:32:15 Okay, anything else on your really nice turn? Good job, man. Cyrus, your surprise around action. The map is to scale. So dragging near, do you guys see it? Okay, cool. Yeah, it's awful scale. Those are five-foot tiles.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:38 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:32:39 Thanks.
Kaladen Shash 02:32:39 Yeah. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:32:40 It's to scale. Okay. Okay, perfect. Can I, is it doesn't, it doesn't feel like a surprise round if I just run at him, but is that an option in theory? I mean, yeah, I'm gonna just fucking get in there. We're taking ears and making dollars.
Dungeon Master 02:32:57 Yeah, you can move at them. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:33:10 They get in this guy's business. This is one I cast troops drag on, and I'm just going to get at him a little bit. It will.
Dungeon Master 02:33:35 Trace, I'm going to put your moonbeam right there, and the other guy took half damage, but he also took damage. 25 hits.
Cyrus Schwert 02:33:41 The 25 to hit. I think it was so slow. Another cheesecake. Plus one, 13 to hit on the first one. I just chop at it.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:57 Nice. Nice.
Dungeon Master 02:34:11 13 damage. That is. Okay. And second hit. 23 hits. What dice did you switch to? Dice of Enlighten? Hey, good roll.
Cyrus Schwert 02:34:19 It's like 23. Go. What isn't it? And the D6 of forced damage on the last one.
Zariel Torgan 02:34:40 couple good roles that's awesome damn almost 30 damage and
Cletus Cobbington 02:34:44 Okay, go crazy.
Cyrus Schwert 02:34:51 Let's go. So 17 more. That'll do it for me. That'll do it for me.
Dungeon Master 02:34:53 Nice. Looking very hurt. These guys, you can tell, are not incredibly strong. And then last but not least, Leopold, what would you like to do on your surprise round as things get kicked off?
Kaladen Shash 02:34:53 Nice. Nice.
Leopold Magnus 02:35:15 Yeah. So did any of these creatures maybe catch the eye of the duty maker or maybe go over to investigate what that is, or they're just over? All right. Well, I was really hoping to pull one off the cliff here, but that's not going to happen. So I'm going to pop up.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:27 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 02:35:29 Never quite got to that.
Cyrus Schwert 02:35:32 Yeah, we're still surprising them.
Cletus Cobbington 02:35:33 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 02:35:34 Ha ha ha.
Leopold Magnus 02:35:44 off the cliff and go, you didn't see me over there, did you? And with that quip, I'll in just a giant stone boulder right here. Bend 90 degrees at the hip. And I don't want to select this. And target this one with a wand by cat.
Leopold Magnus 02:36:14 and I'll do it at the second level. Oh, okay. That would be my, yeah, that would be my action.
Dungeon Master 02:36:15 And then, Rex, you can do like a shoving attack if you want to try to throw one off the cliff too.
Cletus Cobbington 02:36:30 I'm
Dungeon Master 02:36:35 Opposed athletics check. It's your attack. So if you have two attack actions, you can shoving attack twice or give it two attempts if you fail the first time. It's not your whole action to do it. Yeah, that could have been your prep round that you didn't do anything on.
Leopold Magnus 02:36:45 Okay. Well, I guess then in that case, could you say I shimmied over here and popped up next to this guy? And perfect. And then I guess with my searing saber, I'll try and slice in here and I'll grab him by his shirt, his lapel, and I'll just suplex him over the top of my head behind me and just let him go off the cliff.
Kaladen Shash 02:36:50 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:37:13 Okay. Give me an opposed, opposed athletic checks against him to see if he can fight you off. He gets a plus one to next. Oh, it was almost a net 20.
Cyrus Schwert 02:37:14 Drop and sit on. Oh, great.
Leopold Magnus 02:37:20 Athletics check. Okay. Well, I'm not much better, plus two. Oh, but unless he rolls really well.
Dungeon Master 02:37:34 But it was a two instant. Shout out. Easily, you take them and you suplex back and you do it just so that like your body and back hits the very edge of the cliff and you just throw him over the top and he just goes flying. He gets one dexterity saving throw with disadvantage to try to catch the cliff edge. But if he misses it, he's falling to his death. And that is this guy right here.
Kaladen Shash 02:37:39 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:38:13 That is a natural 20 and a natural three. You send this cobald flying off the edge. And with that, we're going to start into our normal initiative, Zoro, Europe first. Yeah, do you have more movement? Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:38:16 Oh. Well, I guess so you said I would have two attacks, because I have two attacks. Well, if I had prep myself by moving there, then I didn't use much. Yeah, so with that toss, I'll go, enjoy the fuck.
Zariel Torgan 02:38:20 Oof.
Kaladen Shash 02:38:39 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:38:46 pocket his ear and run over here and with my steering saber, make one attack on this guy. I think that'll probably hit 28. It'll take 13 damage and an additional
Dungeon Master 02:39:06 208 hits. In total. Good hits. All right. Now back up to the top. Zario, you've got to go.
Leopold Magnus 02:39:17 three fire damage for 16 with the swing of my saber. And that's my turn.
Dungeon Master 02:39:36 Things got kicked up a little early. Yeah. There's a moonbeam in the center. Anything?
Zariel Torgan 02:39:45 If I pass through, so it's, it's a moonbeam like a trail, like, how do I show this on my side? Is it going like this? Oh, vertical.
Cletus Cobbington 02:40:01 It's like a straight, like, cylinder going straight down. Yeah, it's not traveling. I can, I make it move, but not, like, on my turn, not at the same time.
Kaladen Shash 02:40:04 vertical column yeah
Dungeon Master 02:40:05 Can you see it on the map? It's right here. Yeah, it's like a beam of light comes down from the sky. You couldn't go around the back. That's flip face right there. You couldn't go around the back. That's flip face right there. You'd have to go through it or around it.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:16 Gotcha. All right, I'd like to get right over here if I can, which I think I could shimmy by. And then I'd like to... Here? Okay, all right, so I was here, I think. So I was here, I think.
Dungeon Master 02:40:36 on the top. You were about there, yeah. To where?
Zariel Torgan 02:40:44 or was i here i was uh shit okay so can i push past this this one here i'm just i want to get over here on this side of them if i can't then i can't i'll do something else but
Dungeon Master 02:41:07 Well, if you were to move to like here, the cliff starts like right at the center of that point. So you would have to go through the moon beam, but you could get in and out of his thing. Or you go over the top, but you couldn't fit other ones.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:23 And I like, yeah, can I like make a, make some sort of check to try to scramble around or squeeze past like athletic or acrobatics or something to try not to land having to go through the moonbeam?
Dungeon Master 02:41:39 If you go through the bottom, you will go through the moonbeam. If you go through the top, you won't.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:46 I don't think I have enough speed to make it that way. If I do it the other way, so 5, 10, 15. Yeah, I can only get to here if I go around. How much damage is the moonbeam? Oh, shit. I don't want to take that. All right.
Cletus Cobbington 02:42:01 2d10. I just wrote really bad. I mean, did you roll a check. You have to roll a check.
Kaladen Shash 02:42:05 Yeah, it's the first thing we're seeing today.
Dungeon Master 02:42:09 You get 98 here, you're fine. Tracy is going to roll a one in a two. Conn's going to roll a one and a two.
Cyrus Schwert 02:42:09 You do.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:16 Alright, fine. I'll go right here and I'll take the... You're going to roll two tens. I can tell. It's going to be... It's going to be 20 total damage. Oh, come on. I got con save? Oh. That's a natural 20. That's a natural 20.
Leopold Magnus 02:42:22 Oh. Nice. Nice.
Cletus Cobbington 02:42:31 Yeah, content. Wait, wait. Yeah, content. Nice. All right. So half damage. Five damage.
Kaladen Shash 02:42:36 Yeah, you could get half damage. Yeah, here we go. And you got, you got a blessed, you got, you got a bless rolling on that.
Cyrus Schwert 02:42:39 I'll imagine it's saved. Oh, I forgot about the bless. I forgot about the bless.
Dungeon Master 02:42:44 Natural 20. Oh, yeah. Take five points of damage. And then you can get right there.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:56 All right. All right. All right. Okay. I'm going to cast Thunderwave. Let's see where I'm at here. It's going to be a con save of 16. And my rolls are just fantastic.
Dungeon Master 02:43:17 Nice. Peace gun. First one gets a Nat 20. Second one gets a five. Just go in order. The Sorcer number one rolled the 20. Sorcercer number two rolls the Fass.
Zariel Torgan 02:43:27 well you can pick whichever one you'd prefer gets what okay so the first one okay so the second one gets ten feet yeah
Cletus Cobbington 02:43:32 Nice.
Cyrus Schwert 02:43:42 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:43:46 Oh, yeah, that's a better one to have failed, because the first one would still be on. This guy, same deal who get a deck save with disadvantage to see if he can hang on. Oh, that was just normal. One more time, that didn't let me do disadvantage. 17 is the lower of the two. He...
Zariel Torgan 02:44:00 All right.
Dungeon Master 02:44:12 gets knocked and you see he's holding on with one hand as he is sort of barely on the edge. I'm going to say it's going to take his entire action to get up on his next round. He won't be able to do anything else other than correct himself of anything. And then the first one, do they both still take damage on it? Okay. Oh, you already rolled it in June.
Cyrus Schwert 02:44:13 Great.
Zariel Torgan 02:44:33 Uh, yeah, but the one that succeeds takes half damage. Yeah, yeah, it was not. That wasn't terrible. It was decent. It's a little less than average.
Cletus Cobbington 02:44:33 Yes.
Kaladen Shash 02:44:37 It was seven. That would tell.
Dungeon Master 02:44:41 Okay, so number. It's more to move them. He's already taking damage, so he's looking pretty hurt. And that one failed and takes a whole second. Okay. Anything else?
Zariel Torgan 02:45:04 That's me. No, that's movement action, and I don't have any real bonuses, so we're good.
Dungeon Master 02:45:13 Okay, after you then it is Cletus. It's Cletus. It's at the start of their turn, right?
Cletus Cobbington 02:45:20 Does this count? Okay, let's see. Do they get hit with another round of Moonbeam if I choose to keep concentrating with it? Are for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there? So we haven't gotten to their turn, right?
Dungeon Master 02:45:48 Yeah, they just haven't started their turn yet. Yeah. You can cast non-concentration spells. Normally, like...
Cletus Cobbington 02:45:54 Well, I want to keep that activated, I think. Let's see. So I can't cast any other spells since I'm concentrating. So I guess I'll just hold the moon reading. Only other concentration spells count. Right. Right, right, right.
Dungeon Master 02:46:13 non-concentration. So like cantrip, pen did not be concentration. Anything that doesn't have the little C on it next to its name, you can cast. Okay. Do you want to move it all?
Kaladen Shash 02:46:15 That's right.
Cyrus Schwert 02:46:16 Come on in, the water's fine.
Cletus Cobbington 02:46:25 All right. Yeah, I don't think there's really anything that would benefit at the moment. Sure. Yeah. I'll probably move. We'll move up here. And I can't make like a physical attack, can I?
Leopold Magnus 02:46:45 Thanks.
Cyrus Schwert 02:46:51 Fuck this guy up.
Cletus Cobbington 02:46:54 Does that break concentration? OK. OK. Or Joe. Right. Right. I'm just going to hold moving. OK. OK. OK.
Dungeon Master 02:46:55 No, not when you cast a spell. No, it doesn't break concentration, but it would be like, yeah, you'd have to choose to do something else. No, wait, so you didn't cast another spell, did you? You can make a basic melee attack? That's fine. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:47:02 to action. Thank you. Okay. Really? Swing at that. Some of the staff.
Cletus Cobbington 02:47:23 Since I'm close, I'm going to poke it with the spear. 3020. All right, so is that the D6 or D8? I don't know how that works. Oops. I don't. I don't. The D8?
Dungeon Master 02:47:31 Oh, I forgot you had that. Nice. 3020 hits. Are you wielding it with two hands or one hand? Do you have a shield equipped or not? Okay, so you get the D8. And are you attuned to it?
Cyrus Schwert 02:47:36 Let's go new spirit.
Kaladen Shash 02:47:42 Two-handed. Yeah. It was full action D8.
Cletus Cobbington 02:47:51 Okay. Plus 1D6 poison. Is it a attunement slot? I would have said that as soon as I added it as soon as we started when it was given to me and we did all that traveling, so I'd assume that I would say I'd be attuning.
Dungeon Master 02:48:01 It does, because you only did plus one. Yeah, you would have attuned to it.
Kaladen Shash 02:48:15 Right, you click, just, yeah, just select the attune button and it'll add the stats to your roles. Just bless.
Cletus Cobbington 02:48:22 Okay. So I don't think that would have changed. It would have been a plus three, so plus two more. Yes. All right.
Dungeon Master 02:48:32 Does the plus change? Is it still a D8? Yeah. So you got a nine plus one. You wrote, you did 10 damage. Oh, that's two that attack rolls. It's not the damage. But that, uh, cobalt only had four HP left. Uh, you, how do you want to finish him as he's in combat with Cyrus? You just walk up and stab him.
Kaladen Shash 02:48:43 If you ever remember anything, he's on the attacks. Okay. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:48:48 Fuck this guy up. Yes.
Cletus Cobbington 02:49:02 Let's go. I run up, looking down, I got my new spear. It has a cute little mushroom on the tip, and I just fucking poke into this guy's chest. I'm like,
Dungeon Master 02:49:14 Just poke it real quick. It just spurs blood. You hit a major vessel. It's just, like, gouting out. As he, like, goes to hold... And just kind of fall flat. Um... He's... He's dead. This guy...
Cyrus Schwert 02:49:20 I fucking stole my kill, bro. Trying to pump my numbers up. It's possible.
Leopold Magnus 02:49:29 Damn, you toadstooled that guy.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:32 Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Cletus Cobbington 02:49:34 My bad. Maybe I'm pretty, pretty nasty with a spear. Yes, yes, yes. Eight damage.
Dungeon Master 02:49:44 Right here, he rolled his, I rolled it up there. His con safe, he got an 18 on it. So he takes half damage. Go ahead and roll 2D10 trace. And then he will take his action.
Cletus Cobbington 02:50:11 Or did he make the save?
Dungeon Master 02:50:13 And he take eight. He did, so he takes out. Look and hurt. You see, he doesn't, as far as they go, this one is incentive to game.
Kaladen Shash 02:50:15 He made.
Dungeon Master 02:50:33 He doesn't look very muscular. He looks like Gons. He's wearing tattered clothing. But he, in his hands, both at the same time, charges up this arcane energy. And he's going to shoot a chromatic bolt at both Cletus and Cyrus. And that'll be... I'll just say same order. Cletus, that is a 8 to hit you. That is...
Cletus Cobbington 02:50:53 Yep. Yep.
Dungeon Master 02:51:05 You know, that's a nine. I think that misses both of you. Cool. And that's all he could do because he missed both. Cyrus, if you turn, this lizard just dragon ball Zed grass.
Zariel Torgan 02:51:07 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 02:51:09 It does. This lizard's freaking Dragon Balls being harassed. I freaking dodged it, dude. That was crazy. No.
Kaladen Shash 02:51:19 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:51:31 You watch anime, you fucking nerd. No, I'm kidding. I draw the anime.
Dungeon Master 02:51:35 Cyrus? Cyrus? Your turn, sir? You're so on.
Zariel Torgan 02:51:38 The racism we can handle. The anime. Acceptable. All right.
Cyrus Schwert 02:51:40 Never seen it. It's going to get to fucking. It's trying to go hand in there. He's. He's. He turns it? Oh, sorry. Thank you. Is this guy gotten up yet? Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:51:42 Ha ha ha ha.
Dungeon Master 02:52:07 The guy on the cliff? He isn't gone yet. So no. Yeah. I'll say if you make contact, if you rolled a hit and you land it, he automatically falls because he's,
Kaladen Shash 02:52:12 I've been his turn. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 02:52:13 Can I run over there? Two, three. Yeah, can I try to cut his ears off with one attack and then push him with another?
Cletus Cobbington 02:52:13 He's just dangling.
Zariel Torgan 02:52:14 How does Ziaz off for he falls?
Dungeon Master 02:52:32 Like it was a Nat 20 to hit him. He failed his deck save. There's no way he can make it up. So he is essentially prone. So go ahead and roll with advantage. And you have blessed for if you need it.
Cyrus Schwert 02:52:44 Okay. Okay. Oh, hell yeah. I think I hit him probably. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:52:48 I'm
Dungeon Master 02:53:04 28 absolutely hit. You just, you reach down and you grab his like little scrawny claw and you, as you like pick him up, cut off in like almost like you're pairing an apple or something. You have your thumb there to catch it. You cut off his ear and you just let him go off the clip. He falls to his death. Anything else on your turn? Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:53:06 That's what you.
Cyrus Schwert 02:53:20 I'm an adventure. They're a bad guys. They're bad guys. It's fine. So I can, like, take five more feet of movement if I have it and try to get this guy with my second one.
Leopold Magnus 02:53:25 Nice. Oh, getting a little blood thirsty there. Be careful.
Zariel Torgan 02:53:29 Ha-ha-ha.
Dungeon Master 02:53:46 Mm-hmm. And you have advantage on this because you could, you are, oh, that hits anyway, so you don't need it, unless you grit. You could, like, really get close to the edge of the moonbeam without touching it, and you could get flanking. You just go a little closer. Same thing.
Cyrus Schwert 02:54:02 Let's get. Did not create. Got it. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:54:22 I think you will kill him. You guys do a minimum more than that. Why didn't that one add your modifier? Why didn't that one add your modifier, but the other one did? Okay, we'll do that. Yeah, finish this guy.
Cyrus Schwert 02:54:32 Like what? So that was that one. I don't know. I probably just didn't read the first click that I did. It was 17. I just slice him down like he's nothing, even though he tried to Dragon Ball's Mimi. Fuck you. Fuck you, bitch. And I just, I feel like it's nothing, then get ready for the next thing. And that's my turn.
Cletus Cobbington 02:54:51 Get into your.
Dungeon Master 02:55:04 Cut him down quick, falls down, up to that would be him, but he's dead. Then it is Leopold. You know what to do? What you know what to do?
Zariel Torgan 02:55:12 Yes.
Leopold Magnus 02:55:12 Oh yeah. Seems like there's been some damage done, but I'm just going to focus on the one here in front. Laser sword in hand, slice and dice. Let's see. 19 on the first swing. Is that going to hit?
Dungeon Master 02:55:36 19 hits. Yeah, for sure. 10. 11, Damon. Looking pretty hurt. You could kill him, probably. On a high roll, you could kill him.
Leopold Magnus 02:55:40 Nice. Oh, solid. 11 damage. And then the second swing. How's he looking? Is he looking pretty hurt? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you know what?
Leopold Magnus 02:56:06 I guess that necrotic stuff with the overcharge doesn't necessarily stack, does it? While I killed the elder brain and absorbed its soul. Draw the life force of a slayed enemy. When you kill an enemy, you can use your reaction, absorb the life force, and add 1D6 necrotic damage. I was just imagining that's to like my next attack.
Cyrus Schwert 02:56:10 Uh huh?
Dungeon Master 02:56:16 What do you mean? I have to read the thing. I don't remember what I wrote. No, that's when you want to use it. You essentially have a built-up charge in the central gem.
Leopold Magnus 02:56:42 Okay. And can charge more than one or just the one? Yeah. All right. I'll just hit him with a 1D6 necrotic damage, top them off. And then 22, I think we'll hit.
Dungeon Master 02:56:50 One at a time. So, but like if you killed this guy by expending a charge, you could refill your charge. So he'll take 22 hits. So he'll take three on top of whatever you roll for this.
Kaladen Shash 02:56:57 recharge we got him got him
Leopold Magnus 02:57:16 Damn, some low rolls, which is unfortunate. Oh, but five fire damage. Oh, look that. Damn it. For a bonus action, I'll blow stiffly on him and hope he dies. Bonus action, I'll pull out.
Dungeon Master 02:57:25 Oh, he is so hurt. He's not just knocking at Jeff's door, but he's being let in actively. H.B. He's at one HB.
Kaladen Shash 02:57:29 Ah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:57:44 Thanks.
Leopold Magnus 02:57:46 Bone Crusher, who I've now souped up, refabbed from his premature demise in the fight against the Astral Chimera, and I'll say, Bone Crusher, get him! I'll direct him to attack that guy.
Zariel Torgan 02:58:03 I think it's I think it gets insta-kill, right?
Dungeon Master 02:58:09 And remind me, does they get to do something on the first turn or does it have to wait around while I go find the token?
Leopold Magnus 02:58:14 I mean, I think he just goes after I do. Where's the... Where is the... Let me see. Let me see. I'll read about it.
Kaladen Shash 02:58:28 But
Dungeon Master 02:58:30 Not exactly. I mean like when you summon him, does he immediately take an action or does it have to? I just don't know how it works. Hold on. Can you read it for me? I also have to find the token. It's on a different map.
Leopold Magnus 02:58:48 In combat, the defender shares your initiative count, but takes its turn immediately after yours. Can move, use the reaction on. Cool. Yeah, so I'll command him to strike down my foe.
Dungeon Master 02:59:02 Yeah, yeah. Let's see a lot. 14 misses. That sucks. That sucks. That didn't. That didn't work.
Kaladen Shash 02:59:05 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:59:17 gonna hit 14 to hit damn yeah and that's my turn
Dungeon Master 02:59:32 Okay. After that will be that guy's turn, actually. He, pretty pissed at your attack again, will do. He's not within five feet of his buddy. So he just makes two spear attacks.
Leopold Magnus 02:59:53 And bone crusher will use the deflect attack and impose disadvantage on the attack roll of one creature. It can see, which is this guy? It just says to impose disadvantage on the attack roll of one creature, it can see, provided the attack roll is against a creature other than the defender. So it was on me, right?
Dungeon Master 03:00:03 13 is it for the rest of the rounder just in a one attack yeah he makes two attacks yeah he makes two attacks the first one missed anyway your bone pressure uses on the second one it still misses um
Cletus Cobbington 03:00:08 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 03:00:29 So he didn't anything do anything on his turn. After him. So hold not. I'm going to grab your thing real quick because it'll change the land of the map.
Cletus Cobbington 03:00:39 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 03:00:57 But the other cobalt that's in the top corner is going to run down and try to get flanking. Perfect. It's going to go like that. And he will take his two-spirit attacks with advantage.
Dungeon Master 03:01:30 First one is... Oh, your AC's so high. I don't think you'll ever hit. Dirty 20. Misses. Yeah, I know. 15 also misses. You're impossible to hit. That's kind of your thing. That's the end of his turn up at the top of Zario.
Leopold Magnus 03:01:39 Yeah, that's a mess.
Zariel Torgan 03:01:56 all right i'm going to see um is it kind of a goes without saying that we're going to chop these guys as ears off or are we going to come back and do it later all right um
Kaladen Shash 03:02:13 Now.
Leopold Magnus 03:02:15 Yeah, just get them now. Oh, you know, you bastard.
Zariel Torgan 03:02:21 And I'd use that as my bonus action since I can't really do anything with the bonus action anyway. Just cut off some ears. Okay, so I'll grab those and then I'll move here. I'm gonna steal the kill from Leo and get those ears. I just don't want him to go.
Dungeon Master 03:02:27 You can. Everybody's just been getting it as part of their attack anyway. For real.
Cletus Cobbington 03:02:46 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 03:02:49 Actually, these guys are at the bottom of initiative. You know what? I'll be nice. I'll come over here. I'll get this guy. I'll let you get him. I'm going to hit him with a poison spray. So that's going to be con save 16. This iridescent liquid just kind of shoots out of my mouth.
Dungeon Master 03:03:12 On things. That is a 12. Oh. Huge hit. Yeah. Good hit. Yeah. Good hit. He hadn't been touched yet, but he's looking pretty hurt now.
Zariel Torgan 03:03:18 All right. So he takes 2D12 poison damage. Oh, damn. Damn. That's 22 poison damage. Oh. All right. That's my turn.
Leopold Magnus 03:03:29 I'll hail them.
Kaladen Shash 03:03:31 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 03:03:45 You took them down by half health. After that, it's Cletus. Yeah. Both of them are still alive. One is at half health. The other one is at one HB.
Cletus Cobbington 03:03:57 All right. Is that guy still alive? On the right? Okay. On the right. On the left. On the left. On the left.
Zariel Torgan 03:04:10 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 03:04:28 Nice for knowing it. I love it. 18 hits.
Cletus Cobbington 03:04:29 And I'll cancel. I'll unconstitutional movie, and we don't need that thing. Nice. Oh, I didn't roll my hit yet. My bad. 18 to hit. And I roll the damage before. Roll the 1. Oh, plus a D6. OK. Plus 3, 7 damage.
Dungeon Master 03:05:00 Seven damage to that guy. Looking even more hurt but not down. All right, anything else? Okay. Zarius. You are muted, sir. I'm sure you said something really funny.
Cletus Cobbington 03:05:09 and then i'll just run up like right here that's it you're muted
Cyrus Schwert 03:05:29 It wasn't that funny. This is crazy. I'm gonna go fuck this guy up. Can I get like... Yeah, fuck the... I'm gonna swing at the one. For sure. Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 03:05:31 Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Dungeon Master 03:05:39 Copper bottom. You're taking the 1H beer. Completely surrounded, you definitely get advantage on this.
Cletus Cobbington 03:05:52 that i purposely saved
Cyrus Schwert 03:06:01 You know it. I got to get it. I got to get what's what. I say, sorry, Leopold, but I, I'm trying my best here.
Dungeon Master 03:06:09 26 hits. It's dead. You can't do it. There's no way you don't do at least one point of damage. Yeah. Finish with fuck. Imagine you walking up apologizing and then just slowly embedding your sword into it.
Leopold Magnus 03:06:27 Well, you're an adventurer now, so... Spilling blood is part of it.
Cyrus Schwert 03:06:32 Indeed. Not fast. That'll be my turn. Yeah, I can't even get into its space. That's fine.
Kaladen Shash 03:06:40 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 03:06:42 Okay, second attack. Okay, just leaving the other one. No, not really. Leopold, you have this Cobold right in front of you that gets stabbed through the heart and just passes out dead. You just can spin around. There's one behind you, sort of pushing on the back of your legs.
Dungeon Master 03:07:13 Again, they're only about three to four feet tall. So with, um, easy. Looking pretty here. Potentially.
Leopold Magnus 03:07:18 Okay. What's the status of this guy? He's taking some blows. Is he looking pretty hurt? Like maybe one swing would do it? Is there a way I can swing and kind of hold the blow that just doesn't immediately finish him? Can I intentionally do that?
Dungeon Master 03:07:44 You can do violence, yeah. You can roll out your attack. 15 hits.
Leopold Magnus 03:07:46 Yeah, I'll do that with two strikes of my saber. Yeah. 15 to hit. Okay. Nine damage plus.
Leopold Magnus 03:08:15 three damage is that enough to take him down or would need a little bit more damage okay 23 looks like it hit and okay so with that slice I just kind of pulled my blade a little bit and I say bone crusher finish him bone crusher
Dungeon Master 03:08:17 No, but real close. It's a little bit more. 23 hit. Okay, now you can't. There's no way you don't take it down. Oh, interesting. Good use use of that.
Leopold Magnus 03:08:44 will roll the hit um right where do i come on out yep he swings and he hits seven damage uh
Dungeon Master 03:09:05 Seven damage. How does bone pressure finish this?
Leopold Magnus 03:09:11 Yeah, you kind of observe bone crusher slowly get put back together earlier. It seems like maybe some improvements have been made and he's less stiff and less robotic. He's a bit more organic on his feet. So he kind of.
Leopold Magnus 03:09:28 slides up and with a really smooth action he just slices through the cobald cobald severed into its legs remain standing the chest slides off the back of the cliff bone crusher then just kicks the remaining bit of torso off the edge and wipes its blade clean sheathing it
Cyrus Schwert 03:09:53 Did he get to ears?
Dungeon Master 03:09:53 You guys... Oh, does he get the ears? Interesting point. When bone crusher gets this kill, you guys see, it almost looks like
Cletus Cobbington 03:09:58 That robot's swaggy as fuck.
Leopold Magnus 03:09:58 What's that? And. And. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:10:12 dark black and purple magic sort of seeps out of the cobalt and like almost siphon it funnels into one spot in the center of bone crusher seemingly gets absorbed by the form.
Leopold Magnus 03:10:28 And Leopold, completely unobservant of the life force that's pressure, is giddy with the fact that improvements to the pistons and steam cylinders that operate bone crusher worked. Oh boy, looks like my tinkering really did pay off. Good job, bone crusher.
Dungeon Master 03:10:53 It can't speak or anything, so it doesn't do anything. But with that, you guys finish off the cobalds. And with that, we can end the session, too, as it sort of, we'll finish it off at the end of this fight. You kick the half of the cobald off the cliff after getting the ear.
Cyrus Schwert 03:10:56 Thanks.
Leopold Magnus 03:10:58 Yeah, it's just at like a century's rest.
Dungeon Master 03:11:24 The wind howls. You hear the dull thud of the bodies as they hit sort of the cliff face way far down. Just the wind blowing, sort of the stalling as it stops, picks up again. You hear rustling of trees way, way down. You have the path to continue forward for next time. You don't think there's any more threat. You don't hear anything, see anything.
Dungeon Master 03:11:52 No loud noises, no vibrations, nothing crazy. It's just this lull. Unless you guys want to do anything, you can just call it there.
Cyrus Schwert 03:12:01 Leopold, do you think that the shit in your gears is dried enough to pick it out now? Because it's getting to be a lot. It's been like a couple days.
Leopold Magnus 03:12:08 Oh, well, I guess I defer to Zario. He was the one. Dry.
Kaladen Shash 03:12:09 Uh-huh.
Zariel Torgan 03:12:10 You know, I just want to say that the idea that we are trying to sneak up on somebody, and every time they're like, what the fuck is that smell? And who it's just us, like, sneaking. It's hilarious. Oh, man.
Cletus Cobbington 03:12:30 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 03:12:33 Yeah, I'm kind of holding my foot and I'm like, oh, oh, Cyrus, a little hand here. Could you, maybe, could you get that bit? Oh, well, maybe, could you get that bit?
Cyrus Schwert 03:12:45 I don't have little hands. I don't have, I don't have little hands. I can't get in between those grooves. Yeah, Chip.
Zariel Torgan 03:12:49 Big meaty hands. He's just...
Cletus Cobbington 03:13:03 What do you say, Chip? Chip. Chip's not talking. Double thumbs up.
Leopold Magnus 03:13:14 What did Chip say? Double thumbs up. Get in there, Chip.
Cyrus Schwert 03:13:16 Thank you. Thank you.
Dungeon Master 03:13:18 Chip's opening a Pokemon pack. Chip discos. And you catch him. Having not been listening. But you're making Chip, you pick this shit out.
Zariel Torgan 03:13:27 That's funny. Oh, that's funny.
Cletus Cobbington 03:13:30 It's right. He gives a double thumbs up to the shit picking. He takes a little twig and fucking woodpicks it out.
Leopold Magnus 03:13:40 Oh, you think I have dexterous hands? I'm a giant suit of armor. I can't get in there. It's a... Oh, yeah. Well, thank you there, Chip. I'll make sure and get on that gun of yours.
Dungeon Master 03:13:44 Once he figures out what you guys said, he's just, he almost refuses. He steps back and goes,
Kaladen Shash 03:13:48 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 03:13:55 Oh, God.
Cletus Cobbington 03:14:07 gives you a crisp thumbs up scurries on back all right
Dungeon Master 03:14:17 Okay. You have D-Shat. Killed your enemies. If you got an ear from every single one of them, you have six cobald ears. Well, now that you ask that, now that you ask that question, he said he would offer you 10...
Leopold Magnus 03:14:17 Hell yeah. Tisha. How much did old turtle say he'd pay?
Zariel Torgan 03:14:22 I think.
Cyrus Schwert 03:14:26 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 03:14:33 15 year, what do you say? No, not Cobold. I love that. That's what I thought. We're just going to give them, we'll give them all the years, all these.
Dungeon Master 03:14:45 like goals worth of gem for every null ear that you brought up. Do you guys know the difference though?
Leopold Magnus 03:14:51 No, these aren't Knowles. Oh, what are we going to do with all these ears? So we did cut
Zariel Torgan 03:14:54 That's funny. We're gonna get... We're gonna get back and he's gonna be like, that's just, that religious convent in the mountain, that's a totally different group. Those are my cousins. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 03:14:54 God, we're serial killers. No. Massacred whole tribe.
Cyrus Schwert 03:14:57 We're just helping fucking dragons. Us as characters? They do a lot for charity, actually, for unhoused youths.
Kaladen Shash 03:15:04 Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:15:15 He did mention these creatures. He said there were lizard-like creatures that had already been established in the mountains that they had sort of sited with, but you didn't see any knolls.
Zariel Torgan 03:15:27 Okay. Well, he might not know he's old as shit. Yep. A polymorph one of you guys into a knoll with like 80 ears and we'll just chop them all off.
Cletus Cobbington 03:15:31 That's right.
Kaladen Shash 03:15:33 We're getting closer, getting closer. 100%. That's correct. Lots of nulls. That's great.
Leopold Magnus 03:15:36 I said for each ear, if we cut two off of each creature, then we get paid double, right? Oh, God. That's good. Yeah. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 03:15:46 God made them with two years for a reason.
Dungeon Master 03:16:01 What a fleece and old man?
Leopold Magnus 03:16:06 An old portal. That's great. Jonathan, I took a shot at Leopold. Turned out pretty cool. I might still work on it. Anything? Is this a fucking cow head with a milk?
Zariel Torgan 03:16:06 D&D. Yeah, sweet. I think it looks good. I think that Cletus needs to change his to this first cow one. I think it looks... I think the month the milk is really good.
Kaladen Shash 03:16:18 I was going to say, yeah, it looked really good.
Dungeon Master 03:16:28 The one with the milk or the one with chip? The fact that it says almonds on the bag. Ridiculous.
Leopold Magnus 03:16:35 glass. Is that a bag of almonds? Nice. That's great. That's great.
Cletus Cobbington 03:16:38 sack almond that's great it's so good it's so good
Cyrus Schwert 03:16:42 It's a sack. It's a pretty big sack of almonds, really.
Kaladen Shash 03:16:46 I actually love that one. That's why I was like, this has got to be it. Nice.
Zariel Torgan 03:16:51 Yeah, I was really happy with that. I had a really, really specific prompt. It was, it was thick. Yeah. Yeah, the second one's not as good. It's, uh, he's definitely, he's definitely skipping Lake Day.
Dungeon Master 03:17:02 The distorted ground around his thin legs, like it goes from being wheat field to like grass. They made them jack to that one, but at least you have chip. I always imagine chip being a little more like raggly.
Cletus Cobbington 03:17:11 Hell yeah. For sure. That's great.
Leopold Magnus 03:17:18 Yeah. It doesn't say... The bag says, like, almost almonds, but it's not quite right. Olles. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 03:17:24 Yeah, you didn't... Yeah, it's... It's like almondoles. I, uh, I put in the, for the second one, for, uh, it is the almond shooter. And I think it does say almond, it says, all mored shooter.
Dungeon Master 03:17:39 I like that Leopold, though. It doesn't say all merge shooters.
Leopold Magnus 03:17:46 Yeah, I got a couple of them. I'm sure which one's the best. Oh, all moored. There's also this one. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 03:17:57 Yeah, it's just close. That is a good Leo. Oh, damn. Those are both sweet. He's giant, yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:18:06 I'm going to say, it's always important, like, we always forget because he's so polite, but Leopold's in, like, this death suit of armor that protects him constantly, so the fact that it looks so badass, and then he's, like, always saying, oh, dear. Not his call of Cletus.
Leopold Magnus 03:18:16 Oh, yeah. He's fucking huge, too. I think he's like almost seven feet tall. Yeah, Claytuce beats beats me, which is funny. But I guess he's a big cow.
Zariel Torgan 03:18:29 Big boy. I think with his scoliosis, though, cleanness is like five feet. Just hunched over. Oh, shit.
Kaladen Shash 03:18:36 who's big
Cletus Cobbington 03:18:36 He just is a big boy. No, he's 7.6 with a hunchback. Or 8 foot with the hunchback. Make him 70s. Yeah. No, he's still huge. He's got a little neck hunchback. But
Dungeon Master 03:18:51 With, oh, so he's eight foot, then he's down, still caller.
Leopold Magnus 03:18:58 With a hunchback, he's seven, six. Damn. Yeah, likewise. That was, uh, we will do it again next week, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 03:19:06 Crazy. All right, sweet. Well, thank you, Jonathan. Yeah, that was good. Yeah, I'm good for it.
Kaladen Shash 03:19:10 Good session, guys. Yeah, that's fun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know what the temps are going to be like this weekend.
Cletus Cobbington 03:19:13 Oh, yeah. I just pictured.

Cletus Cobbington 00:00:00 I will say it was very shocking.
Cyrus Schwert 00:00:00 That's a better one.
Dungeon Master 00:00:07 Oh, righty. We will... Trace, did you read the summary? Cool. I won't get crazy into detail then. I thought it was a great read. Loved it. I think it's perfect. Whatever you go down to, we don't have to change it, but I love the part where it describes Cyrus falling and catching himself. I absolutely loved
Leopold Magnus 00:00:24 That's awesome. It's from a new model. Yeah, I really did a good job.
Cletus Cobbington 00:00:28 It's shocking not having at least
Dungeon Master 00:00:37 That's a great moment. Yeah, but just to recap it, after you guys all finished your trial demonstration, the great omniscient eye, this spider monster who revealed to you that she just wanted to challenge you because you were worthy and she was going to feast on you in her confidence that she would win to gain more power to grow, to satiate her stomach.
Cyrus Schwert 00:00:51 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:01:06 Combat began almost immediately, with Zariel transforming Kaladin into a neon-striped giant ape with an afro, and as the summary described it, B-movie vibes. Which I thought was really good. Cletus skirted to the border of the map and cast Moonbeam, doing what he knows to be tried and true over it.
Kaladen Shash 00:01:19 Yes, I love that.
Zariel Torgan 00:01:21 Yeah, that was a great ad.
Cyrus Schwert 00:01:27 That's right.
Dungeon Master 00:01:36 um leopold summoned bone pressure who unfortunately died pretty quickly um and cyrus slapped uh the baboon on the ass that big uh big red juicy butt and it was a great moment the fight with the eye um you really missed a good one trace i loved it
Cletus Cobbington 00:01:36 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:02:00 especially because it was entirely four. They had no say. Fighting this monster was pretty hard. It was pretty dynamic up and down the web. You could attack from above and below, jumping into attacks. Great smites. The first round ended with her being cut through the net by Cyrus, and as she fell, almost kind of curled up like a spider, she eventually caught herself about 35 feet down.
Zariel Torgan 00:02:00 It was good.
Dungeon Master 00:02:29 It started feasting on her young to grow bigger and heal that she entered her mythic state and the fight continued. But this time she had the use of her anti magic cone and various, um, I beams that she could shoot out, uh, at random, um, close fight. Nobody quite died, which is really great. But, um, at the end, she, uh, sort of started imploding, uh,
Dungeon Master 00:02:58 all up into that very central eye which fell and Cyrus reached out and grabbed it
Dungeon Master 00:03:04 You did a little bit of rest before realizing that the whole nest was going to come down upon you, so you all sort of jumped down towards the bottom, utilizing various combos and spells to sort of slow your fall as you hit the bottom. We ended with you guys, and I had said before that it was not totally spiderweb infested, but then I was thinking about the logic, and with this sort of area and down being flooded, if there was no web, you'd be underwater.
Dungeon Master 00:03:32 So we leave it as you guys are still sort of in the web area, but it's like this dark maintenance tunnel that was immediately sort of recognized in design and layout. Not layout exactly, but the way it's built from Zariel and Leopold, who had spent a lot of time under Nunu Arbor's tunnel system.
Zariel Torgan 00:03:51 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:03:55 So it sort of looked like just a very fey version of a maintenance tunnel for a city. And the spiderweb is pretty sparse at first, but as everything sort of goes in a straight line down, it gets dark. Even though it's a dark vision, it kind of extends beyond your vision. But you do hear kind of muffled, but very present. It's like a loud roaring of what sounds like water rushing through a very tight system.
Dungeon Master 00:04:26 What would you, the Odears, like to do? You're muted. I don't know. What are you doing? Mm-hmm.
Zariel Torgan 00:04:36 I mean we're headed up into the city, right? Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:04:43 That works.
Leopold Magnus 00:04:44 Yeah, I guess I lost track of our objective. So we have like a couple of options, right? Yep. Because it's flowing upstream away from us. Correct to get back to help ratchet but we don't want to use the teleporter outright. What's that?
Kaladen Shash 00:04:49 I think one was to try to solve the source of the pull of the water, which we might be at. Right? Right. And the other one was to activate the teleportation area. Yep. And that's somewhere in the city. Yeah, we are unsure if that's a safe option for us or if we're better suited to sneak back in. But there's a lot of
Dungeon Master 00:04:59 you you
Leopold Magnus 00:05:15 Yeah. Yeah, yeah. The time for going back the funnel way, that would be several weeks. Yeah. So maybe we can come up with something creative with the teleportation circle. I mean, I guess we're not there yet. We'll figure it out when we get there.
Kaladen Shash 00:05:19 Give and take. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not. No.
Cyrus Schwert 00:05:25 Yeah, it's going to take a month. I'm sorry. It took so long to get here.
Dungeon Master 00:05:39 two wizards in the party you're not that high level to cast it but like you'd have the knowledge to alter spells like you could spend some time on those sigils that's just a very common like wizard spell
Leopold Magnus 00:05:54 Like, I'll tell you what, yeah, I have some wizard, and if it's a teleportation circle, there's something mechanical about it, or is it just a rune? I see. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:06:04 It's a fairly common method.
Dungeon Master 00:06:07 If you do in D&D, the idea of enchanting is that if you place the same enchantment on something repeatedly enough times, the enchantment holds. So a teleportation circle is just like somebody stood in a spot and cast teleportation circle thousands of times, and then eventually the circle was permanent, and so you can step into it and activate it. And you can always teleport to one, specifically if you know it.
Leopold Magnus 00:06:27 OK, maybe we call it and I can team up.
Dungeon Master 00:06:35 So it is like this physical layout of runes that, in theory, somebody with the wizard art study, runic study, could work to alter and do. You do not.
Kaladen Shash 00:06:43 Okay. Yeah. Do we have any history or accounting of teleportation circles other than our dome that we can head back to that could shorten the travel? Nope. You guys came directly to us. Someone skilled sent you
Cyrus Schwert 00:07:01 Me and, did me and Cletus come through? Yeah, so we like, so we know, I mean, unless we may, I don't know if that's like a standing one, I guess. And
Dungeon Master 00:07:06 You did you were pushed through one.
Kaladen Shash 00:07:13 No, no, not right to us. Where did you get dropped off? That was outside the ancient city. Right. Yep.
Leopold Magnus 00:07:15 Ratshit. Ratshit sent them.
Cletus Cobbington 00:07:16 Mm hmm.
Cyrus Schwert 00:07:27 The amber fields. It was from the amber fields to the tombs that you guys were at when we first met with those animal people. OK. Sure. OK.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:29 Yeah. It's the same one we took.
Dungeon Master 00:07:37 You guys were sent through a teleportation spell, like a circle, but it was the teleport spell. And so because it's all fucky at Moonhaven, you were ejected like halfway.
Kaladen Shash 00:07:45 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:07:52 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:07:54 Well, I guess we should follow this water.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:57 Yeah, can I take a listen and just see roughly how far that rushing sound seems to be?
Dungeon Master 00:08:06 like 100 feet or so into the darkness, you can sort of tell maybe like the tunnel is going straight and it hits like a perfectly perpendicular tunnel system where the water seems to be running.
Kaladen Shash 00:08:18 Uh, Jonathan, does this, uh, you said it was a maintenance tunnel. Do we see like valves or like things that we can interact with? No. Okay. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:08:25 No, Nunu Arbor is sort of on the edge of that sort of gear piping steampunk era type look. But Moonhaven, when it was sort of overtaken and down fell, was very like nature based, elven influence, flowing arches and everything is very wooden and elegant. Not quite the sort of mechanical industrial revolution yet.
Dungeon Master 00:09:00 So just a tunnel. Yeah, as you move through it, you're not being followed by the spiders you find with time. It's just you're walking through this very dark space. So anybody who doesn't have darkvision, I don't know if there's somebody in the party, but you wouldn't be able to see unless somebody generated some light. But as you come to the end, all of the spider webbing can...
Cletus Cobbington 00:09:00 Hmm.
Zariel Torgan 00:09:00 Well, yeah, can we just get up close enough to see something?
Kaladen Shash 00:09:02 Let me see this water.
Dungeon Master 00:09:26 like converges in front of you and you sort of hit the end of the nest and the very end of like the webbing is kind of like swaying in the water like it's getting pulled but it's strong enough that it's holding you feel like if you cut the the webbing you could like jump into the water but it it's moving so fast that you couldn't get past it it's like you would get taken into like a water slide kind of rapids thing like pulled directly to the center
Kaladen Shash 00:09:56 How wide was it?
Dungeon Master 00:09:59 You're in like a 10 foot tunnel. Yeah. So the tunnel hits this intersection where the water is being pulled from this other way. Very converged to this point. Everything is very narrow. It's not like a giant lake. It's like, this is the tunnel that everything's being pulled. This is the sort of backflow cause because it's so narrow in comparison. So the water is really high speed because it's same volume, much smaller space.
Cyrus Schwert 00:10:00 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:02 So it's the whole tunnel that's open?
Cletus Cobbington 00:10:16 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:10:27 And so the spiders have pushed the tunnel up to this intersection, but they haven't expanded because as soon as like you go past this point, like you're going to get, I don't know, maybe spiders will get torn to pieces, but you're going to get like yanked into the currents. I think like, yeah, like fireman's hose at water of a tunnel, just blasting water.
Cyrus Schwert 00:10:30 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:42 Suck down the drain for lack of a better term. Um.
Cletus Cobbington 00:10:51 What's that current from Nemo that's going crazy? Why did you know that? It is the East Australian current. Gotcha. I look it up, and it's exactly that. Nice. This guy knows his Nemo.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:53 I was just going to say that, yeah. EA something, EAU. East Australian Current, EAC. Yeah. We're just going to rip it. I just watched Finding Nemo, like, last month. Thanks.
Dungeon Master 00:11:00 Yeah, something like that. Love that. What a name for the band.
Kaladen Shash 00:11:06 Uh,
Cyrus Schwert 00:11:12 Don't you ever fuck with me on Nemo. Nemo is actually one of my favorite movies. Sometimes I feel like Nemo. Like a lost little fish.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:28 Yeah, I'm kind of a cinephile. Yeah, the most Australian.
Cletus Cobbington 00:11:35 I feel like a little octopus girl. All these Nemo experts.
Dungeon Master 00:11:35 Yeah. Yeah. Anyway. Anyway.
Leopold Magnus 00:11:35 What was that? 2, 3, 4, 6, Wallaby Lane. What was the address? Yeah, Wallaby. You guys are aficionados. Ha, ha, ha.
Cyrus Schwert 00:11:42 42, P. Sherman, Wallaby Way, Sydney. That's a pretty good pun. That was a good one. I'm a fish, you know.
Kaladen Shash 00:11:50 Yeah, didn't even catch it.
Dungeon Master 00:12:02 As a reminder, you guys are fairly hurt overall. You just got out of a fight. You have this orb as well as everything else. You have this intersection in front of you. You can take a moment if you'd like, but what would you guys like to do? Does that bring you in?
Zariel Torgan 00:12:23 If we short-rested, I could do another wild shape as a water elemental, and I might be able to control a specific size of water that makes it less violent for us. Okay, so yeah, maybe we could do something in tandem.
Kaladen Shash 00:12:23 So that's cool. I can control a five by five foot cube of water.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:33 Oh yeah, and control the water. Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:12:43 Who?
Cletus Cobbington 00:12:48 I only have challenge rating one, so I cannot.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:50 I was looking at my inventory, and Grace, can you Wild Shape into an Elemental this level? Or because you're Circle of the Shepherd, can you not do that? So, as much as I like this item, I think you should have the Embered Mane.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:14 because it'll let you transform into an elemental by using both of your wild shapes for whatever short rest, and so you'd be able to turn into fire elemental or water elemental or earth elemental. It's a lot more, it's like a CR3. It takes both of them, but... Oh, yeah, sorry, sorry. Yeah, you're right.
Cletus Cobbington 00:13:30 Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Uh, when I look, nevermind, that's
Dungeon Master 00:13:32 He could only do fire elemental, I believe, as it is the embered me. But you could give it up regardless. This is a very nice moment.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:44 Yeah, well, I'm just yeah, I'm just thinking that practically speaking, you'd get more use out of it than me because I did circle of the moon so that I could do that anyway. But I mean, if you want it. Yeah. Maintain concentration.
Cletus Cobbington 00:13:59 technical wild shape, right? Just wild shape rules. So like you can't cast spells and stuff within it. And that's standard. Right. Gotcha. Right.
Dungeon Master 00:14:04 yes you can cast spells before it and then go into it and maintain it yeah and then wild stripe yeah
Kaladen Shash 00:14:05 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:15 Yeah, that's usually what I do. Yeah, because you can maintain concentration while it's going. You guys want to take a short breath? Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:19 Oh, like cast a moonbeam and just. Fire elemental. Did we do any short rest after this fight? OK, I guess. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:14:28 I mean I wouldn't say no.
Dungeon Master 00:14:33 You have not rested yet, no. This is immediately after the fight. You did do some heals, but that was it. You cast some Cure Wounds and stuff.
Cyrus Schwert 00:14:38 I feel like we did some heals on each other and stuff, though, because we were way more hurt than that. Yeah, we're doing pretty good, really.
Kaladen Shash 00:14:42 Yeah. I was going to say I'm at full health right now. I missed my smell spot. Oh, yeah, okay. Yes. Wizard.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:46 Yeah, I did a mass cure wounds. So I divvied up like 40 or 50 hit points to everybody. Wizards can, can't they?
Leopold Magnus 00:14:56 Yeah, I think with a short rest, I might be topped off. I might be all right. I guess to change cantrips, that takes a long rest though, right? Okay. Oh, nice. Okay, cool. Yep.
Dungeon Master 00:15:06 If you can, most classes can't change their cantrips. Good for them. That's a good pick up.
Kaladen Shash 00:15:13 Yeah. That's why I have control water. I was like, we're going to the sunken city. I'm going to get this cantrip ready. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's good. I can recover. I can get a couple spell slots if we short rest. I'm already at good health. Spell slots are cool.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:24 I like that for saying I was just thinking I was like, I think I have that cantrip. Good call.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:25 Yeah. Yeah. Well, let's take a short rest then, right? And then I can get my wild shapes and then... Alright. Ugh.
Cletus Cobbington 00:15:30 Correct.
Dungeon Master 00:15:40 It has the look and consistency of cum. It's just like it's really milky and white as you push it together. I like the shape of it.
Cyrus Schwert 00:15:43 Cyrus pushes together some wet webs for a pillow. And it like squishes really grossly. And I lay my head down. It does not feel comfortable, but I can't sleep without a pillow. Yeah, I have to do this. I have to do this.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:59 Oh, don't tell me that. Oh. Yep. I'm just going to say he's way too familiar.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:59 Oh, who's Cyrus? What technology are you using over there? I'm going to take a sample.
Cletus Cobbington 00:15:59 Absolutely do not put your head on that. Oh, he's already asleep. That's insane. It's like he's done that before. That's weird.
Cyrus Schwert 00:16:17 Cyrus is notoriously the loudest snorer in the group. Good, good.
Kaladen Shash 00:16:19 yeah oh
Leopold Magnus 00:16:25 Jonathan, what would that material be called? Like a pillow come? Oh, spider silk, okay. Oh, it's going in there, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:16:28 Spider silk. I guess the technical term would be like condensed moist spider silk. But in parentheses. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:33 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:16:46 That rolls off the tongue for sure. After a short rest, my head lifts up and there's just a full indent in like very defined outline of where my head was. Like you can see all my ear
Kaladen Shash 00:16:47 Please put that in your inventory. Condensed moist spider.
Cletus Cobbington 00:16:55 That's awful.
Dungeon Master 00:16:56 Parenthesis, parenthesis, spider, end parenthesis, come, end parenthesis. That is correctly problematic. Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:15 That's coming back later. You guys know. Oh, Cyrus, that seemed awfully comfy. You were out quite readily. Wow, I might have to take this back. I bet you there's a lot of people in the Dome that would pay good money for such thing, assuming you've
Cyrus Schwert 00:17:15 Like one of those things with the little pegs where you can see your face or your hand or whatever. It's like that. Yeah, it really wasn't bad.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:25 Nasty.
Dungeon Master 00:17:29 Leopold the Robot is modest.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:43 and I kind of poke at it, found a cover for this situation.
Cletus Cobbington 00:17:48 Disgusted by texture.
Cyrus Schwert 00:17:49 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:57 I'm going to go over to Cletus, and I'm just going to be like, hey, I think you might use this a little better than me. I'm just going to take the flame-embroidered embered mane. I'm just going to unclip it. I'm just going to show it to you. And then, yeah, you can try it on. Yeah, yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:18:18 Well, does it have any other bonus stuff besides the elemental ? I mean, if it has bonuses, just keep it, because that's better than what you would turn into anyway. OK.
Dungeon Master 00:18:25 You should look it up and read it to see if you really want to learn it. And it takes both of the wild shapes, and his takes just one of them. His subclass is almost exclusively built for this in the endgame.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:27 I was. Yeah. Kind of, but it's only one elemental and I can do all of the elementals. Let me share it real quick. Yeah, and so it's not it's. There it is.
Kaladen Shash 00:18:29 Can you share it in the group chat?
Dungeon Master 00:18:55 The elementals are why people pick this one.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:57 Yeah, they're pretty OP. The extra fire damage, though, those will happen for any of your forms, but being able to do an elemental, there's no reason for me to be, like, a jaguar anymore, because I could be something that has, like, 100 more hit points. And so, you know. Practically speaking, I mean, you know, for pleasure, yeah, but not for fighting. Hey, I wasn't doing the Zara voice.
Cletus Cobbington 00:18:57 Gotcha. Sure.
Cyrus Schwert 00:19:14 I mean, a jaguar is pretty cool. Sex jaguar. This one's called Sex Panther. 60% of the time, 1% of the time.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:22 Jaguars for pleasures, Ariel? Let's see, let's see.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:28 That was out of game. 90% of the time, every time.
Dungeon Master 00:19:28 Every time.
Cletus Cobbington 00:19:29 OK.
Cyrus Schwert 00:19:45 Okay. So we're heading, so we're going to, so we're going to follow this water.
Kaladen Shash 00:19:51 Is our only option to essentially enter the water? Is that what it looks like? Yeah. How much water can you control? All right.
Dungeon Master 00:19:59 Yeah. You can go backwards. You can try to get past it. You guys have various ways to control the water. But you don't know if there's spider web on the other side. It might be flooded on the other side of the tunnel.
Zariel Torgan 00:20:06 I mean, we're gonna... Look. Let me take a peek. For some reason, I don't have the water elemental up.
Kaladen Shash 00:20:22 How much water can you control? Okay, so you said it was like 10 feet wide? Yeah. We could see at least what the other side looks like.
Dungeon Master 00:20:30 Um, I think it's always like five feet at a time. It's like your body size of water. Yeah. So you guys could clear the space.
Cyrus Schwert 00:20:31 Like, are we going to drown if we get stuck in the water? I mean, yeah, that makes sense.
Leopold Magnus 00:20:50 Good call, Stuart.
Cletus Cobbington 00:20:58 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:21:02 You do it. To make it fun to give me an intelligence, like an opposed intelligence check. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:21:04 I'll step up, I'll step up to the water and cast it, and a small tunnel will appear. Just for five feet, though, not deep enough. Like, just, like, with our intelligence modifier as a roll? A check. Yeah, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:21:39 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:21:42 22 you cast the spell to control the water in this space, but it's rushing so hard. And there's so much pressure that your tunnel kind of gets pushed almost out of frame of like what you can see because of the walls of the tunnel. But you managed to yank your little five foot depth area back into the center. And you feel like the mental strain of fighting this enormous, like well head pressure.
Cyrus Schwert 00:21:42 That's really good. Nice.
Kaladen Shash 00:22:10 is volume of water. Right, right. Zario, get over here.
Cletus Cobbington 00:22:13 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:22:14 But successful. You guys are looking at like a water tube that ends in water. It's five foot space. So it's not deep enough to get to the other side. Cyrus, give me a dexterity saving throw.
Cyrus Schwert 00:22:20 I step into it. This is crazy. Look, I'm like surfing. I'm catching a barrel. Oh, good. That's what I wanted you to say.
Zariel Torgan 00:22:21 All right, I'll move up.
Leopold Magnus 00:22:26 Oh, what's the diameter of the tongue that we're walking through?
Kaladen Shash 00:22:40 Someone move the water.
Dungeon Master 00:22:49 You did. God, I hope you see it. 11's fine. I want it to be low. You're, like, doing a gag bit, and your foot kind of goes out of his control space, and you almost get inked into the water. Your whole body ejects slightly a little bit before you, like, recover a little bit, and you have to kind of, like, eh, eh. That was funny. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:22:50 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:22:54 11. Whoa. Never turn your back on the ocean. No.
Leopold Magnus 00:23:17 I'm going to look over at Cyrus and I'm going to look over. I imagine his hair is kind of like wetted. Maybe you're trying a new look. And I'll just say, oh, Cyrus, new look, huh?
Kaladen Shash 00:23:17 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:23:17 Does his high-top all-star converts get ripped off? Sorry. Sorry, that's what I pictured on your feed.
Dungeon Master 00:23:19 no no no he maintains for sure he didn't fail yeah
Cyrus Schwert 00:23:26 My Chuck Taylors. Well, my hair is already wetted from the dense, moist spider's go. It's like gel. I just cannot get it off.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:30 Yeah, it's stuck straight up, like something about Mary.
Leopold Magnus 00:23:44 is it gonna like set you're just gonna have like that it's like permanent gel i'm gonna make another note in my notebook uh properties of this spider cum stuff acts like hair gel
Kaladen Shash 00:23:48 What's this? This condensed moist silk. What is this stuff? Curse.
Dungeon Master 00:23:49 I've got an angle like that. For sure. It should be C-U-M-S. There should be something in between.
Cletus Cobbington 00:23:49 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:23:56 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:08 All right, I'll move in. I'll do my water elemental wild shape, and then I'd like to move into the next area of space.
Dungeon Master 00:24:21 It's pretty fast.
Cletus Cobbington 00:24:21 you you
Zariel Torgan 00:24:33 I've got 90 feet per round of swim speed. Can I just poke one of my watery tendrils out past his control point and see roughly how fast it's moving? Is it faster than that? Does it feel more than twice as fast as that?
Dungeon Master 00:24:52 You, as a water elemental, feel like you would have good control regardless, but like it would be an active effort not to just kind of go that way. And you come. Go ahead.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:05 So I'm looking to try to like... Oh, go ahead. Oh, I was just going to say, I'm picturing, and you can tell me if this is something I could do. I want to create a pocket inside of my larger frame of still water, and I want to move past the end of this tunnel, move somebody through to the other side and eject them. Part of my things I can do as an elemental is I can surround somebody. Is that something I could try?
Dungeon Master 00:25:30 Yeah. You definitely can. Yeah. My god.
Cletus Cobbington 00:25:37 Little Azariel suit.
Leopold Magnus 00:25:38 It's gonna be like a little water park right here. Okay, so that's me. No one else can. Oh, sorry. What are you doing there? I don't I don't know if I'm comfortable with whatever's happening.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:38 Alright. Yeah, I'm gonna, like... I'll just unzip. I'll just gesture, because I don't think I can speak. I think I speak elemental. It's like...
Kaladen Shash 00:25:41 Yeah, someone that doesn't need to breathe should hop through there. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 00:25:51 holy hell
Dungeon Master 00:26:04 You got the mental connection.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:06 Get in my belly. Oh, okay. I'll say it. Hop on in. I'm just gonna... And I'd like to move to the edge where I can get to the end of the tunnel where Kaladin's made. And then I just want to push forward trying to get to whatever we think the other side is.
Cletus Cobbington 00:26:09 Haha.
Leopold Magnus 00:26:12 Oh, okay. I'll see you guys on the other side. And I'll just get this.
Dungeon Master 00:26:35 Mm-hmm. You push through, and there's not... It gets much less forceful in, like, the water current, but it kind of feels like it's kind of angling outward. And then as you go into this tunnel, you realize that there is, in fact, no spider webbing or anything, and it is fully flooded and, like, underneath this area. So it's, like, very forceful water this way. You guys are right here, and the other side is completely submerged.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:05 Is there any light to see? Are we just, like, hundreds of feet underwater? Oh, it's dark. Um... Hmm...
Dungeon Master 00:27:09 In the dark. Yeah. I imagine as a water elemental, you can kind of see in water. So like you can tell that it's a flooded tunnel and that the forceful way you don't know, but behind you was protected by the spider webbing. That's why you could say that. And the funnel, no, it bends eventually.
Cletus Cobbington 00:27:15 Hmm.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:32 Alright, and we don't see any end in sight. So, I'll just... Okay. I'll, uh... I'll relay to the group. Don't seem like any air around these parts. The old wet tube. What do you guys want to do?
Kaladen Shash 00:27:54 Excuse me, the way through? What are you talking about? There's you.
Cletus Cobbington 00:27:57 First off, awful too. Just inside Zariel and next to his wet tube.
Dungeon Master 00:27:58 Yep. Yes, you are. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:28:01 Am I still inside of you? I'm sorry. What are we doing here? I hope you didn't say licking. Can't hear you over these bubbles.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:11 We're looking. That was the whole plan. I don't have a tongue. I don't have a tongue. I'm a puddle. I'm going to go back. I'm going to come back.
Kaladen Shash 00:28:25 OK, do we feel like we want to go that way? Do we need to get everybody across, or what? What are we doing?
Cletus Cobbington 00:28:33 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 00:28:37 This dude got licked so hard he melted. He's a puddle. I'm a little scared of the water.
Dungeon Master 00:28:38 Sounds good.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:53 I'm going to keep my form just because I don't want to waste it, but I'll be mental. It seems like we're going to. I have a potion. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:29:00 So three of us... Yeah, I was going to say three of us need to be able to breathe. How long were the... I might have one or two potions. Okay. I didn't know if I could, like,
Cletus Cobbington 00:29:10 I mean, I can turn into a water thing. So
Dungeon Master 00:29:15 Anybody who has control water can... You can basically... I thought this was the plan. I thought you were going to collectively create an air pocket to travel with. Yeah. It's a cantrip, right? It lasts for a round. You can catch it every six seconds. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:29:29 I guess I could make it consecutively move like a foot forward. We can just do it over and over and over again. I'd think of it that way. It's a cantrip. Cast it over and over and over. I think whatever I mold, no. I think that's if I leave an animal or skull. I think it might last an hour if we just want to leave it in place, too. Yeah, let's walk towards it.
Cyrus Schwert 00:29:39 We can use movie magic and make it smoother. As long as I don't lose my converse, I'm okay.
Dungeon Master 00:29:55 Regardless, you could do this. I think you can only control your space in water. So, like, Zariel in his water element could be in water and have one extra person
Kaladen Shash 00:29:57 OK, so everybody would sort of have to be really tight to my space. So who? That's good. So everybody that doesn't need to be in the square? Because how many people would realistically fit in my space? OK, so that's my option.
Dungeon Master 00:30:25 And then, you know, people who can wild shape into animals can do that or alter selves or water breathing. Leopold doesn't have to breathe so he could cast it on somebody else.
Cletus Cobbington 00:30:31 Yeah, I got my handy dandy octopus form.
Zariel Torgan 00:30:32 Well, and Leo could guess... Well, do you have control water, Leopold? Yeah, that was my thought, but if he doesn't have it pulled up, then he can't do it. Um...
Kaladen Shash 00:30:32 Great, great.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:38 Set that up before we set out since we haven't long rested and switch it yet. We'd have to long rest, yeah?
Kaladen Shash 00:31:01 there you go walk on the bottom you could carry him somebody somebody should be
Zariel Torgan 00:31:01 Well, I could polymorph somebody. Yeah, you can breathe, but how are you going to get through this water? I guess I could carry you.
Cletus Cobbington 00:31:08 Well, he wild shaped, though. Well, it's a tunnel, eh? He can just walk.
Leopold Magnus 00:31:08 Well, if Cletus has his octopus and your water elemental, you can shape the water for Cyrus and then Kaladin can breathe on his own and I can breathe on my own. Oh, is that that's? Drag me along.
Kaladen Shash 00:31:30 Yeah, we're in a tunnel. It's not like it's wide open yet. Okay, let us all move forward.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:31 Okay. Yeah, I'll just carry him across. Alright. I'll just...
Dungeon Master 00:31:42 All right, mechanically, you guys can all get through. So once you're on the other side of the water jet, what would you guys like to do? It's tunneled. That's what he had seen earlier, is the dark tunnel, underwater, bends at some point, like just go somewhere. Hard to tell from here.
Cyrus Schwert 00:31:52 Is it just more tunnel? Let's just cook. That's what finding email happens.
Kaladen Shash 00:32:08 Yeah. I was wondering if that's the exit.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:08 Do you guys think that we were supposed to try to go through where it was really fast and just get swept away? Do you think that's what his plan was? Once everybody passes, if I use my movement and action, I can move 180 feet in the water.
Dungeon Master 00:32:18 There's no plan. This is all in the moment. We make it up together. Mm-hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 00:32:26 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 00:32:33 around and i just go back into the jet and just push my way following the current a little bit and see what happens over there see if anything i'm gonna check this out
Cyrus Schwert 00:32:44 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:32:48 We feel anything magical in the area. Like pulling the water towards it.
Dungeon Master 00:32:49 Yeah. Great question. We'll break it up into two parts to deal with it first. So, Ariel, how far would you be willing to go before you stopped as you're moving forward? Okay. Pretty cool. Yay. Go ahead and give me a perception check as you are...
Zariel Torgan 00:33:03 I'll go a couple rounds of movement. I'll go, what'd that be, like, 360 feet? No time at all. That's like 15 seconds, 12 seconds.
Dungeon Master 00:33:19 kind of like going with this flow of water pretty quickly but like in your head got a set distance 24 okay for the 24 you also get to give me a dexterity saving throw as you see it coming um the water is being pulled into this area and you can tell that it goes from being the full tunnel to kind of like
Kaladen Shash 00:33:30 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:33:33 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:33:44 slightly more narrow and you're hitting the very end and you see that all the water is being pulled into this like arcane teleportation space where it's just like getting yanked into 17 great um you sort of pull yourself out of the flow at the last second and you hit uh you're a water elemental but you're like on stone and you are staring at
Cyrus Schwert 00:34:05 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:34:06 at what looks like a reverse base of a fire hose, right? Like the water is so intense and it's white and it's all rapid and it's just getting it pulled into this tunnel instead. But at the very source, the whole room isn't flooded because it's being pulled in before it can fill the whole room. So you were just like watching this water get siphoned into this like flat arcane circle from the outside is what you can see. It's over like this stone well.
Zariel Torgan 00:34:38 Do I get the impression that if I was to carry somebody that wasn't magically affected, that they would survive if I wanted to bring them here and show them this? Can I... Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:34:48 Yeah. The hardest part was judging the distance and knowing to not get pulled in. And your checks allowed you to do that. So you could ferry people back and forth. Let me give you a generic final map so you can have something else to stare at. I just realized we're still on time.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:02 Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna go over the intercom. Like, hey guys, I think you'd like to see this. You guys wanna... Who wants to come first? You're just in there the whole time. It's like, oh shit, I'll just pop you out.
Leopold Magnus 00:35:24 Well, did I ever leave?
Kaladen Shash 00:35:25 She's like, what goes in there?
Cletus Cobbington 00:35:25 Theoretically, if someone hops in, could I grapple with my tentacles, the person that's in, and just swoop with them?
Dungeon Master 00:35:27 He's still in you. That is ridiculous. Yeah, you could.
Zariel Torgan 00:35:38 I'm like a large creature as an elemental, I think. Hmm.
Cletus Cobbington 00:35:58 I mean, as an octopus, I'd be large too, but I just mean to do even more checks. I got eight tentacles. Can I grapple everyone else? Hands aren't going to go together.
Kaladen Shash 00:36:05 Yeah, I'll just cast Alter Self on me so I can just breathe underwater. I'll take a free ride from somebody. That's an hour. That'll work for whatever we're doing. Oh my god. What a funny look.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:13 Yeah, I'll get everybody zipped over. So does somebody... Oh, go ahead.
Dungeon Master 00:36:23 You're just holding the whole group together. As you guys make your way through... No, go ahead. You got something.
Leopold Magnus 00:36:27 A lot of drag.
Cletus Cobbington 00:36:28 I'll be the glue.
Zariel Torgan 00:36:41 No, no, I was just going to ask if anybody else looking at this had a better grasp of what it was than me, because this isn't really my domain, but that was it.
Dungeon Master 00:36:49 Yeah, as you guys get there, I only have a map for something similar later, but it is this big open space, dark kind of room deep at the bottom, and it is like this enormous scale, but not like huge in itself, but just large slabs of stone like well in the ground with like these runes around it and hovering like two inches above that is a
Dungeon Master 00:37:17 almost perfectly thin but you can see like the runes of it glistening in gold um like on top of the well and the water goes up until it hits the runes and it doesn't disappear into the well it's just like blackness underneath
Leopold Magnus 00:37:36 So where did we come out in reference to that? Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:37:39 You were like, if the water is rushing this way, right, you guys came in and popped out to the side, and then you're like watching it go in at the source. And it only was possible if, because Zariel had passed before, normally it's in my head, everybody at the same time, maybe somebody gets ejected into wherever this is, but it was well thought out with this water element in form.
Leopold Magnus 00:38:05 OK, so the source is right in front of us. We're just standing
Dungeon Master 00:38:08 You are seeing one of your objectives. You don't know what it is or why it is, but you do see it. You are... Give me...
Cletus Cobbington 00:38:17 Hmm.
Zariel Torgan 00:38:18 so the odd thing about this is that it's sucking water in through this this teleportation circle are we to assume that it's going from here into the city because i thought we were kind of under the city already
Kaladen Shash 00:38:37 The domes, like, is this like just essentially like a drain? This is like a negative draw? So all that water that keeps pouring into the city just is drawn to this? Or is it filling from? Um.
Dungeon Master 00:38:37 everybody can participate. Unless somebody has an idea of what this is, you can give me just like an intelligence check. I'll give you a little nut. Go ahead and give me an intelligence check with that question too. I'll give you some information for that specifically.
Cletus Cobbington 00:39:00 you
Dungeon Master 00:39:06 If anybody wants to know something specific, let me know what you're looking for.
Kaladen Shash 00:39:10 Because I feel like we've got a chance to disrupt if it's just runes powering this teleportation circle, and this drain is essentially powering a waterfall somewhere else. I don't know if the water's being just sent some other dimension. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:15 That was my thought.
Leopold Magnus 00:39:25 Well, I guess my thought is if this is draining the water, then where is the water coming from, right? If you stop the drain, is the water just going to keep coming? Like, what's the source? Because this has been flowing uphill, right? Okay. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:39:42 The source is like a naturally occurring water system. Like a large river.
Cyrus Schwert 00:39:43 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:39:47 And probably at first there was some huge ecological like disruption, but with time it's balanced out that like the dome filled up and it's just this huge basin of water and water kind of like leaks out and refills on the sides and is absorbed into the ground and it gets refilled into the water. It's like it balanced out in some way, but like the natural source of the water is you guys had seen it on the way and it's like the river you were walking by.
Leopold Magnus 00:40:13 Okay. But one would think if we plug this drain, then the source of that water will fill the dome up even more.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:15 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:40:22 Well, if there's nothing pulling the water in, the water would, it would still probably be there for a while, but it would naturally flow back out. Cause it's, if you were in the home, the water, the water's going to level in the most natural way. So it would basically go to, you know, maybe an inch or two deep. Eventually the water would go away eventually completely.
Kaladen Shash 00:40:31 That's what I'm assuming, yeah. We want to just...
Leopold Magnus 00:40:46 Okay, I see what you're saying.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:47 so we we we would get the impression then just based on logic that somebody sabotaged this like this isn't something that you would naturally find i don't know not good like 11 10 10.
Dungeon Master 00:40:57 We'll go off of the checks, so we'll get into that. Cesaro, what did you get? Okay, 11. With a 10, you would realize, yes, if you disrupted these runes, it would cease to pull the water in because whatever this location is would close off.
Cletus Cobbington 00:41:05 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 00:41:11 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:41:23 That's what you get with a 10. Who is next on that? I'll just look. Calvin, 15. Cletus, 11. Cyrus, 18. Leopold, 12. Okay. Ohio State.
Kaladen Shash 00:41:27 I never did an investigation as to the intelligence.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:32 12. Oh, shoot. That's my bad. So that'll be even less. That'll be minus three. So nine.
Cyrus Schwert 00:41:44 None of my guns.
Dungeon Master 00:41:51 It's a fine average. It's not incredibly high, but it's not bad. You all figure out about the same thing, in that if you disrupt the runes, you could stop it, but the highest there being the 15... Yeah, because the 18 wouldn't count, right? Or the 18 count. Regardless.
Cletus Cobbington 00:42:16 I mean, what's your plus to investigation? Mine's the same for investigation and my intelligence. If it's the same, then it's the same.
Cyrus Schwert 00:42:17 That...
Dungeon Master 00:42:23 Perfect. That doesn't matter then. Regardless, 15 will get it though. What you guys then realize is that you would roughly be at the center of the city. And this would... It makes sense when you're looking at it. This seems like the equivalent of the core of New New Armor. Like this huge wellspring is just kind of ironically a well in this Fae city.
Dungeon Master 00:42:51 very play on words for Elven and Fey Realm-esque. But the runes on the outside of like the big well that's in front of you are not really lit. They're kind of faded and barely there. And this thing above it is, as you guys are sort of specifically asking, seems like a trap almost, like something activated it and it pulled it in, but there was no end point for the trap. It's just continually sucking something in.
Dungeon Master 00:43:21 As you guys are also in this room, you see, like, the investigation. Well, investigation with the 18 would get it. So everybody's sort of paying attention to this. Well, Cyrus, you kind of look around for a second and you see there's a lot of like natural moss and crawling ivy where there's not just all water. And a lot of them resemble human forms like.
Dungeon Master 00:43:47 just general body shapes on the ground kind of strewn around. And where it's not super thick on some area, you just see bones. Like this is just a long forgotten body down here. But one of them seems to be reaching towards this like rectangular shape near the wall on one of the sides of the room. Love that.
Cyrus Schwert 00:44:10 Hmm. Reminds me of like Pompeii. If all of us didn't see that, I relay that to the squad. They're like people. There's a box. There's a box on the wall. I mean,
Leopold Magnus 00:44:24 Oh, where? What? Oh, you suppose we should take a look? You're quite a strange adventurer, but let's take a look.
Kaladen Shash 00:44:27 You're talking about, look how good he did last time. He was slashing and cutting and jumping.
Cletus Cobbington 00:44:34 A box.
Dungeon Master 00:44:37 Talking telepathically is like our screaming with how loud the water is, too. It's absolutely roaring right at the base of you. You guys are yelling at each other in this room. And you walk over...
Cyrus Schwert 00:44:39 Why not? There's nobody here to get us in trouble or anything. I'm new. I'm serving a purpose to the team. I have a role.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:01 you you
Dungeon Master 00:45:07 it's like this console actually as he's pointing to it defending himself completely overgrown with foliage but it seems to be some sort of console boss
Cletus Cobbington 00:45:10 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:23 Excellent. Can we step up? Is there anything to read if we sweep off all this growth and whatever? Just seem...
Zariel Torgan 00:45:32 Yeah. As my water form, can I just like pressure wash all of it off?
Dungeon Master 00:45:37 Clean a lot of it off, yeah. It's very basic. A lot of the runes are destroyed with time. Not sure what they do, but you do see in the center glowing is like this orange fading in and out rune. Kind of just like almost throbbing in like the frequency and how it presents.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:54 A warning. Is there any other sense of instruction, control panel, gauge? It's just this one blinking rune.
Dungeon Master 00:46:08 No, in fact, there doesn't seem to be a lot of anything. There's a lot of stuff that was destroyed, so it's hard to tell what this was for, especially in this space. But when you are looking at this rune and with what Cyrus noticed as the form on the ground kind of reaching this way, it seems like the last thing that was put onto this console was whatever's in that.
Leopold Magnus 00:46:40 Like the coordinates to where that's going. So I guess can I interact with the orange orb or or maybe do a detect magic or something like that? OK.
Dungeon Master 00:46:43 something it's it's again you guys are walking into a room you've never been you brushed off the foliage and you see a glowing ruin so there's not a lot of context you can really get you can do like a detect magic
Cyrus Schwert 00:47:00 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:47:04 again so well
Zariel Torgan 00:47:06 Can I just go through real quick? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you know, I imagine I could swim back through. Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:47:11 the portal. Give me a dexterity saving throw with disadvantage. Sorry, give me a dexterity saving throw with disadvantage before anybody else can act.
Leopold Magnus 00:47:14 Well, you're just going to go blasting through that thing. Well, hold on. Now, if we're going to do that, I had an idea because I could cast. I could cast rope trick and the entire rope around you.
Zariel Torgan 00:47:38 Well, I am a water elemental. Alright. So that's 16 with disadvantage.
Dungeon Master 00:47:41 It is incredibly fast right here. 16. You got 16.
Cletus Cobbington 00:47:43 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:47:45 Repeat, we're way over your 180 per round. Flow rate's 300 and... Pretty good. Pretty good.
Cyrus Schwert 00:47:46 That is pretty good.
Dungeon Master 00:47:56 tall water kind of column-y shape that is Zariel's water elemental like sort of slides over to it and you see like one of his watery arms kind of touch to connect and it's instantly ripped into the thing and his whole body gets pulled into the portal. It will get to him in a second. What does everybody else want to do as that happens? You do sort of see him walk over and he just...
Kaladen Shash 00:48:15 What's he doing?
Leopold Magnus 00:48:19 Oh, dear. Oh, dear. I think I watched Ariel do that, and I have a little panic attack, but I know I need to figure out these controls. And I'm going to continue to do detect magic on it.
Dungeon Master 00:48:25 Like he gets sucked down a drain. Okay. We'll do what you do, but understanding that, sorry, you're acting at the same time. You're not just getting fucking ejected somewhere, but you get to do something. But as this happens, Leopold, you finish the detect magic, and it is...
Cyrus Schwert 00:48:35 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:48:54 divination magic but in the classification of like a um the way that you record spells and dialogue and stuff like it is um like divination is scrying and um sending and things like that like this is like some sort of um i don't know data dump
Cletus Cobbington 00:49:06 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:49:17 Would be an accurate description of from what you could glean from a spell, it would be like something is stored in there. It'd be a long process. You don't know that you have that kind of time, necessarily.
Leopold Magnus 00:49:17 information storage type deal i see is there a chance that it could be extracted like is there something maybe i could create to pull some of that data out of there i'll turn to the group and i'll say i have some ideas but it might take it some time what do you want to do
Cyrus Schwert 00:49:37 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:49:48 Okay, well, they figured that out. Sorry, y'all. You are instantly yanked through this thing, and there is an initial pressure of water at first, but as you get pushed through, the water kind of gets out of your face, your water element, so you kind of see through it. You find yourself...
Cletus Cobbington 00:49:51 Darn it.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:58 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:50:06 almost effortless as you are still kind of keeping relative speed that there's no pressure on you as you float through this black abyss of open space um looking ahead of you you see the portal etched into like nothing behind it as the water is pulling through and kind of like almost like
Kaladen Shash 00:50:19 yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:50:27 like a galaxy swirl kind of just spreads out and goes into like the huge space. And you look around and you see like distant glittering lights and twinkling of different energy light sources way off in the far expanse. But you, having talked about it somewhat recently with Paladin, would surmise that you are in the astral sea currently.
Zariel Torgan 00:50:40 Sweet.
Dungeon Master 00:50:58 back to the party. Leopold relays this information to you. What would you guys like to do with that? You don't know what Zariel knows.
Cyrus Schwert 00:51:09 I was really worried for a second when Zarya got sucked in, but I looked down at my feet and I was like, oh, thank God he's not wearing my Converse. I'm still wearing my Converse. So that's good. The canvas. Notorious for not trying.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:18 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 00:51:18 Those things take forever to try.
Kaladen Shash 00:51:18 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:51:32 Lena says, nodding agreeably.
Cyrus Schwert 00:51:39 So that was fucking crazy. Why did he do that? Do we just wait for him to come back? He's coming back.
Kaladen Shash 00:51:50 I don't know. I think he's coming back. I don't know what to do. The rune, there's no way to interact with the rune or take the rune with us. I want to touch the rune. Put my finger out.
Cletus Cobbington 00:52:00 I was going to say that too.
Dungeon Master 00:52:02 You can touch it. Perfect. Glad somebody touched it. You touch this rune and it throws up a silent image of a continuous stream of images that were captured as this rune was activated. You see
Zariel Torgan 00:52:05 Touch the butt. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 00:52:10 I'll get right back here.
Cletus Cobbington 00:52:30 I get startled and I ink. Oh, you guys made me ink. I'm so sorry. Keep going.
Dungeon Master 00:52:33 I forgot you're an octopus. It's on the floor. It's so wet, like a mop hitting dry floor sound. Just such an instant splat. As this happens, it's kind of crude the way it shows it, but this very large...
Cyrus Schwert 00:52:42 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:46 Clean up on aisle four.
Dungeon Master 00:52:59 shadowy figure is like scrolling through this tunnel that's not flooded at this point and there are tons of soldiers guarding it and this figure is just like waving their hand back and forth cutting everybody down and
Dungeon Master 00:53:14 like just they keep advancing no problem through the tunnel and like it takes a different view for a second like it's almost like a scrying orb that reports and you see there is a tall it's like very inky and big and shadowy but looks to be like a very tall elven figure standing in defiance they step out in front of this figure and you see standing next to them seems to be a um
Dungeon Master 00:53:37 like live somewhat thinner what seems to be like dragon born figure like it is very reptilian standing upright has a tail um but relative size of the tall elven figure so they're both tall but they stand to interpose this shadowy figure all silent you're just like seeing a recording this figure stops in front doesn't just outright to attack them and they stand there for a while almost as if they're having a conversation you can't
Dungeon Master 00:54:05 But as you guys are watching this, everybody who's watching it, give me a perception check. And we'll jump back to Zario to let you do something as well, too. What do you want to do? It's like sort of your first action in this space. Good. Roll Thedas. Dang. Get it out. Get it out.
Cletus Cobbington 00:54:20 Oh.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:21 So, I was, so, I mean, I'll probably try to, like, make my way back towards to get back out of here, but I'm a little fuzzy on, like, the physics of how if we stop a drain, that it would have any effect on getting water out of the dome.
Kaladen Shash 00:54:22 Excellent. Excellent. The map, get them out.
Leopold Magnus 00:54:25 Oh, that's a lot.
Cyrus Schwert 00:54:26 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:51 As I was assuming that this took us into the dome, like somebody found a water source and
Kaladen Shash 00:54:59 No, so it's got such draw that it can pull water into an area, like up a straw and back into the dome.
Dungeon Master 00:55:07 And let's touch on that because with a 27 being above the DC 25, Cletus, you're watching this. Again, it's like the primitive security footage kind of technology. It's like these little inky shadowy figures that you're watching that were recorded and are replaying. The...
Cletus Cobbington 00:55:26 There's some old TV.
Dungeon Master 00:55:28 There is the elvenish figure seems, you notice the smallest amount of detail. One of his hands sort of politely grasped in the other behind his back and he is like flicking his fingers very subtly and you can tell he is putting the final runes on a spell behind him as they are talking to this figure. And the dragonborn seems to also be doing some sort of magical spell behind her back that is
Zariel Torgan 00:55:35 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:55:58 like the equivalent of subtle cast, like being cast without being noticed, but you can't see what she's pointing at. Whereas the Elven figure seems to be pointing directly at the well behind him. Um,
Dungeon Master 00:56:11 and something happens and this very tall figure goes to strike them both down and almost like instantaneously you see water like explode from behind him and his little shadowy form gets like fully encompassed with water that is too fast to avoid and this like trap arcane runes activate in front of the well and yank and it pulls him in before he can get out and is ejected into nothing
Dungeon Master 00:56:36 And you see these figures were like launched to both sides and the whole thing. And they like the, the recording sort of ends before you see them get up. But then you like look up and you see that this water traveling into this space seems to be the aftermath of two separate spells. Um, Zario, as you try to get back in, give me a dexterity saving for with disadvantage to sort of fight the current back through.
Cletus Cobbington 00:57:02 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:11 15. 21.
Dungeon Master 00:57:12 15, having a hard time getting back in. But give me a perception check as you are sort of in this empty space. And then we'll cut back to everybody else with what you're doing. Anyone?
Dungeon Master 00:57:34 You see nothing seems close in this space, but there is like a weird distortion of light that's like a fairly large amount of it. Seems to be pretty close to you, like diagonally some amount of distance. Just seems like a lot of light is bending around some sort of object that you can't super see.
Cletus Cobbington 00:58:11 I have a question. Is the astral sea like water, or is it like space? I see. Right.
Dungeon Master 00:58:13 Yes. It is D&D space. You could, in theory, travel through the Astral Sea and hit different realms. You could find access to the Fey Realm, the Hells, the Abyss, the Celestial Planes, the Material Plane. All of it are technically connected in space.
Cyrus Schwert 00:58:17 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 00:58:45 The well that the water got pulled into, that's where it's draining, right? Now.
Cyrus Schwert 00:58:51 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:58:51 Who wants to do something next? We've got people on both sides. Not quite. You missed this part of the D&D campaign, so I'll explain it.
Dungeon Master 00:59:17 I'll do the original scene, actually, to see if it shows. But the continent that you guys live on has four central arcane wellsprings that life kind of flourishes. It was like the last gift from one of the Elder Gods before they left to keep people on this planet in safety.
Cyrus Schwert 00:59:29 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 00:59:34 Well,
Dungeon Master 00:59:39 the people collectively built these domes around the core as they started to call on them. And then the core being like pure magic fed the dome to keep it protective. So in new, new Arbor, the original city, it is like where the military government has built their like full basis operations around the core. Uh, and the party found like the source of it coming out of the ground and like this ancient, uh,
Dungeon Master 01:00:08 wellspring arcane glass tunnel thing this seems like this city's equivalent of it but you very distinctly don't see magic coming out of it like the core ejects a huge purple beam you don't really see anything coming out of this
Cletus Cobbington 01:00:24 OK, so one can assume I saw them do the magic that sealed the magic from the well. From the recording we just watched, the magic that they did summoned
Cyrus Schwert 01:00:28 Hello.
Dungeon Master 01:00:42 What was that? Yeah, good connection. You seeing this
Cletus Cobbington 01:00:54 to like was that put on the well or it just happened to like yeah
Dungeon Master 01:01:02 Where they very strategically put this rune set, this big arcane circle, is pulling the power of what would have been this Wellspring. Maybe an unforeseen effect, the Wellspring is feeding this arcane rune that is now continually pulling in water.
Cletus Cobbington 01:01:23 Right.
Dungeon Master 01:01:24 um and being druidic you kind of gather looking at that like recording and looking at this wellspring and looking at this trap um the spell that you guys did not see from the dragonborn that was like being cast it's something that you couldn't tell was like a summoning water spell of some kind like they had prepped all of this to trap the figure that confronted them um
Dungeon Master 01:01:50 is like a last ditch because this figure ended up like striking them down as he was pulled into this well everybody else that you can tell is dead and the dome did still kind of fall so this was sort of just like the last hoorah you guys are like in the final combat spot um and you're looking at like you're putting all the pieces together like a lot of things happened
Cletus Cobbington 01:02:07 Okay. Right.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:08 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:02:13 to make this happen, and the fallout of that is now the dome flooded on accident. But there's nobody living there, so it doesn't matter. You know that the Cursed King sieged the city, and that he was eventually defeated in Moonhaven, but the details about that are pretty fuzzy.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:21 So it seems like they did that in self-defense of the dome against some larger enemy. I see. So maybe it wouldn't be too far of a stretch to say that was like the cursed king that got pulled in.
Dungeon Master 01:02:47 I would say that that wouldn't be too far of a stretch. Sorry, give me a dexterity saving throw with advantage. As you do see...
Leopold Magnus 01:02:51 Okay. Well, I guess seeing as Ariel disappear into that, I will do a rope trick spell and I'll throw the slack of the rope into the water.
Kaladen Shash 01:02:51 one.
Cyrus Schwert 01:02:53 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:03:10 I mean, and then simultaneously, Leopold, give me, what is your intelligence base, Catherine? Give me an intelligence saving throw as your magic has to fight this very powerful spell.
Dungeon Master 01:03:21 Zoro, great. You pull yourself through and I'm going to say whatever you roll, Rex won't even matter because 28, great roll. Zoro, you almost feel like your watery flesh is being yanked off your form. It is so strong. This spell very specifically designed to keep things from getting back through. It was an inescapable trap.
Leopold Magnus 01:03:22 Okay. Oh, hell yeah. 28.
Cletus Cobbington 01:03:24 Thank you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:03:36 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:03:44 So you were like one little water tendril after the other crawling up this thing. And eventually you kind of like leak out the side of it as you break back through to the material plane. And as that happens, Leopold had held his spell just long enough with the 28 that the rope gets yanked into the Astral Sea and the water all explodes forward. But with... Oh, no, it wouldn't. That wouldn't happen. You guys didn't dispel it. The water's still rushing in incredibly fast.
Cletus Cobbington 01:04:15 Yeah. Welcome back buddy. He's forgotten how to talk.
Dungeon Master 01:04:15 But Zariel is no longer in a different dimension. What specifically? Light bendy light or a
Zariel Torgan 01:04:19 I didn't like it over there. It's cold. We should... Yeah, empty, black, light, bendy light. Um...
Cyrus Schwert 01:04:20 It sounds like you were dead.
Leopold Magnus 01:04:23 What was going on? What could you see? Jonathan, can I make a history check? Would that ring any bells for me? Black and bendy. Yeah. Just as...
Dungeon Master 01:04:45 fake black darkness um same same answer that i gave jesse um you guys talked with kaladin recently enough because he's been telling you about his dreams um and that he had sort of found out that he was in the astral sea um just by description so when zoro describes this to you
Dungeon Master 01:05:06 it doesn't escape you that it does sound like the astral sea. And it, I don't think it escapes Kaladin spaceship specifically that when he says light sort of bent and you couldn't see the source of it, that when, and when the time you woke up in that sort of dream space, you were standing on like this black reflective glass surface where light sort of like scatter and bent as you walk through this constructed, um,
Cletus Cobbington 01:05:12 Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:05:28 Hmm. Hello.
Cyrus Schwert 01:05:34 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:05:35 structured, like house. No!
Zariel Torgan 01:05:42 Yeah, there was floating hot dogs too. I'm still a wet boy.
Cletus Cobbington 01:05:46 Oh, shit, I jumped in the portal. No, I'm kidding. What you got, a hot towel, buddy? Could I... Okay. Um...
Kaladen Shash 01:05:59 can we can we just negate the runes that are placed over there like there were the brighter gold ones if we disrupt that will that negate the trap
Leopold Magnus 01:05:59 Well, folks, do not touch that water. And I hit Zariel on the shoulder, maybe just a little too hard, and he goes flying again.
Dungeon Master 01:06:07 Yeah, go ahead and give me, this is just an intelligence check, but this can be sort of a group effort. Anybody who assists reduce the DC by two.
Cletus Cobbington 01:06:24 I will
Cyrus Schwert 01:06:26 I would love to help.
Dungeon Master 01:06:35 If you have ways to bonus it with dice rolls and stuff, this is DC 25 to dispel this arcane trap. Intelligence trap. DC 23.
Kaladen Shash 01:06:43 You said an intelligence check or an arcana. What did you say? Intelligence check. I will try harder. Great. That's like barely...
Cyrus Schwert 01:06:54 My hands on. You can do it.
Cletus Cobbington 01:07:01 I'll cast guidance. Just make him super, super comfortable.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:07 I'd like to help by making the water that is me, like a jacuzzi hot tub level, warm, and just surround his body, you know, from like the chest down, so he's nice and warm.
Dungeon Master 01:07:08 You get a D4. Azariel helps by making you soaking wet for the first time. You are soaked through your clothes. But it's so nice. It's a DC 21. You have
Kaladen Shash 01:07:22 Like warm pee. What did you, what did you have?
Leopold Magnus 01:07:30 Wowee.
Cyrus Schwert 01:07:34 Actually, I enhance ability. I enhance ability on Kaladin instead. It just gives you... Yeah, it's just advantage. Enhance ability for your intelligence checks or whatever it is.
Dungeon Master 01:07:37 Okay, DC 23. Is that advantage? Fox is cutting or something. Okay. Advantage, a D4, DC 23.
Kaladen Shash 01:07:53 Okay. Okay, so advantage on this one.
Cyrus Schwert 01:08:05 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:07 Does that include me helping out? Well, I was going to try to look at some of the runes and maybe find a source to point him towards so that way he can help with his spelling. Oh, bummer.
Dungeon Master 01:08:10 What did you do? It would have been a DC 21, still a failure. You guys get another check, another try at it if you want, but it's now a DC 27 base.
Kaladen Shash 01:08:23 Yes, it would still fail All right Am I that's what I'm saying, let's just destroy the rooms Why not Yeah, so I only have a plus four to my role naturally so maybe you should give it a go and
Cletus Cobbington 01:08:26 hmm.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:34 Did we just destroy this thing? Yeah, let's just fuck it up.
Leopold Magnus 01:08:39 I mean, I might as well try one more time before we do that, right? I got a plus five. Okay. It's a 27. Also, we could just totally leave it to chance and I could flip the all or nothing coin. Let's see what happens.
Cyrus Schwert 01:08:52 Honestly, better odds. Yeah, because intelligence checks are stupid, like we can't use proficiency. So the max is going to be five.
Kaladen Shash 01:08:53 I will assist. I will assist with you as I've attempted one. Great.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:04 Isn't that technically a better? Yeah, because I've got a plus five. We need a DC 20. Yep. I'll do that. And I will say I have this. What's that?
Dungeon Master 01:09:04 At D4, you can reduce it by four in total.
Zariel Torgan 01:09:16 You could inspire him. Oh, I was just saying, Cyrus could inspire. Then it's a d8, isn't it? Mm-hmm. I thought so at this level. You're level 10, right?
Cyrus Schwert 01:09:26 Josh, that would have made sense. Oh, I do we get bardics? Do I get bardics back on short rest? Yeah, it is pretty short rest. That's convenient. Okay, yes.
Kaladen Shash 01:09:28 Yeah, that's that's a really good bonus. Not going to board. I was doing better.
Dungeon Master 01:09:40 I don't know. Eventually you will, but I don't know if you have it yet. The D4s don't stack. There would be one D4.
Zariel Torgan 01:09:50 Yeah. Bards are fucking crazy. I could also do Guidance rather than a Hot Tub, and that'd be an extra d4. Oh.
Kaladen Shash 01:10:01 That's really good. So, DC down. Well, bardic inspiration, different than that D4, right? So, we're helping. So, two of us are helping to lower the DC. And minus four.
Cletus Cobbington 01:10:02 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:10:12 Well, you got guidance from Cletus. That's how he helped. You have your roll, plus a d4, a d8, and then however Zarya wants to help, he can go from 27 to 25, and then 25 to 23 if Kaladin helps. So dc23 with a d4 to d8. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:17 So what would be the total ad? Oh, okay. Plus the DA and D4. Okay. I should probably just roll that straight up. Should we do that?
Kaladen Shash 01:10:36 Yeah. That's true. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:10:42 We might as well rip that. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:10:46 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:48 All right, I have the blueprints for the arcane splitter. And I think maybe I'm going to take some inspiration from those. And I'm going to try to create a very narrow magical beam to try and separate the magic off of the physical rune, maybe like a little scalpel to try and extract that. Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:10:57 yeah i love that i'm gonna give you dm inspiration you get an advantage on that role that's very clever you designed the magical device that broke the dome on your city that's very very smart
Zariel Torgan 01:11:17 Nice.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:17 OK, cool. Yeah. All right. Advantage. Cool. Oh, I think one of those will get me there. Yeah, with a 21 and then it would be a D4 and a D8. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:11:19 At minimum, they're there once.
Dungeon Master 01:11:32 Okay. A 16 plus five is 21 plus a D4 and a D8. Yeah, you could get there. I just want to see what you get. Nine.
Kaladen Shash 01:11:39 22, 23. I'll say 29. Cleared the bar no matter what.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:47 Yeah. Perfect. Nailed it. 29. Yeah. Awesome.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:51 I...
Cyrus Schwert 01:11:52 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:11:54 um first time didn't work that the spell almost like pushed you all away like it had like a defense mechanism built into it um leopold kind of hovers underneath it the most delicate he can and you see like his finger gets held up to one very specific rune finger opens up at the tip as the gauntlet opens and this hyper beam of blue energy just like fears out and starts like
Dungeon Master 01:12:20 plasma cutting the rune at a very intricate point. Just this high-pitched whining before it cuts through the top and the whole spell sputters and goes out. And this is what happened before that I preemptively described. But with Leopold right there, the water losing the focus, comes crashing into the room, knocks you into the wall as the water sort of splashes. But you see that with the dissolving of that spell,
Cyrus Schwert 01:12:31 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:12:50 the magic means that the water's been getting pulled into the city, like, breaks. And almost instantly, it's not gone, but you see the water doesn't fill up anymore and seems to, like, naturally want to automatically correct the gradient and is, like, instantly reversing itself towards the place that it's leased and that is outside of the dome.
Leopold Magnus 01:13:17 Cool. Well, I think this may have done it. And you just hear this. And everything happens.
Kaladen Shash 01:13:28 Excellent. Very good.
Dungeon Master 01:13:29 You guys have. And that is the room that you see that I changed it to would be more accurate now. It takes a minute or two, but it's not that dense. But you see this very flickery, light, intermittent...
Cyrus Schwert 01:13:36 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:13:44 blue sort of sprites they kind of look like at first like just kind of dancing up little ashes up into the sky and we get a little bit more consistent and like you see the magic seems to sort of like naturally be coming out of the wellspring and floating just upwards like it's already sort of correcting itself very weak at this point
Zariel Torgan 01:14:14 Alright, now we just gotta get to the transportation circle. What's left?
Leopold Magnus 01:14:22 Well, hold on. Shall we take off so quick, or should we take a look at this? Well, didn't we gain some pretty powerful abilities last time we interacted with the Wellspring? Well, shall we take a look?
Kaladen Shash 01:14:31 Just the whale spring. Is there anything to take? Last time you stuck your fingers in there, and I just got stress points. You got something good. You captured the whale power. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:14:47 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:47 This is why he's saving the all or nothing coin. Yeah, that's kind of the gist I got was that it was like kind of wispy. He's snack man.
Dungeon Master 01:14:49 So, this is much too weak for that. Like I described, this is very weak. It's like an insignificant amount of magic coming out of this at this point. ...
Cletus Cobbington 01:14:51 You put your finger in and an almond appears in your other hand and I sneak away into the shadows.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:02 I see. Guys, did you see this? It still has some power. Look. Can I do it again?
Kaladen Shash 01:15:02 Broken. Excited.
Dungeon Master 01:15:21 You stick your finger in it and even like, even at its weakest, it is still like raw planetary magic. You start regaining hit points, you know, like one per second kind of equivalent up to your max. It naturally heals you.
Cyrus Schwert 01:15:37 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:39 Does it do anything for my spells, my arcana? Nothing? OK. I see. Cool.
Dungeon Master 01:15:44 No. Too faint for that. But a nice little healing bonus. Yes, my son.
Cletus Cobbington 01:15:56 Teacher, could I... I don't know if this is a possibility since I don't necessarily have the spell, but could I put a handful of almonds into them and see if I can get magic-soaked almonds and maybe they turn into good berries? You know, a little plus one almond?
Kaladen Shash 01:16:21 Yes. Plus one HP. So good.
Dungeon Master 01:16:23 Yeah, I like that. Good berries last for like the day or something like that.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:25 Nice. It's property of a good berry. Nice. You'd eat like 10 handful almonds.
Cyrus Schwert 01:16:25 There's a preach bell.
Cletus Cobbington 01:16:28 Mad magic. Oh, yeah, I guess that is. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:16:48 Yeah, well, so you have like 10 good berry equivalent of almonds that will be functional until your next long rest.
Cletus Cobbington 01:16:59 Wow. Healthy almonds. Healthier almonds, I suppose. Wow. That was wonderful. I give one to Chip. He's got to soak this up to create my next invoked almond. Extra juicy. He's salivating.
Zariel Torgan 01:17:03 As opposed to.
Cyrus Schwert 01:17:04 I roasted. Oh my god, he's slobbering. He's getting...
Dungeon Master 01:17:17 He looks directly at Cyrus. He kind of like points to you like, this is for you next. Shakes his little head and points right at you like a little double and like, it's coming to you, man.
Cyrus Schwert 01:17:34 There's no guarantee that he's gonna choose me to have it. No, I don't want it. It's gonna be extra wet.
Cletus Cobbington 01:17:38 I don't remember who had it last. Or did I invoke it? Or was it invoked for me last session? That's right. Yes, yes, yes, yes. That's right. Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:17:53 And you invoked it before the challenge, like the trials. So it's been burnt for what has been your very long days.
Cletus Cobbington 01:18:08 All right. Cool. Was there any other task in Moonhaven for us? I know we were supposed to figure out what was up with the whole water situation, but it was...
Zariel Torgan 01:18:26 Did we level up? It's been like three weeks.
Dungeon Master 01:18:27 You've done the big thing, which was figure out the water. The next thing that you think you would have to do is sort of find a way back home, like reopen the teleportation ability. You leveled up like in that previous fight. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:27 well there so i guess yeah at a level 10. uh
Kaladen Shash 01:18:31 Yeah. The seconds activate.
Cyrus Schwert 01:18:46 We just did recently. That was this morning. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:57 I guess my question was, Kaladin, your dream included seeing the tree of life and drinking from that fountain. Is that nearby?
Zariel Torgan 01:18:59 Thanks.
Cletus Cobbington 01:19:03 um
Dungeon Master 01:19:05 Yeah. Kaladin had this insane vision of drinking from the Wellspring. That is a great point that you bring that up. Drinking from the Wellspring and then traveling to this mystical tree to do some ritual.
Cyrus Schwert 01:19:22 Ever the pragmatist. We're changing the prophecy to almonds.
Leopold Magnus 01:19:24 Okay, yeah, I'll turn to Kaladin and I'll say, oh, Kaladin, weren't you saying something about taking a big long drink from a wellspring like this?
Dungeon Master 01:19:34 Leopold ever the enthusiast. That's the great memory. The ancient prophecy of the death and life tree now include soaps often.
Kaladen Shash 01:19:34 yes it's figurative i think nut butter a nut butter smoothie
Cletus Cobbington 01:19:41 I blend up the juicy almonds into a nice magic smoothie. Hey, I think we've confirmed that almonds are alive. Or is that just me? Right, right? Chip dabs me.
Leopold Magnus 01:19:59 Oh, man.
Cyrus Schwert 01:20:00 Blue diamond. That's pretty much just you.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:02 I don't know how we're not sponsored yet.
Dungeon Master 01:20:04 You see that when Leopold had kind of been sticking his finger in it and playing around in Cletus too, they seem to just be like,
Kaladen Shash 01:20:06 Can I interact? Can I interact with the wellspring current at all? Like put your finger in it. Is it it's engaged differently than healing?
Cletus Cobbington 01:20:11 All right.
Dungeon Master 01:20:29 like almost wispy smoke like it passes through and around their form they kind of like disrupt it and it kind of flows one way um you see that it's a tiny bit different for you but with cletus also actually so both cletus and kaladin um
Dungeon Master 01:20:53 you see that when you are like interacting with this magic that it's got a little bit more of like a fluid texture to it. Yes, you can.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:00 Crank it. Like spider silk.
Kaladen Shash 01:21:04 Can I, yeah, I'll palm some in my hands and suck it up. I do this. I don't know, just like nothing.
Leopold Magnus 01:21:20 Oh, that's something new. How'd it taste?
Dungeon Master 01:21:29 It tastes like Baja Black. It's just kind of refreshing enough that it's like really familiar to you. You can. Does anybody... Do you want to try the bottle? Yeah. I'll see if like
Kaladen Shash 01:21:30 Can I bottle some of this in an empty beer bottle? I want to capture some of this.
Cyrus Schwert 01:21:38 The celestial form. Here, try this.
Cletus Cobbington 01:21:41 Can I pass him a silly straw?
Leopold Magnus 01:21:57 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:21:59 You have an empty bottle from one of your potions. You see that you sort of turn it upside down, and the magic kind of just flows into it, and you eventually fork it, turn it over, and you have this, like, swirl of, like, raw, swirling blue, like, magic mana. In this downtime, nothing...
Kaladen Shash 01:22:02 yeah okay and then no no effect immediately yet okay
Cletus Cobbington 01:22:17 Wow.
Dungeon Master 01:22:26 um no you feel because when you had seen the prophecy before um it almost felt like you figured it out and you you like it asked me if you like you had to write it down and it's one of those situations where it's almost like you just know that if you started this process you would kind of know what to do at each step without knowing what to do you feel like you've accomplished like the first check box on this process
Cletus Cobbington 01:22:56 Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:22:58 okay and that person i don't know you should
Zariel Torgan 01:23:03 So, are we taking a rest? Or... Oh, go ahead. Sorry. Alright. I'll go over.
Dungeon Master 01:23:13 Sariel, you feel a slight draw to the well as well. Pop in. It's like infinitely deep
Cyrus Schwert 01:23:22 Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:23:27 Listen to the draw.
Zariel Torgan 01:23:31 I just hop in. Yeah, I bet it's been going really good. Well, I'll keep a hand on the edge. I mean...
Dungeon Master 01:23:44 not really water. It's like magic. Okay. You like kind of dip your body and holding it. You are not really in who you would be. Are you still a water elemental? Are you out of that? Up to you. It just presents different ways. I have two different descriptions I can do for it. They're both about the same. One gives you more questions, I think.
Cyrus Schwert 01:23:52 It's infinitely deep.
Cletus Cobbington 01:23:58 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:04 Which one's harder for you? Okay, I'll... I'll be the... I'll be the me, normally. I'll drop the L out to form, since the water's going away.
Dungeon Master 01:24:16 Okay, robot Zariel sort of dips his form in and you see that his chest, which has never done anything like this before, he always has sort of this like magic glow to him as like an automaton. You see that like it opens a little bit and his whole hue kind of dampens down and goes a little bit
Leopold Magnus 01:24:21 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:24:39 bluish as you see like a small amount of this wisp sort of absorbs into his body and then like the opening closes and you can tell that something deep inside of you is storing it sorry sure
Zariel Torgan 01:24:53 Hmm, like AIDS. Okay. Yep, magic. Does it feel familiar at all? Does it feel like when I touch the last thing? Or is this totally different?
Cyrus Schwert 01:24:58 Right. Magic Johnson.
Leopold Magnus 01:24:59 You got magic aids. That's the good kind.
Kaladen Shash 01:25:12 It felt similar to the condensed moist spider silk.
Dungeon Master 01:25:16 Give me an insight check on yourself. Nah. 18's good, though. An 18's not so good that you get everything, but you, with this in your body, feel like this is what
Zariel Torgan 01:25:24 Know thyself. Do I get advantage because it's me? 18.
Dungeon Master 01:25:46 I'm going to word it very carefully, what your body was made to do.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:54 Interesting. Okay. This specific type of magic. This is the second one I've done now of these. This wellspring magic. I got a boon of some type. Yeah, it
Cletus Cobbington 01:25:57 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:25:58 absorb magic.
Kaladen Shash 01:26:01 Did you store some magic when you touched the other one too? Or did you absorb some of it when you touched the previous? That's when you got your stress point five. That's cool. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:26:20 It absorbed into his body. That was his stress point. So he also manifested, but it was described as like he had touched it and it had traveled up into his arm, into his form.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:25 Interesting. Okay. I'll pop out and kind of shake off.
Dungeon Master 01:26:45 If you were a water elemental, they would have just seen this little ball of magic swirling somewhere in the center of your body. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
Cletus Cobbington 01:27:00 Someone's squirt. I'm sorry. I was thinking of two things. Someone squeezed a little bit of the Mio water shit in the middle of him. Wow. You're looking refreshing right now. Oh, God.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:08 Instead of taking a long rest, just... Yeah, just full of Mio energy. While just getting caffeinated up. So... Well, we should probably decide what our next step is. I mean...
Kaladen Shash 01:27:09 Just.
Dungeon Master 01:27:13 He's like a water latte artist. Worldly prettily. Well, you guys, what would you like to do?
Leopold Magnus 01:27:28 Are we taking a long rest here?
Kaladen Shash 01:27:38 I don't know if we want to activate the circle. That means they could travel to this area. They'll know if we can use that one to go somewhere else.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:39 Well, I don't know that they'll know we came from here. You know, we could have just said we used a spell and teleported back. Plus, I mean, there wasn't like a guard that wasn't friendly.
Dungeon Master 01:27:54 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:28:04 Hmm. And
Leopold Magnus 01:28:04 Wanted for murder, yes, and kidnapping.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:09 When we left, they were friendly guards. Nah. Nah. Well, didn't we get the impression... Didn't we get the impression, though, that he had said that they took over and were killing everybody, but... Look at this.
Kaladen Shash 01:28:12 Right when, maybe not now, I think we're wanted people by some siblings, kids. Open arms. So friendly.
Dungeon Master 01:28:39 There was like, is there stuff in the chat now? We're kind of breaking now, but it's nice. Well, only a little bit. Sorry, what was the question? Oh, yes.
Cletus Cobbington 01:28:43 You're muted, Trev. It's my water of the day.
Kaladen Shash 01:28:45 to meet the images.
Cyrus Schwert 01:28:46 Thank you for telling me. It's not worth it. It's a video. At the break, it's worth the watch. It's like a minute. I've seen it before. I just pulled it up.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:51 Okay. All right. Yeah, I was just saying, didn't we get the impression that he had said, like,
Dungeon Master 01:29:07 There was an initial outbreak where the Lycans had stormed the city, and there was a standstill fight between the Legionnaire and these werewolves. But the most recent update you got has everything had been...
Dungeon Master 01:29:24 sort of quelled. The werewolf threat had been sort of extinguished in that it seemed like the Lord of Advancement had sort of taken a temporary hold on power and had like unleashed his war-forged legionnaire army that are like patrolling the streets, keeping them safe but the last thing you got is it felt like a military regime had taken over.
Zariel Torgan 01:29:35 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:29:54 So the city is technically peaceful, but the last thing you knew you were wanted by the Lord, Marshall, not just the Lord, you are wanted by God. Um, but you don't really know that if everything has been settled, that you would still have been wanted. You had just been given the hint from the creepy space uncle that, um,
Cletus Cobbington 01:29:54 No.
Zariel Torgan 01:30:16 I mean... Well, I mean... I don't think we normally trust anybody, but... I mean...
Cyrus Schwert 01:30:17 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:30:22 You should have retraced your steps to seek out the deceit and that you shouldn't trust the First Council. So you've gotten some mixed messages. I would say that's pretty cool.
Cletus Cobbington 01:30:37 Hmm.
Zariel Torgan 01:30:44 What's the benefit of coming all this way and then not fixing it, going all that way back, fixing whatever problem is there? We still got to come back and then fix the teleportation circle.
Kaladen Shash 01:30:56 We can fix it, but then they... Everyone also knows that they can travel to it, right, if we turn it back on? That's what I'm assuming. Okay. Then...
Dungeon Master 01:31:06 On unclear. No, you would have to try to target it to teleport to it to know that you couldn't. Great way of looking at it.
Zariel Torgan 01:31:08 Yeah, I mean, do we get the impression, based on the teleportation circle that we were at, that it, like, just goes like... And it's just, like, obvious that it works versus just a static thing that you can... Yeah. You know, that was kind of my thought. You don't know to... You can't call a phone number that doesn't work if it hasn't worked, and you wouldn't have any reason to try. Unless they saw us come through, I guess. But we could say we came from anywhere.
Kaladen Shash 01:31:33 I think you have to be at the circle. I think you have to be familiar with it to land on it. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:31:35 Yeah. And don't you have to know of the specific landing point? Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:31:36 Yeah, you have to like wizards fully draw out the circles like every single rune. And when they want to go to a circle, they know they like draw out the circle for that.
Zariel Torgan 01:31:57 Yeah, we could just lie and say, you know, we got the water figured out, but the teleportation circle was a bitch. But we knew yours and it works, so we came home. You know, until we get to the bottom of what's going on.
Kaladen Shash 01:32:09 Yes. I'd like this. Yeah. So now we need to go head upwards of some of that. So now we need to get up to some control area where we assume the teleportation circle would be. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:32:15 Muted again. Get up to the city, eh?
Dungeon Master 01:32:15 Travis is still muted. What was Travis saying?
Zariel Torgan 01:32:30 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:32:30 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:32:38 um don't we feel like god quote quote knows like would know when something is open like that like is he he's not like an is he an all-knowing being kind of situation or is it like i don't know lord marshall guy like all not like all knowing
Dungeon Master 01:33:00 I just misspoke. He's not actually the Lord. The Lord Marshal is like the four-star general of the U.S. There is the structure of the domes of the government figures. It's the First Council, which is the number one mage in the city, trusted with most of the power, who kind of controls the High Council.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:07 Lord.
Cyrus Schwert 01:33:09 Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Then I like the plan.
Cletus Cobbington 01:33:18 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:33:26 Which consists of the Lord of Advancement, the Lord of, you know, whatever I call it, the Cleric Ones, the Lord of Currency, all that stuff. So the Lord Marshal is one of the Lord. I just called him the Lord at first. I was like, oh, not the Lord. The Lord Marshal.
Leopold Magnus 01:33:32 Oh, hey, sorry, aren't you forgetting something?
Zariel Torgan 01:33:41 And now we gotta go up in the city and find it. Uh, usually. Yeah, I'm not...
Cyrus Schwert 01:33:41 Got it. I like the plan, though. Figure out how to do that. Oh, no.
Cletus Cobbington 01:33:48 Yep. Oh, fuck the kennel.
Leopold Magnus 01:34:02 You're just going to leave behind your two new wolf pups out on that beach there?
Zariel Torgan 01:34:10 I'm not going to go get them until we solve this. I'm going to have to be going out, come back in, going back out. It's only been like three hours, hasn't it? Twice? Oh, those dogs are...
Dungeon Master 01:34:20 It's been a full day. You guys have long rested in the spider tunnels twice. You set up the automatic feeder thing with the blood and spork. They just have been in there a while.
Cletus Cobbington 01:34:27 yeah i think this is the third session since we set it up you know dirt holds smell real well it's gonna be rank
Cyrus Schwert 01:34:29 Yeah we've been there a while. You're an awful parent.
Kaladen Shash 01:34:31 yeah we got we got time
Leopold Magnus 01:34:34 Yeah, dog shit's piling up. Oh, my God. You don't even want to check on him, huh? In the arms of...
Zariel Torgan 01:34:38 Yeah, but that's normal, so they're cool with that. Alright, um... I mean... Don't we...
Dungeon Master 01:34:53 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:34:57 I mean didn't we say we were like nicely abandoning them when we left them that's all that matters not the lives of these poor creatures
Cyrus Schwert 01:34:58 I'm gonna call the ASPCA on your ass. This is, like, totally abused. You're gonna be on a Sarah McLachlan commercial. Quick. We already left the kids.
Leopold Magnus 01:35:04 Angel. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:11 Yeah, we put a lot of work into it. I can't leave this guy's kids. We need leverage. So, don't we get the... Didn't we get the impression that it's still full of water? It's, like, slowly gonna go away? So I can't, like... Yeah, so I can't, like, get them.
Dungeon Master 01:35:30 The dome is not drained yet. Now you are like in the back end. If I go back to the full map of whatever the districts was, take you guys with me. I'll kind of dot where you figured the core kind of was. So last you guys had checked, you were sort of under the spider nest in the Sylphane district. You knew that the kind of the wellspring was
Zariel Torgan 01:35:59 Yeah. Yeah, now.
Dungeon Master 01:35:59 in the corner of like, or more of like over here, like in the Alerian district. So you have made your way underground to that point, but you entered way down here at bottom left. So you'd have to traverse the entire city, which would take like a full day because it's such a large expanse. Should be like the last thing you do.
Cyrus Schwert 01:36:06 We'll see you in a couple days, Ariel. We'll be here.
Kaladen Shash 01:36:19 Yeah. Yeah. I'll be right waiting.
Zariel Torgan 01:36:29 Where I come from, dogs, they can handle their time alone. I'll get them later. I trained... Yeah, yeah, they got an auto-feeder. It's full of rancid mates. Ironically, we're both robots, so... It's like...
Dungeon Master 01:36:31 Leopold is guilt tripping the fuck out of you.
Leopold Magnus 01:36:40 Well, at least we can tell the dad they're taken care of well. I'm just staring at my hands again.
Kaladen Shash 01:36:53 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:36:59 Yeah. I mean, we'll get them before we roll out. You know? I mean, they will or they won't. So... Yeah. They're probably having a great time.
Dungeon Master 01:36:59 You made existential crisis.
Cletus Cobbington 01:37:03 Wait, fuck, how many days worth of food did we leave?
Leopold Magnus 01:37:09 Oh, sounds good. I'm sure they'll manage. And infinite because it's the gluttonous fork. It's like a once per day thing. Yeah. It's racked up so that
Cyrus Schwert 01:37:15 I'll still be there and alive for sure. There wasn't much left.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:28 Months. Yeah, it's an auto-feeder. Really, really the only concern is the poop. And, you know, as far as all the horrible things that can happen in D&D, that's pretty, that's not that bad. You know, it's like, oh, there's some poop. No. They'll manage. Yeah, yeah, I mean, come on.
Cletus Cobbington 01:37:33 Oh wow. That's true. And Cyrus just used a spider cum pillow so that's probably worse than the kennel now.
Kaladen Shash 01:37:33 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:37:43 It's been a couple of days. There's a few piles at this point.
Cyrus Schwert 01:37:55 You've never seen Hoarders. We don't have to talk about this, but I was tired. I can't sleep without a pillow. We've been over this. Well...
Cletus Cobbington 01:38:05 You were just so ready to use it. There was just no hesitation is all. That's what we're concerned about. But you didn't weigh any more options is all.
Leopold Magnus 01:38:07 I will say he did fall asleep almost instantly. I'm taking this back for the lab experiments.
Dungeon Master 01:38:12 is a wild one. I was tired.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:12 Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:38:19 Bye.
Cyrus Schwert 01:38:23 It was like fully molded to my head. It was like a Tempur-Pedic. I left my actual Tempur-Pedic pillow in your friggin' tree to keep sleeping there. What was the route? Shit. I didn't know it was going to cream up while I was sleeping. Oh yeah, it's stronghold.
Dungeon Master 01:38:37 It started as just fighter webbing. He didn't know it was going to turn into that. It's really stiff.
Leopold Magnus 01:38:43 Well, and it served as a really nice hair gel. I don't want to poke your hair. Is it stiff still? This stuff could really come in handy, you guys know.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:44 All the water... He's been...
Cletus Cobbington 01:38:51 Wait, did you save any of that? Use what's left and do that, like, 2000s really spiky hair on my whole body. I want to turn into, like, a hedgehog. All right, I'm suddenly on board with this stuff.
Cyrus Schwert 01:38:53 I mean, it's pretty cool, actually.
Kaladen Shash 01:38:54 ha ha ha
Leopold Magnus 01:39:13 Oh, I think you'd have to leave that up to the lead or satirist.
Dungeon Master 01:39:18 one makeover later.
Cletus Cobbington 01:39:22 No. It's all stringy. That's all. Okay. Alright, let's... Would we have an idea of where the transporter's circle would be? Would it be in Elerion? No.
Cyrus Schwert 01:39:25 we're like doing something very serious and we're like talking about my fucking cum pillow like can we get can we get on with it
Kaladen Shash 01:39:48 So he could be in this district. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:39:48 It would be there. Yeah, that was like the center of their political structure. So, like, transportation between the domes would come through there. At this point, yes. It is actively receding. But, like, the city is still flooded from, like...
Cletus Cobbington 01:40:01 Also question, we're still really underneath water, right? Right. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:40:12 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:40:18 The Vale with Mithalorn, Larendel, Silphane, and Calathiel were all flooded to begin with. You know that Alarion was above water. It's high enough in the dome, because it's built on like a cascading sort of wall, that when you were approaching the dome, you saw that a portion of the city was elevated. And knowing the map now, you know that that is that district.
Cletus Cobbington 01:40:34 Right. Right. I mean, but theory, I mean, this is like a room under ground, right?
Dungeon Master 01:40:46 So you can make your way there and eventually be out of the water. You just would have to sort of go through the water first. Or wait until it's gone. A little pocket of air in here.
Cletus Cobbington 01:41:05 i mean how did this just exist did they have to like travel down here somehow or was is there like i don't know a staircase that goes up to somewhere in the city
Dungeon Master 01:41:19 You would be able to ask your party members this. Kaladin, Azariel, and Leopold would be able to tell you that when they found the other sort of source of the arcane well, that it was like a long abandoned place. It was like being guarded by a dragon. There was like no people that really knew where it was. But the general population doesn't really worry about that anyway. They have all their sort of society-created problems.
Cletus Cobbington 01:41:38 Sure. So this is probably just . OK. I was just thinking . Right.
Dungeon Master 01:41:49 It would make sense. There is a maintenance tunnel that leads here, but probably wasn't well-traveled. Eventually, you could find your way out, but you'd probably get ejected at a different district from where you are level-wise. ...
Cletus Cobbington 01:42:09 Gotcha. OK. Well, what's our best course of action to get out? I mean, assumingly, we don't want to wait here till the water drains. Yeah. Yeah. That at least gets us above the water, whether it's necessarily where we . Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:17 Well... Yeah. Yeah, let's do it.
Kaladen Shash 01:42:23 Think out the service tunnel. See if we can keep moving forward. Just whatever this gets to. Yeah, and then we can make our way to the right district. Yeah, yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:42:24 200 years. Got it flooded.
Cletus Cobbington 01:42:40 OK. Use the service tunnel. Traverse through that. Well, that would at least get us further up into the wall, right?
Dungeon Master 01:42:44 So what's the plan exactly? The surface tunnel, if you went back far enough, would probably end up back in the water. There was just one way. Yeah. If you took the water back, you could go to the surface of the water and get out of the water in no time. That is something that you could do.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:57 Well, we were prepared to go through the water anyway. Do we want to do anything about the spiders? I mean, do we want to, like...
Kaladen Shash 01:43:10 I'll see that. Fighters. We can't.
Cletus Cobbington 01:43:12 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:43:16 But no long breath, just what I was saying.
Cyrus Schwert 01:43:24 both with spiders.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:26 light the web on fire or something as we go or like collapse this tunnel or something because the moment they said their plan was the moment the water was gone they were going to take over the city but we got her like eye thing she's dead
Kaladen Shash 01:43:39 Right, but we killed their... No, we didn't. Should we get boons from her? Oh, we killed her. I feel like that's going to end the nest eventually. Now they're disorganized. The problem's already solved. You could shoot some fire bolts down there, like start a fire in a coal mine, just let the webs burn forever.
Dungeon Master 01:43:46 No, you killed her. You killed the fuck out of her, yeah. No, they were very much being controlled by her.
Cletus Cobbington 01:43:48 Yeah. I mean, because then they're just spiders without a queen. Yeah. They weren't necessarily sentient, I don't think, right? She was the only... Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:59 Yeah, I guess. Yeah, okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah, I think. Yeah, yeah. Okay, alright. Gotcha, I was, okay. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 01:44:16 Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 01:44:18 We'll just call an exterminator before we teleport out. It'll be all right. How big is it? Like a baseball?
Dungeon Master 01:44:18 Speaking of which, Cyrus does have that eyeball. Hasn't talked about it a whole lot. A little bit bigger.
Cyrus Schwert 01:44:30 Yes. I do have an eyeball, I suppose. A grapefruit.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:30 oh um
Cletus Cobbington 01:44:48 Softball. The personal watermelons. Nice. So like, I'm kidding. You are what?
Dungeon Master 01:44:53 a small watermelon you know smaller than that like the ones that are like uh like still fit in your hand but it's a large old it's good
Cyrus Schwert 01:45:00 I pull it out of my back pocket. I was sitting on it. Shit. I look at it. It's an eyeball. I see you. I'm like behind a wall.
Cletus Cobbington 01:45:20 Investigate that shit.
Kaladen Shash 01:45:22 I can just identify. See what that tells us.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:28 Yeah, somebody should look and see what that does. You want to spend 10 minutes or whatever and fiddle with it? While you're doing that, Cletus, did you want that Embered Main? Because I'll take it out of my inventory.
Dungeon Master 01:45:45 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:45:49 I mean, yeah. If you feel like it's not going to be of use to you later. And if you do decide you want it back, I'll give it back. But I'll hold on to it for sure. Is it like a cape?
Cyrus Schwert 01:45:53 From men's warehouse.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:58 No, I think it'd be better for you. No, don't worry. Yeah, I'll take it off. I'll drape it over you now that I'm in robot form. It looks good on you. You're going to like the way you look.
Cletus Cobbington 01:46:18 Oh, it is a cape. Oh. That's sick. I put it on Chip, actually. No. It's a huge cloak. Well, Damon's squirrel.
Dungeon Master 01:46:20 It's like a half cloak. It rides your shoulder line, and when you activate it, it turns into a full cape. PJ's fire powers.
Kaladen Shash 01:46:21 Can I just identify on the eyeball, see if it's got any magical properties or
Cyrus Schwert 01:46:34 I appreciate it.
Zariel Torgan 01:46:37 Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:46:51 Yeah, it absolutely does. You guys took a long rest. I don't know if Travis wanted to attune to it because then he could just tell you, but if he wants to share, he can, or else he could just cherry pick what he wants to tell you.
Kaladen Shash 01:46:54 How do you use it? I can tell it requires attunement.
Cyrus Schwert 01:47:02 I would definitely do that. For sure.
Dungeon Master 01:47:24 Let's see if I can... Well, he had already short-rested when he was sleeping on the cum pillow.
Cletus Cobbington 01:47:26 Like resting now or like this was previously? Oh, gotcha. It's just canon.
Zariel Torgan 01:47:35 Not even dressing it up anymore. I like that Travis was like, the spiderwebs would be comfy. And so he's like, this would make a good pillow. And Jonathan's just like, no, it's cum. That was it, yeah. Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:47:39 Now the thing is, well, I called it wet and that's my first mistake. Sure.
Kaladen Shash 01:47:53 Yep.
Cletus Cobbington 01:47:57 All right, maybe we should take care of these.
Dungeon Master 01:47:58 And then it just spiraled from there. Wet white stuff? Are you kidding me? Jesus. It's so fertile in here.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:05 Yeah. I wonder this so many damn spiders. Yeah. Oh my God. It's pretty good.
Cyrus Schwert 01:48:16 Holy shit.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:18 Oh, my God. I think you've got spot in your hair, Cyrus. They're starting to hatch. There's a little egg here.
Cletus Cobbington 01:48:45 Nice. The armor is nice. I like the visual of like,
Dungeon Master 01:48:45 A lot of it's just description stuff. Fucking fools laughed at me.
Cyrus Schwert 01:48:47 That's why I carry around a baseball net. I've been made fun of so many times, guys.
Kaladen Shash 01:48:49 That's rad. It's really cool.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:50 We got some pretty sweet stuff on it. It's a good catch. Good find. Nice.
Cletus Cobbington 01:49:13 you don't put it on something. You still have to hold it and aim it where you're looking. That's pretty cool. Yeah. Mythic emergence, that's crazy.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:22 Like a periscope. Mm hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:49:24 You know the backstories underage
Dungeon Master 01:49:24 Should have sold those other two things that it did too. It just looks like the one thing is... That's just... Yeah. It's once. He's not permanently unkillable.
Cyrus Schwert 01:49:41 I'm going to have to read that. Yeah, that's wild.
Cletus Cobbington 01:49:44 Just the unkillable. Oh, it's like literally 100.
Dungeon Master 01:49:56 I should clarify that.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:56 I mean, the nullifying gaze... Yeah, I mean, there's some pretty great stuff in there. Plus two to AC, the nullifying gaze. I mean, just a blanket advantage against saves against any spell. I mean, those right there are enough to be pretty crazy.
Kaladen Shash 01:50:07 Yeah. That's fine. I like the nullify, I guess. Pretty sweet object.
Leopold Magnus 01:50:09 Jonathan, what are the odds that the...
Cletus Cobbington 01:50:18 Yeah.
Cyrus Schwert 01:50:23 Whoa. I guess I like spiders a little bit. Spider's kind of growing on me.
Dungeon Master 01:50:28 He says again. He's going to enter his goth era. That would be in theory possible, but you're asking about like
Leopold Magnus 01:50:41 that the nullifying gaze could be harnessed into a weapon to be more directed.
Kaladen Shash 01:50:49 It's pretty open. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:50:56 altering an artifact so powerful that you couldn't comprehend how to enchant it like that like anything in the relic category is like power imbued by higher beings like you have to be a level 20 character to kind of like handle that shit
Leopold Magnus 01:51:05 So maybe like if I gain more power, it'd be possible or literally never, no matter how powerful you are. I see. Got it.
Cletus Cobbington 01:51:10 Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 01:51:23 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:51:24 This is like a remnant of the cursed war given to her by some powerful dark being. But as you guys... Don't take the long rest, you guys.
Dungeon Master 01:51:52 Sort of wrap up here and you start heading back through the tunnels. Eventually, if you followed the way you came, you'd hit the water. You have your various ways to make it so that you can breathe. You make it to the surface pretty easy. As you guys come from the very bottom, it's incredibly dark down here, but your eyes have adjusted. You're sort of rising. And at the time, it does get very beautiful. You're like in this open space.
Cyrus Schwert 01:52:06 ... ... ... ... ...
Dungeon Master 01:52:14 aquarium type feel where like there's natural vegetation kind of drifting in the water that is slowly receding out and light filters in and kind of like sparkles past as you guys hit the surface you look up and there's still hundreds of feet until you hit the top of the dome that's overgrown with like ivy and stuff that kind of hangs and blows in the wind and you guys can swim towards the surface
Cyrus Schwert 01:52:36 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:52:40 of like some land there's a little bit of climbing involved um like the path that connects the districts of broken with time but eventually you sort of prop up all a little bit wet on the stone worked ground on like a path in the illyrian district of the alar trees
Cletus Cobbington 01:52:59 Oh, looks sick.
Kaladen Shash 01:53:00 Do we see any writing that might help us sort of
Leopold Magnus 01:53:08 Did Alar translate to ash? Right. Okay, got it.
Dungeon Master 01:53:12 Alar is like a generic elven tree type. It's like very Lord of the Rings. We'll do this one. Very cinematic.
Cletus Cobbington 01:53:27 Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:53:30 Help guide us towards a certain area to see a teleportation or a central office.
Dungeon Master 01:53:41 um we'll get everybody give me a perception or investigation check to look for that but then also one of you go ahead and give me a d 20 rule odds versus evens odds is bad evens is good
Cletus Cobbington 01:54:10 Who wants it?
Leopold Magnus 01:54:16 Oh, I don't know. I'm not feeling too lucky. You guys want to roll it? I think so. Hmm.
Kaladen Shash 01:54:21 The D20. Here it comes. There's odd.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:23 Yeah just odds are even. Which one do we want?
Dungeon Master 01:54:24 D20. Odd three even. Odd. All of your checks are very good. The last thing Cletus remembers before you guys kind of come back to later that night is you do see... Does Cletus read Elvin? Elvish? You see a sign that kind of points to...
Cyrus Schwert 01:54:46 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:54:48 Yeah. Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:54:53 like town center is the equivalent of what it like translate, like the community area of this district. And you feel like that's a pretty good start. And then almost as if time has been wiped from your brains, you guys are all kind of just sitting on the ground right where you were. The ground has long since dried your clothes completely dry. It is night outside. The wind kind of blows very coolly. You look to your side and the water has receded.
Cyrus Schwert 01:55:16 Wait.
Dungeon Master 01:55:22 Over 100 feet, it's been so much time. You have lost your entire day. Something. You're literally walking one second later. It is nighttime. You jumped time in an instant.
Cletus Cobbington 01:55:24 Interesting. Well, top red.
Leopold Magnus 01:55:29 Did we just get men in black? Is it like we're literally walking, one second we take a step, next second, boom?
Kaladen Shash 01:55:32 Yeah. I guess we're in or.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:55 Wasn't... Wasn't there something about the, like, climate control on the inside of the dome? It was, like, like, artificial, right? Because there's no, like, sun on the inside. Isn't that part of the magic of our dome?
Cletus Cobbington 01:55:55 I instantly set up the willow tree.
Dungeon Master 01:56:18 This dome is long since broken open. Remember, there's a huge crack in one side, and vegetation is, like, growing in. So it's just, like, a clear, opaque-ish, like, reinforced glass that you can enchant into, so it, like, upholds the barrier energy. You imagine New New Arbor is somewhat similar. But, yeah, you guys have just lost track of, like, six hours of time.
Kaladen Shash 01:56:21 It's cracked. Cracked egg. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:24 Oh, okay. Okay. Interesting.
Cyrus Schwert 01:56:41 Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 01:56:46 chip screams bloody murder Jonathan if you would
Leopold Magnus 01:56:51 I'm gonna play it cool. Oh, wait. Oh, that happened. You guys too. Okay. Yeah. That was pretty weird. I'm gonna just grab a little almond and stuff it in his mouth.
Kaladen Shash 01:56:53 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:55 I'm gonna freak the fuck out.
Cletus Cobbington 01:57:15 Oh.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:23 Do we get any other... Does anybody else picture the Ice Age squirrel when they think of Chip? Just...
Kaladen Shash 01:57:24 Now I do.
Dungeon Master 01:57:25 You hear like some glass break in the distance from Chip's scream, just like a very kind of echoes through the completely empty and energyless dark city. You guys feel very alone in this moment.
Cletus Cobbington 01:57:49 Yeah, I was going to say, no, yeah. Let's just say he doesn't also create complete natural disasters, though. He just, he just, this is true.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:52 Trying to get that nut, trying to get that almond. Yeah. I was going to say, he's not working his full potential. Did we get any vibe or any sort of anything for this happening? Or it just happens and now we're dealing with it?
Kaladen Shash 01:57:54 So driven, so driven. That's good. Yeah, look, look.
Leopold Magnus 01:57:55 Yeah. Maybe he could.
Dungeon Master 01:58:24 It's, it's really hard to say you, you guys were all looking at various things when you all blanked, but what you, if you talked about it would come to realize is that you lost your memory at the, what seems like the same moment. You all can kind of work back through it. You know, most person, most recent thing that was said was said by this person at this time. Okay. I remember that. Okay. And then I lost my memory. So like,
Cyrus Schwert 01:58:27 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:58:53 It affected you all at the same rate, ended at the same rate. But through talking with each other, you're not missing anything. You know that you guys don't know it. That is what you uncover. You have not missed information. You just lost that time. You guys sat in one spot without moving for six hours. You got a short rest for sure.
Zariel Torgan 01:59:06 Did we get a short rest? I say we don't move at all for another two hours and just make it a long rest. Yeah, I only need like six, I think.
Leopold Magnus 01:59:07 is yeah that's fine with me that's a good point i need less too
Kaladen Shash 01:59:09 Just give up. I've already meditated. I've meditated for four hours. I'm good. I made it. Long rest. So do we want to try to go...
Cletus Cobbington 01:59:22 I mean, it's nice.
Cyrus Schwert 01:59:23 For what?
Kaladen Shash 01:59:36 Yeah, I mean, we can long rest. That way we feel like we can move forward towards the teleportation circle. I would like that.
Leopold Magnus 01:59:43 I was wondering, is there any evidence around us, like tracks or anything like that, just completely clear? All right. Could have been better.
Zariel Torgan 01:59:44 How far are we? Yeah, can I look around and see if there's anything that doesn't match up with what I was looking at, or do we already do that?
Dungeon Master 01:59:44 If it doesn't matter to you guys, it is now the middle of the night, but if you just want to go with the offset sleep schedule, you could just change shifts. Give me an investigation check. Give me also an investigation check.
Kaladen Shash 02:00:11 Yep, could have been better. A1. Wow, man, we lost six hours. That's all we know.
Leopold Magnus 02:00:13 Oh yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:00:21 7 yeah might have been 5 might have been 7 with that roll
Dungeon Master 02:00:27 Um, yeah, the area that you're in is, it is like overgrown in nature, like taken over by nature, but the ground is still worked stone and like beautiful little pathways. So it's not like dirt. You don't, you don't, you can't like trap on it and nobody rolled high enough to sort of see anything on top of that. So you, you just lost the time.
Cyrus Schwert 02:00:49 Bye.
Kaladen Shash 02:00:51 We're in the correct district. It couldn't be too much of a time to get there. We see signs that say city center. We can assume that that
Leopold Magnus 02:00:56 Well, chalk it up to being an adventure. Should we get going or just call this a long rest?
Zariel Torgan 02:00:58 How far are we from the teleportation circle? Pretty close, right?
Cletus Cobbington 02:01:02 Oh.
Kaladen Shash 02:01:22 be a likely place to house the circle. I mean, my resources and health are pretty good. I've just lost two level two spell slots right now. Yeah, because our can't recover just once per day or long rest.
Zariel Torgan 02:01:25 What do you guys say? Do you think we should just push for it, or do you want to just do it tomorrow? Yeah, I'm down, like... Alright, I'm okay to push.
Leopold Magnus 02:01:35 Yeah. I'm full health, and I've only used a second-level spell, so...
Cletus Cobbington 02:01:43 my contribution is i'm out of my max level spells so in the event we need some real damage or some real help i can only do two more fourth level but i'm out of my fifth levels but you know that's also like if we want to be if
Kaladen Shash 02:01:53 Yeah, so maybe couldn't do it. Yeah, let's go ahead and just finish the rest. And we'll just be on an offset schedule as we move forward. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:01:53 I did catch her. Thank you.
Cletus Cobbington 02:02:10 Yeah, if we want to be fully prepared for when we go through the teleporter for worst case scenario, yeah. That's the only thing I'm thinking about. OK. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:02:26 All right.
Kaladen Shash 02:02:27 Let's all get recharged and then we'll move forward towards the circle. I mean, we just need two more hours. We can push forward. Unless you guys need to tinker or take care of things.
Dungeon Master 02:02:28 I'll rule it like that because it makes sense that you guys would get benefits.
Leopold Magnus 02:02:33 So we're going to finish the rest and are we going to wait until morning or are we just going to keep going? Like in two hours, basically. Yeah. Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 02:02:42 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:02:49 on it but how i'll do it is is you guys will get the benefits of a long rest hp spells abilities but because you guys didn't physically sleep and you have not slept for a full day if you do anything strenuous in the next day or span of night you still risk on taking points of exhaustion because your bodies are still tired because you have not like actually slept you were standing
Kaladen Shash 02:03:15 Okay. Yeah, I mean, there's no harm in that. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:03:18 or doing something that you don't remember for six hours. You aren't like laying down sleeping.
Cletus Cobbington 02:03:22 I mean, it doesn't hurt to just start with a new day. Oh, look, he's actually thinking about his dogs. He's a changed man.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:26 Well, since it's night, do we want to just bite the bullet, sleep like we would normally, just earlier than we expected, and then just get up in the morning? Yeah. I mean, those dogs are going to be fine.
Cyrus Schwert 02:03:43 The first time you've mentioned them.
Leopold Magnus 02:03:44 I guess if we're doing that, I'll take the risk of exhaustion and tinker all night while you guys sleep.
Dungeon Master 02:03:59 Love it. Somebody taking on exhaustion. Okay. Everybody goes to sort of, we'll finish up with this. So let's be like the last thing. Everybody gets ready to bed down for the night. Leopold, what do you want to work on? Yeah. Now memory serves that you passed half of the checks.
Cletus Cobbington 02:04:03 Um,
Leopold Magnus 02:04:11 I was hoping to roll a few more times on the bone crusher armor upgrade. See if I could maybe put some good work into that.
Cyrus Schwert 02:04:19 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:04:29 And it's just the time commitment now? Well, it's the remaining checks and the time commitment, right? Because you had switched, but it was still a relatively low-level spell that you were switching to. Because you were working on just improving his armor, and then you switched to working on the dragon hide.
Leopold Magnus 02:04:36 Yeah, I mean, to be honest, I'd have to look it up. But I do know I made some efforts towards it, so. What, switched for? Oh, yeah. Yeah, and I got the Dragonhide inclusion done. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:04:37 you
Dungeon Master 02:04:58 Yeah, inclusion. So it's like your time had reset. So you have passed two of your four checks, which are DC 14. But I don't know how much of your 32 hours you had knocked out. We'll say, yeah, like maybe eight hours total is gone. So you've got 20 something, 24.
Leopold Magnus 02:05:12 Okay. Yeah. I can't remember to be honest. I think maybe worked on it like one night or two nights. Okay. So I'll make an arcana check for that. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:05:32 Yeah, if you spend enough time on it, you can make the remaining checks. And then it's just time and money that you have to put into it after that. So go ahead and give me two Arcana checks. 24 is success. 17 is success. Yeah. Succeed on both? How many hours? I'll write it down. It's time.
Cyrus Schwert 02:05:33 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:05:43 Uh, so 24, uh, 17, he says DC 14. Okay. Um, and then yeah, I'll put, I'll, I'll just, I'll just put the whole time while everyone's asleep instead of sleeping. I'll just work on that.
Dungeon Master 02:06:03 Okay. We'll say six more hours of rest because everybody didn't get tired throughout the day, but you put six more hours, you're down to 18 hours left on that. Okay.
Cyrus Schwert 02:06:03 It's
Leopold Magnus 02:06:15 Cool.
Dungeon Master 02:06:26 While you're working on this and everybody is sleeping, you are just tinkering away at his armor construction. You're working into the nuts and bolts, preloading some runes and some areas to spot weld it into, whatever the artificial equivalent of that is. And at the periphery of your vision, you almost see a whispering, floating, sort of shadowy figure to your side.
Cyrus Schwert 02:06:37 Hey. Hey.
Leopold Magnus 02:06:58 I mean, can I make a perception check to see if I can clock it a little better? Oh, okay. Yeah, I'll kind of be startled and I'll say, show yourself! And I'll maybe grab a little lantern that I was focusing on Bonecrusher's armor and point it.
Dungeon Master 02:07:04 Yeah. In fact, when you look up no check needed, it doesn't go away. You sort of just fix your gaze and you're looking at like a sort of shadowy, wispy version of bone pressure.
Cletus Cobbington 02:07:24 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:07:28 towards the shadow. Very interesting. OK. And so it's kind of ethereal, wispy, like hardly even takes a shape, or is it pretty clearly
Dungeon Master 02:07:31 And you see, like, it looks like this essence that's manifested to look like bone pressure. And looking at it, it feels very connected to you somehow. Pretty clearly looks like bone pressure.
Cyrus Schwert 02:07:49 Okay. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:07:56 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:08:00 There, yeah. OK. Interesting. I'm going to do a check on it, maybe kind of like, is it pulling more towards me or towards Bone Crusher? Interesting.
Dungeon Master 02:08:04 just diffused like a ghost. Towards you.
Leopold Magnus 02:08:23 I'll kind of walk up, look at it closely, maybe try to kind of figure out what it's made out of. And then I'll take a step back and I'll say, Neil.
Cyrus Schwert 02:08:33 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:08:38 you sort of like take a closer look at it and it's i mean it looks material and immaterial it is like manifestation of spell energy kind of deal it it's nothing you've seen before but um recently in the last like couple days or even a week or so you've had like
Dungeon Master 02:09:00 similar sort of whispering energy kind of to you so that's how you knew it was kind of a part of you and when you say kneel it very much kneels down thank you
Leopold Magnus 02:09:13 Oh, very interesting. Hmm. Well, arise and walk over there and await my command. And I'll just turn back to tinkering on Bonecrusher's armor.
Dungeon Master 02:09:29 obeys your command. And you finish out your night working on Bone Crusher. Nothing else eventful happens other than until you dismiss it, it absolutely remains there.
Cyrus Schwert 02:09:42 Okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:09:46 interesting very interesting you
Cletus Cobbington 02:09:51 Can you attune to things while sleeping? OK. I put on a comfy, nice, warm cloak. I forgot the word. Mane.
Dungeon Master 02:10:01 And you guys, yes, you can. Cloak works 100%. You attuned to your thing. Yes.
Leopold Magnus 02:10:17 I was going to say, the other thing I do at the very end of the day is I kind of pull out of my toolbox a cloak. And I will put it on. And it's one of my infusions. And I'm going to create the cloak of Elvenkind.
Cyrus Schwert 02:10:28 Okay.
Cletus Cobbington 02:10:32 Go.
Dungeon Master 02:10:40 The Click of the Manta Ray? Oh, Click of the Manta Ray. Nice. You get this all done. Love that. You do with as much as you did that night, unfortunately, you do take a point of exhaustion for the next day. But that was a very productive night.
Leopold Magnus 02:10:42 of elven kind. So no longer will I have disadvantage on stealth check, because I'll have advantage shot flat. All right.
Kaladen Shash 02:10:48 Delphine. Great night.
Dungeon Master 02:11:11 All right, guys, I think we just all good for that. Oh, what is just just a half movement, maybe?
Leopold Magnus 02:11:11 Yeah, it was a lot of fun. Just so I'm aware, what is the point of exhaustion? Like I've added it, but what does that do to me? Reduce my speed.
Cletus Cobbington 02:11:17 Yep.
Cyrus Schwert 02:11:17 Nice set. That was fun. Does that heat too? Does that heat?
Kaladen Shash 02:11:20 Disadvantage on checks, isn't that it? Oh, no, no, no. It's not even that. It's just checks, not saves. Oh, what's the first level? What is it?
Zariel Torgan 02:11:42 No, half movements too. Yeah, it's just ability checks. So, yeah, combat, it really doesn't make a big difference. It's more like, you know, character stuff. Yeah, like, you have to talk to a guard, you have to, like, fiddle with something, you know, all that stuff.
Leopold Magnus 02:11:42 It says when you make a D 20 test, the role is reduced by two times your exhaustion level. And that would be disadvantage. Uh,
Dungeon Master 02:11:47 It's an ability check have disadvantage at this point. All ability checks. So your work. Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:11:50 Yes, it just checks. Just checks with first, yeah. Intelligence check. Oh, I'm tired. Disadvantage. Give me a stealth check. Give me an acrobatics check. Disadvantage.
Zariel Torgan 02:12:14 Yeah, all that shit. I didn't know that.
Leopold Magnus 02:12:14 right uh so they would all have disadvantage i see yeah um okay it looks like they also changed it a little bit too like since there's a legacy definition okay but
Dungeon Master 02:12:19 Yep, until you get a long rest or somebody removes that condition from you. So I missed that at the very end. What was that?
Kaladen Shash 02:12:31 Oh, it might be an updated version of exhaustion. I didn't think about that.
Leopold Magnus 02:12:45 Yeah, I think they may have updated it, but I was reading it says that you have your reduced speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to five times your exhaustion level. And then when you make a D20 test, the rule is reduced by two times your exhaustion level. Just have disadvantage flat across the board, yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:13:06 We're going to go with the original rules. Yep. Since most of what we do is original rules, we're going to do that. Second level exhaustion is half movement. Third is saving throws. Fourth is...
Kaladen Shash 02:13:06 They've updated exhaustion. Wow. It builds with every level. Yeah. I like that. Saving throws? What's third? Saving throws? Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:08 I think it's everything.
Leopold Magnus 02:13:18 Nice. So then what would second level exhaustion be? How would that add up?
Dungeon Master 02:13:34 your HP is reduced or something like that. Yeah, I think maybe, I don't know, fifth, you'd lose your sight or some shit like that, and if you get six levels of exhaustion in the old rules, you're just dead.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:37 It's like slow too, like you can't do more than one thing and you can't... It's fucking crazy. You just die.
Kaladen Shash 02:13:41 Yeah. Dead. Let's go.
Leopold Magnus 02:13:51 Yeah, that's also true here. It says you die. Basically, the only difference here is instead of all those conditions, you just take two times the level of exhaust. So if you're five in, you have a negative 10 to all your DC rolls, DC 20s. So cool. Yeah.
Cletus Cobbington 02:14:15 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:14:17 All right, so next link.
Dungeon Master 02:14:17 I'll be able to play next week. Next week will probably be pretty eventful because assuming you guys get the teleportation stuff active, then you're back in New New Harbor or around the area. But the week after that, I'll be on vacation, so I'll be able to play the week of the 14th.
Kaladen Shash 02:14:19 Alright, yeah, that was great. Yeah. That's OK. OK.
Leopold Magnus 02:14:23 Yeah, thanks for the games. Nice. That'll work. Where are you headed?
Cyrus Schwert 02:14:24 That was super fun.
Cletus Cobbington 02:14:46 Okay. Wow.
Dungeon Master 02:14:51 Palm Springs.
Leopold Magnus 02:14:52 oh hell yeah do some golfing
Zariel Torgan 02:14:53 Nice.
Kaladen Shash 02:14:53 Wow.

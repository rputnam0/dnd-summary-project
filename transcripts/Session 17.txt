Dungeon Master 00:00:00 You had an instant, this dude fucks, had an instant reaction where you could see like the black ichor going up sort of your vein system, sort of turning all of your veins black and purple. And in a very split decision, very quick decision, you used light splitter to cut your arm off as high as you possibly could and waited a second
Zariel Torgan 00:00:03 We have finished.
Kaladen Shash 00:00:10 Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:00:26 to see if you stopped it, and once you didn't see anything advancing up, you took your potion of the soul wood prosthesis potion that you were attuned to, thankfully, and you have now seen this tiny little green sapling-like vine bursting out of the center of the nub that was cauterized by Leopold.
Kaladen Shash 00:00:52 That's great. It's a single use code. OK.
Dungeon Master 00:00:55 And you can, yeah, you can unattune that because its effect has taken effect. And then Rex, I added your sword and feel free to give me a different name if you want to.
Leopold Magnus 00:01:13 Oh. Oh, yeah, that's pretty sick. Nice, I don't have to think back to how much it does every turn. Jonathan, what was this cave like?
Dungeon Master 00:01:26 Yes, it's there now.
Dungeon Master 00:01:47 If you remember outside of where you currently are, is on even on the map that you see this large open space that had that sort of walkway, the large thin path that was like 60 foot elevated, there's like a crescent shape.
Dungeon Master 00:02:05 around the room. And originally there had been that bridge that collapsed. So it was a big opening now. And so the exit of the cavern is all the way up here. And in between there are, you know, an innumerable amount of like lycanthrope creatures.
Leopold Magnus 00:02:25 Okay. And presumably another large creature like we just felt.
Dungeon Master 00:02:43 You didn't see anything quite this big, but then there's also a big thing. You guys, when examining the dead werewolf before, it sort of shrunk down to a smaller, just wolf in form. It, while very similar to the one that you had seen way back when in the Market District attack, but it wasn't the same. So in your heads, you'd been like, oh, this is just a, like the other one is still a problem. This is not it.
Zariel Torgan 00:02:43 things.
Zariel Torgan 00:03:14 All right, I can become a giant badger that has a 10-foot burrow speed. I guess it'd be up to you, Jonathan. If I look at the wall, is it stone, or is it a type of really compact clay dirt? Or what do I see when I examine the wall?
Dungeon Master 00:03:39 You could absolutely burrow through this. It's like a very, it's like a compact dirt. This is deep in the ground, but it's like not so, sorry, it's not that deep into the ground. Because if you remember for most of the cave that you're in, you could hear the music of the tavern. So it's not like deep, solid stone.
Kaladen Shash 00:03:43 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:03:57 Mmm, gotcha. Can I? Can I like just put put my ear or my ear hole to the side of the cavern and try to just listen for like a general direction?
Dungeon Master 00:04:17 What are you listening for?
Zariel Torgan 00:04:20 I want to try to listen for either hollow sounds to meet up with a different tube that's nearby, or listen for the sounds of the bar. If I can tell a rough idea of either of those, then I can start burrowing in a direction. That way I'm not having to go 200 feet and just burst out under a street or something.
Dungeon Master 00:04:46 You know that it's sort of odd for it to be where it's at because of how developed everything is. So you feel like you don't have a ton of play in any direction, but it would make total sense that you could one either go up and over the cavern space that you were in or down and below and just meet up with that tunnel. Like pretty early on if you want it that you had used to get here in the first place.
Zariel Torgan 00:04:52 Mm-hmm. Could I make a check to, like, would it be, like, survival to get my bearings to just start burrowing to see how accurate I can hit to land in that spot?
Dungeon Master 00:05:22 Honestly, you don't even really need to make a check because you collapse this can this little mouth in this cavern with like your explosion. So there's collapsed rubble. And you know, that is the direction you came from. So you're like, okay, straight shot that way. I can get to it. So you just like go down or up first and then take a 90 degree turn, you know, like it doesn't seem very hard from where you're at. That's a it's a really good move to turn into a burrowing creature because you don't have to, you don't have to fuck around.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:30 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:53 Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I'll just turn to everybody and say, well, what do you guys think? I think I can burrow us out of here, unless you guys have some other thoughts. I'll say, well, all righty. And then I'll have that kind of iridescent light kind of glow, and I'll kind of like anamorph
Kaladen Shash 00:06:05 No, dig a tunnel.
Leopold Magnus 00:06:07 Yes, of course.
Zariel Torgan 00:06:23 But it's, I guess, more machine now. Just kind of like clicking apart like a transformer into a smaller little mole. But I'm still on two feet. And so I'm a giant metal badger with a little hat. Because that stays with me. Yeah, with a little headlamp.
Dungeon Master 00:06:30 It doesn't have to be like a Transformer if you don't want it to be. You seem reluctant.
Kaladen Shash 00:06:35 I used to have a mining hat with a little headlamp. I love that everything's metal. I love this. Yeah, it's just metal. It's metal.
Zariel Torgan 00:06:56 Yeah, it's a metallic badger. And I make badger noises, which I don't know what they are. And then I'll say, beep, beep, and I'll start burrowing. It's only a medium-sized tunnel, because I'm a medium creature, even though I'm a giant badger. So it's going to be pretty damn tight, but everybody should be able to fit.
Kaladen Shash 00:07:10 Crouching through, crawling, crawling, whatever we need to.
Dungeon Master 00:07:18 Yeah. Like, it'll be a slouched walk, you know, bent over, not to hit your head. Well, as Zariel is doing this, it's not, like, incredibly slow, but it's not, like, super fast. You guys have a chance to sort of just walk behind him and chat if you'd like to. Otherwise, we'll just speed it up right ahead.
Kaladen Shash 00:07:47 Side note, do you have music going? We're talking about sounds. I think it's going to take more than a minute.
Dungeon Master 00:07:52 Oh, I didn't share the link. How dare I? All right, keep going. I will do that right now. Yeah, I mean, it's been, it's like 90 seconds or something.
Leopold Magnus 00:07:55 Good catch. How's Caledon's arm coming along? Still just a little twig. OK, I guess it's
Zariel Torgan 00:08:12 Yeah, didn't the potion say
Kaladen Shash 00:08:18 Is it visibly growing in that 90 seconds or is it just kind of there? We just have presence. Yeah, OK, let's all figure it out. Yeah. Yes, look. Looks good.
Dungeon Master 00:08:23 From the initial point, yes. I think it's been it's been such a short amount of time that you don't think it's going to be like maybe even an overnight thing like this might take a little bit.
Zariel Torgan 00:08:42 that you had to like roll for it or something or how did that work? Gotcha. Okay. All right, sweet. I just hooked up the music. Nice.
Kaladen Shash 00:08:46 No, the potion just worked automatically. I just needed to have one limb missing and be attuned to it.
Zariel Torgan 00:09:04 All right, well yeah, I'm good to just keep cooking along. Although I guess we could chat with our mental stuff if you guys wanted to talk about plans. Ooh, did we want to put it, did we,
Kaladen Shash 00:09:16 A couple of thoughts. Did we learn anything? Was there any point in investigating the body? Do we discern the source of this? Do you know what I mean? Do we do any investigation stuff? Some sort of proof?
Zariel Torgan 00:09:36 Yeah, did we want to throw the smaller Wolfenform in the workshop so we have it? Is it too late to say we tossed it in there, Jonathan? OK. Yeah. It's just dead things.
Leopold Magnus 00:09:46 It's probably a good idea to do a little experimenting on that. I mean, we're going to... Don't go into the workshop.
Dungeon Master 00:09:57 No, you can do that. You walk back to go grab the body and you see that the two remaining little pups are sort of pressing on the dead form, making some whimpering sounds. They see you walking up and they sort of cower a little bit.
Kaladen Shash 00:09:59 It's our little shop of horrors, man. Dead bodies piling up in there. Jonathan, so these are actual just
Kaladen Shash 00:10:25 wolf pups? Like are these werewolf pups? Like what do we? Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:10:27 They look, not really. So like this form that you see, the mother you assume at this point, when they died didn't shrink to a person. It was very distinct that this turned from a big wolf into just a smaller wolf. And
Dungeon Master 00:10:48 So these woven pups that you see in front of you, I say woven because I'm not, you don't know what it is, it is like a very large form of a wolf. It's like, so these, even though these are pups, think of like, you know, medium sized dog at this point, right?
Kaladen Shash 00:11:01 The dire wolf pup. We've already killed two of them. What's two more?
Leopold Magnus 00:11:05 Are they going to? I was going to say, are they going to grow up to be kind of like their mom or we expect him to stay that way?
Zariel Torgan 00:11:06 Could we, oh, go ahead. Can I, I don't know, this is all a little loosey goosey. I kind of forgot, even though you did mention that they were still there, I did immediately forget.
Dungeon Master 00:11:20 Goddamn.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:34 Could I just suss out whether or not they have a level of intelligence or whether or not they're just feral? Would that be an animal handling or nature? What kind of check would you want to suss that out? My nature's really, really bad. Could I do animal handling? I can do nature. My nature's terrible.
Dungeon Master 00:11:53 Negative. Why would your nature be terrible? You're a druid. Okay. That's really dumb. Use it as a wisdom check instead. That's the worst thing I've ever heard.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:06 It's intelligence based. Isn't that just dumb? Yeah, I pitched nature before I read it and I was disappointed. So I got a 19 plus one for 20. Do you want me to just put what would have been for a wisdom based check? So it would have been 22. Or 23.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:06 Yeah, that's funny. That's true. My nature is one of my higher stats.
Kaladen Shash 00:12:08 Nature's intelligence? It's not wisdom? Wow. How funny. I would have never guessed that.
Dungeon Master 00:12:30 Wisdom, yeah. Nice. And what were you looking for again?
Zariel Torgan 00:12:48 Oh, I want to see so I'll tell you what I'm going to try to do with this information. I want to see if I can keep one or two as like a pet. But I don't if they're like intelligent. And they just saw us kill their mom. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:13:04 Oh, it was intelligent. That's right. No, I forgot what you we were discussing what to add. I forgot that it was supposed to be their intelligence. Yeah, go ahead. And so 22 is really good. They seem
Kaladen Shash 00:13:22 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:13:24 I mean, at this age, probably just the average intelligence of a dog. But again, the other one seemed intelligent in a combat perspective. It was very methodical.
Dungeon Master 00:13:39 You know that like if this is lycanthropy, which is like really how it presented, especially with Kaladin getting infected right away. You know, it's like a curse as well. So there's magical manipulation in that in itself. So it would be like not out of reason for you to be like, yeah, okay, that they're probably going to be like, they'd have good intelligence, you could probably train them.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:09 Um, yeah, can I? Yeah, um, I don't know. What do you guys think? Is this just stupid? Should we just kill him? I was thinking that a giant wolf dog might be kind of a cool sidekick.
Dungeon Master 00:14:10 unless you don't want them to be inspired. That's a good check in that I think you can get more of what you want in that situation. Not necessarily, but yeah, they're probably just cursed.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:28 Yeah, man, you can bring it along. Are they infected, Jonathan? Is that what he got out of that? Are these dogs that are going to turn into people? Not people that turn into werewolves.
Kaladen Shash 00:14:35 They're cursed. Dogs that might turn into werewolves. Wolves that turn into werewolves.
Dungeon Master 00:14:44 No, not in people. I think it's pretty obvious.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:49 Oh, if a wolf gets bit by a werewolf, it just turns into an angry dude. Oh, that's fantastic.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:58 Let's see. Can I do a nature check on there the curse like what might what it might be or is it pretty obvious? It's just lycanthropy and there's that's just Okay, so there's nothing like underneath that no no way to cure it as it's already progressed too far Okay
Kaladen Shash 00:15:08 That's it.
Dungeon Master 00:15:15 There's ways to cure it. There's like very high level magic that does exist that can do that, but it's not easily in access to people. You could, but that would be where you need to be at a place where you could have access to that.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:26 Uh, how about this? Could I maybe like look through a tome and do an arcana check into maybe get a just a clue as to what would need to be done to cure them of their, uh, their curse. I see. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:15:43 So it would be like leave them here and come back or take them with you either way with like the intent of looking at it later.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:54 Oh, well, I'm not sure. Do you think they would run amok with their curse and all?
Zariel Torgan 00:16:03 Well, you know, it just depends on how well we train them. I mean, I imagine that cursed or not, they could probably be trained like any other animal. I don't know. It's worth a shot. Worst case scenario, we bring them back as more evidence and do something with them. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 00:16:24 Sweet House Pits, no. Dead puppies, yes, the dead puppies.
Leopold Magnus 00:16:30 Well, I suppose I agree with you, Zario. It's a little bit, well, cruel to just off them like they're brothers. Point over to the other two dead ones. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:38 vicious squashed ones that were squished against the wall. Yeah. Oh no. All right. Can I like pull out some ration or try to do something out of like my bag and just try to like make, what, what kind of check would you like for me to try to get these in? Okay. All right. Uh, I'm going to guide myself. Does anybody want to help me with this? Cause it's not a great check.
Dungeon Master 00:16:59 That would be an animal handling.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:08 Yeah, I can. What is it, animal handling? So you're making a sling?
Kaladen Shash 00:17:11 Let me see if I've got any sort of bonus. What's my score? Oh, plus two. It's not much. Yes, I do.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:11 Yeah, yeah, how do you... Mine's a plus four, that's not terrible. Yeah, how are you gonna help me, Leo? No, I just wanted some rations, just like feed them a little, because animals are very food motivated.
Dungeon Master 00:17:35 Absolutely. Yeah, I love that.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:40 Oh, oh, I got this. I will cough up a rotisserie chicken. Yeah, yeah, because I've been carrying one around since I went to Sunseeker's grocery store.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:45 Yeah. Yeah. Like you do. Like you do. OK. All right. Yeah. So can I get, would I get advantage on that then? All right. And then I'm going to add a plus four to this. Oh, that's a natural 20.
Kaladen Shash 00:17:45 Still have another one in there. Of course, of course. Just, just wait. Yep. Yep. Like you do. Yeah. Yes! And what would you like to name them?
Leopold Magnus 00:18:10 Nice attitude. That's it. That's a perfect. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:18:11 All right. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but Zariel is also cursed with lycanthropy at this point, correct?
Zariel Torgan 00:18:14 Plus a two. Yeah, so that's a 26 total for a natural 20 to try to like coax these dogs to trust me and, you know, be my little pets. Correct.
Kaladen Shash 00:18:16 Oh, yes.
Dungeon Master 00:18:38 I think with the food rations and sort of just, even though you're fully metallic, you have this very nature-based essence, like it just radiates from your body, which gives you this connection to nature, unlike anybody else in the party, obviously. And I think with that, and then having the lycanthropy on top of that,
Dungeon Master 00:19:06 You sort of reach out with this food and you sort of will yourself to have like the right hormones and pheromones to sort of be perceived as friendly to these creatures. And not like just jump into your arms trusting, but you see like they without any reluctance sort of tamper towards you away from the body of the mother before you pick it up.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:16 All right. I'll just spend a little time kind of like caressing them and licking them. Well, not as, I guess, I was thinking I was a badger. I probably am not a badger yet.
Kaladen Shash 00:19:32 Perfect.
Zariel Torgan 00:19:45 Um, I'll, uh, I'll, uh, get everything loaded up. Yeah, I'll, I'll get everything loaded up. Um, can I keep them in the box or do we determine that anything alive in there would make it to where you couldn't move it?
Dungeon Master 00:19:46 Not yet. This is retconning, remember? Yeah, I think. No, I mean, you could technically be in it, but it's got limited air. It's very much like a bag of holding.
Zariel Torgan 00:20:14 Okay. All right. Well then, since we're just getting out of here, I'll just, uh, set the rest of the food that I have in a little pile and fluff up like maybe a little, like a, a blanket down there and, you know, pet them and show them that that's their little spot and, you know, maybe put down a little mat for them to pee on. And, uh, and then I'll close it up and then get us out of here.
Kaladen Shash 00:20:15 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:20:44 All right, and then we get back to current time with you guys burrowing. OK, you guys haven't tested it yet.
Zariel Torgan 00:20:51 Yeah, I'm just cooking right along. Yeah, I'm just seeing where I can get us.
Kaladen Shash 00:20:59 Yes, 10 feet at a time, just crawling.
Dungeon Master 00:21:15 But go ahead, and then I think maybe Kaladin would be best for this. Maybe even Leopold. Give me an arcana or intelligence check. Because you know that the workshop has oxygen in it when it's open, but you don't know how much you have enclosed. So yeah, go ahead and give me a check just to see if you could figure out how much time you would need in between each opening of the toolbox.
Kaladen Shash 00:21:30 And we can guess. It's so cocked, it's really between a two and a 20. I got a nine. Yeah, it was right there. You should chime in if you want.
Dungeon Master 00:21:47 It killed us, yeah, too. Sucks. Yeah, because this could have been a specific action. 28.
Leopold Magnus 00:21:51 So could I make a check as well, or is it just one of the other? Yeah, I'll take a look. Oh, that's not too bad. Let's see. Yeah, not too bad, 26.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:59 Is this a guidance thing? Yeah, so add a four to that or add a D4. I mean not not just for. Nice 26 knife.
Kaladen Shash 00:22:11 He cleared the bar, cleared the bar. I'm 6.
Dungeon Master 00:22:18 Leopold gets this random blip of information pulled into his like center brain that like Barry logistically lays out that a bag of holding classically has 10 divided by however many creatures worth of minutes of breathable air in it as like an enchantment so it's always the exact same you can't like put more in there which is part of the enchantment does that to it
Dungeon Master 00:22:47 So with two little werewolf pups, you know there is five minutes of air every time.
Kaladen Shash 00:22:58 OK. Yeah. No, you've got plenty of time. Yeah, you can. Yeah. You bite broke for two minutes. How big was that main chamber?
Leopold Magnus 00:22:59 Well, Zariel, I reckon you don't make them too comfortable. They're only having five minutes of air down there.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:08 So yeah, I think I was going to just have them in there while I'm burrowing. So if I get 10 feet per round, that's a hundred feet per minute. So it should be like how long? Yeah. That was kind of my thought. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So do we,
Dungeon Master 00:23:27 Yeah, two minutes would be plenty. I just wanted to put the information out there that you guys needed to know that information. You just suffocated them.
Kaladen Shash 00:23:29 OK. Cool. Let's do it. Good puppies. It's. No one checked on them. I thought you opened it.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:39 Mm, gotcha. Yeah, it is relevant. It is very relevant. Yeah. Can you imagine all that work to get that natural 20 to get them and then I open it up and they're just fucking dead? Yeah. Yeah, they're just like, why have you forsaken me? Oh, yeah. Well, it's good. It's good looking out. I mean, it's good to know.
Leopold Magnus 00:23:54 This ran out of air.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:09 Where do we pop up at?
Dungeon Master 00:24:09 Right. You pop up in wherever you want in this previous room that you had been in. Let me load it up first. But anyway, it was that long tunnel network that you had gone.
Dungeon Master 00:24:35 sort of the bottom left of it once it loads up. It's going to make sure it's right. But you can retrace your steps. And I'll say badgers, I'm pretty sure, have blind sight or tremor sense to a certain extent. So you can map out the ground as you're moving forward.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:53 Mm-hmm Yeah, I think what do you guys think do you want to pop up like maybe So we can go back through that back room and maybe check out some of those games or do you guys just want to get back to Get back to the hub Oh shit, you're right. Yeah. No, you're absolutely right
Leopold Magnus 00:25:14 Hmm. Well. Yeah. Well, maybe we go to the spit and swallow him.
Kaladen Shash 00:25:17 I have no money. No money. Nothing. I mean, I look.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:24 We need to get paid. It's true. Well, once we... Yeah, no, you're right. Let's...
Dungeon Master 00:25:28 You guys found 125 or 150 gold or whatever it was on those bodies in that room?
Kaladen Shash 00:25:46 I have no arm, I'm pretty beat up, you know. Now we just get back.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:52 Let's just hoof it as fast as we can, get back and maybe get ourselves paid or get one of those tokens. That way if we get anything cool we can do that while we're leveling up for our long rest. Unless there's something you guys want to do before we get back. I'm good with just getting back.
Leopold Magnus 00:26:14 I guess before we take a long rest, I'd take a look at the library. If we have time.
Dungeon Master 00:26:21 Yeah, so you guys, you hoof it out, so you go through the cave system to, hold on, I made a map of it, I want you guys to see it, through the tavern, sort of straight line it all the way to the street, out the street to the nearest teleportation circle, back to the center rooms, and then to the library.
Dungeon Master 00:26:51 Is that the chain again? Mine's not loading great. What the fuck's going on? Yeah, afternoon nip and evening sip.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:52 We got to come back here. That's a cool map. We'll come back here eventually. Nice.
Kaladen Shash 00:27:03 It's a party, everybody's there. There's a stage. This is the actual tavern.
Leopold Magnus 00:27:04 Oh, nice. Oh, this is the tower, isn't it?
Dungeon Master 00:27:25 Okay well then let me get you back there.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:26 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:27:36 And then we'll sort of break up and do whatever you need to do. Before the end of the night. So you get back to your center room. I assume you go to. Your CEO and let them know that you finished. Or do you want to rest and do it in the morning? It is at this point very late. If you remember you had set out on this. And then.
Kaladen Shash 00:27:54 Yep. Yeah, just go to rest.
Dungeon Master 00:28:06 Like once you set out, it was like already past dark and you went in. So we're talking maybe even just earliest of morning hours.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:17 I'm good with getting arrested right off. I'm good with that. But I mean, it's up to everybody.
Kaladen Shash 00:28:27 Yeah, Jonathan, I'd like to know if Find Familiar would be, because isn't that only a first level spell? Yeah. Would that just be like in the hologram library thing on our screen? Because after I meditate for four hours, I want to pay for that first level spell and put it in my book.
Dungeon Master 00:28:40 Yeah, for sure. All right, I like that. Leopold, what are you working on?
Kaladen Shash 00:28:59 School.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:03 Yeah, I wanted to take a look at the library and do a search through the repository on curses that may be inflicting harm on the creatures that Daryl rescued.
Dungeon Master 00:29:22 Yeah, you make your way to the classic library, not just using the wall. Maybe a little more for the old stuff, you know. And as you're looking through, go ahead and roll me. I'm going to get your choice, either Arcana or like Investigation.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:44 Yeah, I feel like this leans more towards Arcana, so I'll make an Arcana check. If it'll go. Did that come through? Yeah, it did, but then the page kind of glitched out.
Kaladen Shash 00:30:09 Could you roll? I didn't see anything land. No bless you. You had guidance previously. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:13 Yeah. Hold on. Let me just do it again. 22. And then I guess, do we have less going on? Okay. Guidance. Got it. 22.
Dungeon Master 00:30:15 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 00:30:21 Um, no, that was guidance, but it already got spent. If you're away from me, then I can't do it.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:45 I can't really hear you if you're trying to talk, Jonathan. Yeah, now I can. Yeah, it went to a different microphone.
Dungeon Master 00:30:49 Can you guys hear me? What the fuck happened there? I don't know what the hell happened. It didn't change anything. It just stopped working.
Kaladen Shash 00:30:50 Yeah, I know we can. It sounded for like a little bit, you were getting really far away and then you just disappeared. Yeah, that's what I thought.
Zariel Torgan 00:30:52 Can now, yeah. It was, yeah, it was kind of funny. I thought you were walking into a different room.
Leopold Magnus 00:31:15 It's weird.
Dungeon Master 00:31:18 Okay, sorry, I don't know what the last thing you heard was, but you made the arcana check, 22, very good. You're reading through it, and I think you figure out pretty quickly that you just need to look up the basics of the curse of lycanthropy, and you're reading through definitions and studied research and all this stuff, and you come to the conclusion that in its base, lycanthropy is a curse
Dungeon Master 00:31:45 gifts all of these benefits while giving like the curse of like the thirst and need to feed and take blood and like indulge in animalistic um like instincts but um as part of it like these are inherently maybe like dire wolves or some other unknown large wolf type
Dungeon Master 00:32:08 it doesn't look super familiar but it has a very basis of that and then it just gets the benefit of being able to like transform temporarily we're around full moons things like that so i think you're like reading through it and you're like okay this is just standard lycanthropy most likely
Leopold Magnus 00:32:31 Okay, so it seemed pretty apparent to solve or cure late stage lycanthropy. Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:32:32 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:32:37 Yeah, so you do some research on that and you figure out that it's not even like at certain stages, it's just like the equivalent of doing a certain spell. But when it's so chronic and they probably already experienced their first full moon and transformation so it's much more solid in their system.
Dungeon Master 00:32:58 Like a ritual based in greater restoration, so it's like a greater restoration plus kind of deal Would be needed to remove it, but it would be possible Would you cast ice knife on You kill the librarian on the way out
Leopold Magnus 00:33:13 Cool. Yeah, I'll dust that book off and hit the road. Ignore those. Ignore those. Clicked in it. What's that guy's name that he showed me around in here?
Kaladen Shash 00:33:22 Silence. Silence.
Dungeon Master 00:33:34 Hold on, I can get it to you. Anything else, though? His name was Victor Holloway.
Leopold Magnus 00:33:46 No. That's right. Which, oddly enough, wasn't that the name of one of our old companions in the previous campaign? That's right. Oh, Holiday. Okay, never mind.
Dungeon Master 00:33:59 Um, no, I, but I think when my friend Eddie played once, his name was something holiday. That's a sick name. No, I think this was just a random name generator name. I think you like were pushing me for somebody to talk to. And I was like, oh yeah, sure.
Zariel Torgan 00:34:13 Yeah, it was Marcel.
Leopold Magnus 00:34:15 Marcel Holliday. Okay. I thought it was just like a call back to that guy. Well, is there also a grand historian Garris? Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:34:16 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 00:34:29 This is his name. There is, yes. You only got to talk to him through like a direct part of a contract. You think that's probably somebody who's like doesn't take walk-in appointments kind of deal.
Leopold Magnus 00:34:47 I see. Okay. Well, maybe I'll try to set an appointment with him if it's not too late in the evening. Does he have like a secretary?
Dungeon Master 00:34:53 Yeah, you find Victor sort of perusing and organizing, just catching him on a lucky swing of shift. And he goes, oh my, you look awful. Sort of eyeing you up and down.
Dungeon Master 00:35:13 your beat up form covered in blood and gore and like still a little bit dented, haven't fully healed yet, but you seem like you're cheering yourself. And he asked you sort of what you're looking for, but he gives you the ability. He's like, yeah, I can.
Dungeon Master 00:35:29 I can take a note, I suppose. And so he takes down your name, and he like sort of writes, it's like the memo. He's like, and what will you be meeting about, sort of quizzically looking at you? Just hit him across my face.
Leopold Magnus 00:35:45 Oh, yes. And I'm going to, like, on my chest piece, bump out a little dent. Maybe some blood goes kind of splattering. Yes, I was just curious if you could set me a meeting with Grand Historian Garris. It's Leopold Magnus. And I have some rather interesting matters that I'd like to pick his brain upon.
Dungeon Master 00:36:10 Sure, sounds easy enough. And you said that was Leo, you see he like spells it out very straightforward for you. And he says, I will make notes, we will, and he looks at you and he goes, you as part of the Legionnaire have ability to take in sending messages, correct?
Leopold Magnus 00:36:35 Of course, yes, you can reach me anytime. Why, thank you very much.
Dungeon Master 00:36:39 Perfect. I will reach out to VS Sending to discuss this. Once we have a set date, I'll inform you. Well, thank you. He seems more impressed by your professionalism after he wiped sort of the sort of old coagulating blood off his face. So flicks it towards the ground with like a little snide face at first, but taken by your pleasant.
Dungeon Master 00:37:11 If we don't, anything else? Sweet. Once you get back to your room, I presume you will open the workshop one last time. Cool.
Leopold Magnus 00:37:20 Nope.
Zariel Torgan 00:37:37 Yeah. Give them a good spot to hang out. Well, it's good to kennel train young. You know, you got to set these standards early. So, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:37:43 Get back into your private room, close the door, open the workshop. You can keep them down in there with just the workshop open if you'd like. That would be pretty convenient, because it's like a ladder down into an interdimensional space. And then sort of decompress. All right.
Kaladen Shash 00:38:00 You know.
Dungeon Master 00:38:11 then you guys, I think would probably, uh, bed down for the night. Perfect. Go ahead and take your long rest. Not plagued by any nightmares on this night. No rogue dreams. You sleep hard from the hard fought that you had hard fight.
Zariel Torgan 00:38:19 Yeah, I'm good to just conk out.
Dungeon Master 00:38:34 Go ahead and take your level up. And then we can say we'll do it all at once just to keep it exciting in the middle. You guys wake up early. We'll have the dialogue with, is it Leonora or just Leora? I think it's just Leora. With Leora. It is Leora.
Kaladen Shash 00:38:51 We are.
Dungeon Master 00:38:55 like pretty early if you'd like so you just like get up early you know that she trains early go talk to her she gives you the tokens and then we'll we'll just talk about the conversation later but you guys can go ahead and roll for the table if you'd like to and that way you can add everything well i won't have the items made but i'll let you know what you get at least yeah first is a level
Zariel Torgan 00:39:10 Yeah, who wants to go first? Oh, yeah, I'll do that real quick.
Leopold Magnus 00:39:15 Oh, for the coin. Cool.
Kaladen Shash 00:39:21 It's a D1 to the D100, so we're wrong. How much gold did we get if we stayed, or what's the split?
Dungeon Master 00:39:25 You guys are way too item-driven. Oh, geez. Hold on. I have it somewhere. Give me a moment. Take your level up. I'll let you know.
Dungeon Master 00:39:54 Where did I write that down?
Zariel Torgan 00:40:02 So you're saying that we.
Leopold Magnus 00:40:14 Each completed mission typically rewards 100 gold. However, you can choose to participate in the lottery. Oh, I see it here. It says you receive reduced payment of 62 gold and 50 silver along with the token. Does that sound correct?
Dungeon Master 00:40:23 It was raised, though. Yeah, it was changed, though. When you guys got your promotion, it is a 125 gold standard. And it was 45 of cut. I think I had misspoken before because I didn't have it written down. But typed in my notes is you each get 125 gold on completion.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:35 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:40:54 and then a fraction of that with the lotto token. 45 gold and a token. Okay, what are you guys doing for your level up?
Kaladen Shash 00:40:59 OK, so what's the fraction we have? OK, sweet. I don't know. I know exactly what I'm going to take as far as which class, but I don't know.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:07 Oh, you get feet? Nice.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:20 Yeah. Are you getting a seat?
Kaladen Shash 00:41:28 what feet I want to do or just want to do.
Dungeon Master 00:41:34 Mhm. Mhm.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:38 Hey, I got a dumb question. As I've been doing my hit points, it's, let's see, it's saying that my total fixed hit points is 52. And every time, I haven't been doing fixed, I've been doing rolled. And so it's higher than that. Because we don't take like ones or twos or whatever.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:02 But every time I level up, it erases it, and I have to remember what it was. Is there a way to have it not do that? It erases... Oh. Yeah, it erases my override HP every time I level. Because I just rolled that 6.
Kaladen Shash 00:42:07 Yeah, shouldn't be.
Dungeon Master 00:42:10 It shouldn't be doing that, does it? Why do you have an override HB? But you can change fix.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:27 Well, because the only way it lets me put in a rolled amount is if I put it in override, because I have fixed. Oh, how do I do that?
Dungeon Master 00:42:39 Hold on, I can do it right now. Yes. Do you remember what your overwriting key is, Jesse?
Leopold Magnus 00:42:49 Okay, just so I remember correctly, I would just roll a 1d8 because that's the hit die for the artificer, which is the level I'm taking. Okay, and then I would add that to my rolled
Zariel Torgan 00:43:03 What was that, Jonathan? I think it was 67 from when I was level 6 and then I just rolled a 6. So it'd be... Go ahead. Okay, I'm gonna refresh it.
Dungeon Master 00:43:09 Do you remember what your actual HP was? Cool. Yeah, I changed it to manual so you can put in the actual number, and it should keep it. Nice, good health roll. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:43:27 Ooh, seven. Yeah, OK, so then I go in here and I just add seven to my rolled HP. Above average, so I'll take it.
Dungeon Master 00:43:51 Oh, yeah. And once you're done with that, go ahead and roll your D100 and divide it by two. And I'll just do it as he goes already. Nice. Also, go ahead and roll me a D6.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:55 Okay, that was... 8d10.
Leopold Magnus 00:44:05 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 00:44:08 And Jonathan, I'm gonna go ahead and roll my D10 for health. Who rolls a D6, me?
Dungeon Master 00:44:28 Yeah, you. No, it grows one centimeter overnight. I'm kidding. It grows in it. It's not a centimeter. I'll give you an inch.
Leopold Magnus 00:44:33 How's your health role there, Colin? Bye.
Kaladen Shash 00:44:36 It's going to take one day to grow my arm. One day. Oh, get out of here. No. Rats.
Zariel Torgan 00:44:39 Nice. Jesus Christ. Oh, that's awesome. Oh, God. Funny.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:05 So it looks like all I got was access to fourth level spells. Ooh, there's some good ones in here. Yeah. Damn, look at these spells. These are gnarly. I'm going to start taking some time with that. All right, who's already rolled the D100?
Dungeon Master 00:45:12 Nice. And then 53 divided by 225 around.
Kaladen Shash 00:45:12 At level seven? That sounds right. You're straight up seven druid now, right? They start getting fun.
Dungeon Master 00:45:34 Leopold, you pull the item out of the machine and it spits out in like a medium-sized ceramic egg a beautiful golden fork. Sort of scuff it a little bit.
Leopold Magnus 00:45:37 Oh, this might be kind of interesting, and I'm going to whack it until it starts vibrating. It's kind of
Zariel Torgan 00:45:48 Oh, shit. I bet I know what that is. Oh, that's not what I thought it was. Yeah, me too.
Dungeon Master 00:46:04 You see, it's like a four-pronged fork. It's like an eating utensil. You can, but you can also wait until everybody does it and we'll do it at the same time.
Leopold Magnus 00:46:09 Oh, OK, OK. I thought it was nice. I thought it was like a tuning fork. I was just going to disappear. I guess, can I do identify on that? Yeah, perfect.
Dungeon Master 00:46:33 Yours is a fun one, though. Nice.
Zariel Torgan 00:46:33 Is it eucalyptus?
Kaladen Shash 00:46:36 Yeah, I'm trying to get my back over to that screen here. One on the. No Brooklyn 35. If I. No, OK.
Dungeon Master 00:47:01 Okay. I really love this one, actually. Okay. You put the token in and it spits out this tiny little egg and it lands in your hand. It is way heavier than you think it would be for how small it is. Not like crazy heavy, but you think it's going to be like an ounce or two and it like catches your hand for a second.
Dungeon Master 00:47:31 You crack it open and you see a tiny little sort of navy blue bean. Do with that what you will.
Zariel Torgan 00:48:02 All right, we're ready for me? Sweet. Well.
Dungeon Master 00:48:08 Yeah. 12 divided by 2. OK, you see.
Dungeon Master 00:48:34 that a sort of just cupped hand sized egg sort of rolls out of the like lotto machine and when you crack it open you see it is this like seashell type
Dungeon Master 00:48:52 shaped like almost like a clamshell but flat of this beautiful iridescent material. It doesn't look like a shell but definitely something much more precious than that. And it sort of has this iridescent sheen over it. But without identifying it you wouldn't know. But it's a beautiful necklace. It's attached to a nice like long threaded rope. Beautifully braided.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:18 Interesting. Is the actual necklace part that holds it is that you said it was like rope, not metal? Interesting. Sweet. Okay, cool. And then how much gold did we get along with that? I missed.
Dungeon Master 00:49:25 Like just like a nice threaded rope. Like this looks old. It's not like frayed or anything, but it's not like a chain link necklace. Right. 45 each.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:47 Sweet. Paladin, just go ahead and take my 45 gold. I think you gave me like 300 or something, something crazy. I already have everything I need, so.
Kaladen Shash 00:49:47 John, would I know anything about mine, or could I cast identify and figure out where it is? That's cool. Love that. Yeah. Yeah. OK, cool, cool.
Dungeon Master 00:49:55 You guys identify just figured we would do it all at once get them into like a little circle will cast.
Dungeon Master 00:50:20 Okay, um, we'll do all these descriptions. And then I'm going to go take a quick break and eat a little bit of food, but I'll be back like, five minutes, I'm just gonna grab it. So we'll take a little breather.
Kaladen Shash 00:50:31 No, you're perfect. That's great. So let me look at some stuff. Oh, OK.
Zariel Torgan 00:50:31 Wait. Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:50:36 Nice. We'll start backwards to forward. Zariel, you have this necklace identified and it is titled the Astral Shell. This beautiful shell allows you to interrogate the souls of the deceased. You can use your action to cast Speak with Dead without expending a spell slot. The target corpse does not require a mouth as the voice of the deceased is heard from within the shell. Once cast, the shell cannot be used to get into the nest. Dusk.
Kaladen Shash 00:51:06 Cool, dusk to dusk, I like that.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:07 So you get it once a day or once dusk to dusk, speak with dead, no spell slot. That's fantastic. No, that's awesome. Sweet.
Dungeon Master 00:51:12 And it doesn't have to have a mouse. So if you get creative with that, we can make that work. Cool. Kaladin, yours I think is very funny, but it's also pretty cool. It is called the Heavy Bean.
Dungeon Master 00:51:35 This small navy bean weighs one pound. You use your reaction to put the bean in your mouth or spit it into your hand. While in your mouth, your weight increases by a factor of 10, giving you advantage in ability tricks and saving throws made to resist being shoved, knocked, thrown, or otherwise moved against your will. When the bean's property has been used for a total of one minute, it cannot be used again until the next dawn. If the bean is eaten, it loses its magical properties.
Kaladen Shash 00:52:05 okay so it weighs one it weighs one pound and then whenever i put it in my mouth it makes me 10 times heavier so and gives me advantage on saving throws against being shoved or thrown or so that says that so would that be like a strength check like well how is that going to help you know what i mean what is that
Leopold Magnus 00:52:06 I want to eat that bean.
Dungeon Master 00:52:09 A one pound bean. An ability check. And saving throws, both of them.
Dungeon Master 00:52:29 like if somebody makes a shove attack on you and it's a post-athletics or um you if it's like a dexterity saving throw to be knocked prone and you have it in your mouth or whatever it just like gives you advantage on those checks to be like moved against your will to some extent nope
Kaladen Shash 00:52:40 Cool, so that, does it need attunement? And can it just be in my mouth then? And like, I just needed, it says,
Zariel Torgan 00:52:52 Damn.
Dungeon Master 00:52:57 Once you activate, yeah, so like would you throw it in your mouth? Just make sure you don't swallow it. Or it says you can put it in your mouth and then into your hand. Mm-hmm. Continues. You have one minute of it.
Kaladen Shash 00:53:12 OK, so the mouth is just the activation. And the hand, the effect continues or stops? OK. All right, cool, cool, cool. Be fun.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:27 Sweet.
Dungeon Master 00:53:33 And then, Leopold, you pulled the Glutton's Fork. This beautiful golden fork has three charges and regains all charges daily at dawn. You can use an action to spend one charge to target a non-magical object within five feet that weighs no more than one pound. The object is magically transformed into food and can be consumed as a bonus action to regain 1d6 hit points.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:01 Damn. That's pretty sweet.
Leopold Magnus 00:54:02 Cool, now I'm gonna turn your bean into food. That's a good point. So 1D6 hit points three times a day. Yeah, well, I can add, so they just get absorbed into my armor, I guess. How's that look?
Dungeon Master 00:54:04 Isn't that fucking sick? I just said non-magical. Yep, you just eat inanimate objects. I don't know, man.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:32 Just eating, yeah, nuts and bolts and just yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:54:32 being armor. That's interesting. I like it. Yeah, we can say that like you can artifice tinker it to like a compartment in your body and you basically create an in game mechanic where Leopold I can feed in a man inanimate objects into his armor to
Leopold Magnus 00:54:35 We're going to have to figure this out. Like knickknacks, odds and ends are just going in the gullet. Yeah, it'll regain me my strength.
Dungeon Master 00:55:03 like mechanically give himself regain hit points. You guys wake up. What would you like to do first thing?
Leopold Magnus 00:55:07 Farewell.
Zariel Torgan 00:55:09 Sweet. That's cool. That's a cool one. Do you want to talk to our lead lady?
Kaladen Shash 00:55:33 Yes.
Dungeon Master 00:55:33 Yeah, go for it.
Zariel Torgan 00:55:36 Is she just out in the fighting pits like before, or do we have to track her down?
Dungeon Master 00:55:44 You see, like I said, this pretty early hours, you actually see her and the small gnome of her like sort of adventuring party at like the archery section, just sort of shooting short bows, getting practice bullshitting. As you guys walk up, you see she almost doesn't even notice you at first. She goes, oh shit, hey.
Dungeon Master 00:56:08 Morning, y'all. You, uh, look better than you did last night. If I'm being honest, we, uh, we kind of talked about it all morning. You look like shit. Sorry. Um, what can I help you with? Oh, damn. Your arm looks at it looks really, oh, it's kind of cute. Uh, what the fuck happened?
Zariel Torgan 00:56:19 Thank you.
Kaladen Shash 00:56:19 I have no I have no arm. How do I look better? How big is it? How big is it now? Is it really only an inch longer? OK.
Dungeon Master 00:56:38 Yeah. It grows every six hours, so partway through the day, because it happened way before, partway through the day you'll get to roll again, and then you'll get to roll at night.
Kaladen Shash 00:56:50 I got your OK, OK cool. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:56:51 So is it like Deadpool regeneration, where there's a little tiny hand, or is it just getting a little longer? Interesting. He's just carrying a plant.
Dungeon Master 00:56:57 Yeah, except at this point it's not a hand, it's like a sapling. It's like a little tiny plant growing, like a little tree growing out of the nub of where his humerus would be. And it's too small at this point to be defined as another arm or anything like that.
Dungeon Master 00:57:21 He's, yeah, it's like, I think if I remember it correctly, you said above elbow amputation. So like three quarters of the way through the bicep, you just see this tiny little green tree growing out of his arm.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:32 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:57:41 She shoots you a quizzical look and then goes, uh, uh, a various to the ODS. Uh, I said, you look like shit. What'd you guys get up to? Oh, nice. And you guys, um, you're alive. So I assume you were successful.
Kaladen Shash 00:57:57 We took down a large lichen. I had to stop, I had to stop the curse. I lost my arm. Yes, of course. What else would we do?
Dungeon Master 00:58:14 Beautiful. You guys make my job so easy. I love that. And at this point, you see this is when she looks at her and she goes, oh shit, puts down the ale she was drinking in between shots, goes over to the counter, goes to reach behind, pulls something out, counts it, she goes, okay, and walks back up and tosses you each one of the tokens. She goes, yeah, maybe he even told you,
Zariel Torgan 00:58:26 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:58:43 Ratchet and I sort of pioneered this to be as big as it was. It used to just be something between all of the Legionnaires back in the day. We would just sort of trade between ourselves, but we figured, what if we could make it bigger than that? Pretty cool stuff. Anyway, she gives you the gold as well, and she goes, I think if I remember correctly, you guys are going to get a pretty good promotion after this.
Dungeon Master 00:59:12 Um, sorry, not promotion, new mission, not promoted yet. And she seems to sort of scattered. She goes, uh, um, anyway, I think we're done. No further orders at this point. Um, don't spend all your money in one place. Oh, geez. And then she goes, oh, and a very non very shallowly trying to be nonchalant.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:23 Now that I'm a giant robot. Uh.
Dungeon Master 00:59:38 Just goes, yeah, Zario, can we talk to you for a second? Just like on the side would be pretty cool. You guys sort of walk over to the counter.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:51 Yeah, uh, privately? Do we, is this not something for everybody? Uh, yeah, sure, I'll, I'll head over.
Dungeon Master 01:00:09 Maybe just like she switches out her drink to a coffee, offers you one too, and she goes, how are you feeling? You doing all right? I mean, she goes, that was really startling. I'm not going to lie. But luckily for you guys, you're not the first mechanical person
Zariel Torgan 01:00:19 Well, I can't help but think this is probably related to my change in appearance.
Dungeon Master 01:00:39 raises an eyebrow person being in your party. So I got a little bit sort of tip my toe in beforehand. But no, I am. I can I can smell you, you. Do they know that you are cursed? You tell them.
Zariel Torgan 01:01:00 Um, do they know? I don't know. Maybe not. Wait, isn't there something about being oreforged where you can't? I'm misremembering.
Dungeon Master 01:01:22 Um, I left the choice up to you guys because Leopold Um Being just like a pseudo. No, I think I already thought this through. Um, there's something different about you that makes it so you can But we when I asked rex and we sort of talked about it him being basically just like like he's truly like gears and cores and like he's like actually
Zariel Torgan 01:01:38 Hmm, okay
Dungeon Master 01:01:50 very mechanical in appearance if you really examine him, whereas yours is like a very biological form of like being a robot. It's much different.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:03 Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay yeah. I guess not. I guess not. Everybody knows. Well, maybe not. I'm not quite sure what it means, me being this way. Do you have any suggestions?
Dungeon Master 01:02:28 She goes, well, I fucked up and I missed the mark. It had been so long since the last full moon that I didn't really realize it was going to be that hard to get rid of until it was too late. But if this just happened last night or the day before even, there's like somewhat expensive, but there are potions you can buy.
Dungeon Master 01:02:52 high clerics you can seek out and for the cost of materials and time you can they'll charge you a fee to remove it you do have there are options i suppose but um i guess i didn't even recognize if you knew or not um
Dungeon Master 01:03:10 And also be careful. I don't know how it works this close to it, but it's it was a full moon last night. And if it sticks around one more night, you might have trouble tonight. Just. Separate yourself. She looks very concerned.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:26 Yeah. Well, thank you for the info. I'll have to discuss it with my compatriots and see what we can do. Nah, nah, we'll handle it. We're professionals. It's all right. Happens.
Dungeon Master 01:03:37 Because I don't think I need to explain why you losing control of this would be an issue. OK. Sorry, by the way. Right. Now that I've thought about it, it just took me a second to think of it.
Dungeon Master 01:04:05 You will probably be sought out by the captain, Captain Levi, on your next assignment if you guys are ready for it. So just seek him out and he'll be sort of your next touch base. He sort of was part of the planning process for the last one that didn't go so well. So he'll have more information than I will. But happy hunting on the lotto, fellas. Sort of addresses the rest of you as she backs up back to the archery and she goes,
Dungeon Master 01:04:35 Good work on that one. That took you just about a day and a half. Good process.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:41 Sweet. So is there anything specifically you guys want to get done?
Kaladen Shash 01:05:02 I don't think there's anything. Top of mind, we have nothing new to talk about, like the uppers with. Jonathan, just for size sake, the werewolf we fought the the female werewolf. Was it comparable to the one that we saw through the breach in the dome? They were similar size and talked about that, OK?
Dungeon Master 01:05:15 Mm-hmm. Yeah, no, they looked very similar. They just had slightly different features, different musculature. One was a little bit larger, and it was the one in the market district, but not by a substantial portion, just both very large and much larger than the general werewolf's usual.
Dungeon Master 01:05:56 What's the plan, fellas? This is like mid-morning at this point. You woke up early, talked with Leora, went to the lotto, got your things, and then this is after that. This is as you guys are sort of deciding what to do with your day.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:56 Jonathan, can I, um, I guess what time of day is it? Are we, are we headed out? Do we have some time to kill?
Kaladen Shash 01:06:03 It's very early. Would it be worth going to Hamhawk? Would things be done at this point? That's all I'm waiting on is the dragon skill.
Dungeon Master 01:06:27 I think you were just waiting on your armor, so probably.
Kaladen Shash 01:06:33 whatnot. Sweet, yeah, that's my really only to-do. Grow an arm all day and get armor.
Zariel Torgan 01:06:42 Yeah, I think I already got everything from Hamhawk. I'm pretty much ready to rock.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:53 Yeah, I'm ready to roll with Hamhawk, but I did have one thing I wanted to do in our downtime. I wanted to go in the toolbox and work on the automaton I found. I'm investigating it, seeing if there's any improvements maybe I can make to my Steel Defender, generally researching it.
Dungeon Master 01:07:02 What you got? Yeah, go ahead and give me you said you want to make an investigation. Yeah, go ahead.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:23 Yeah. Wait.
Dungeon Master 01:07:32 21 pretty good. You've got like we'll say this figure like up laid on its back on sort of just one of your workbenches and you've got all these instruments around it set up sort of peeling back its outer shell. It's like
Dungeon Master 01:07:49 its black guard armor and then through its actual framed body and like fake musculature of metal. And you're like looking at the gears and you've seen all these power cores. You pulled sort of the biggest one when you made your adjustments to your saber.
Dungeon Master 01:08:07 But you're looking through, and there's still very faint arcane resonance rushing through this. But I think with the 21, it's good enough to be like, you would have had this hunch that this looked like you, but way more advanced. And you're going through this, and you're mapping out different areas of its framework and its mechanisms. And you come to the full realization that this
Dungeon Master 01:08:34 is your body but if it was really advanced so it's not even just a suspicion anymore you're like okay i made a joke about this being me 2.0 but this like legit is which i think is very interesting um i hadn't seen it going this way where you sort of have the body to investigate but this looks like your design
Leopold Magnus 01:08:58 Interesting. Do I by chance find any mention of Victor? Like a serial number or a stamp or something that might stand out. 23.
Dungeon Master 01:09:09 uh give me you had that 21 I can't go ahead and give me a history check with advantage to remember something that happened in the past.
Dungeon Master 01:09:26 So good, you're killing this. This is like you have this thought as you're like, you say you've got like these little tools in your hand and a light sort of hanging down and you're very much in it and you think and you're like, oh shit. And then like you put it together in an instant and you remember when you were making the saber and you were looking at that arcane core that had like the property of, forget his name at this point, but the wind rider fella.
Dungeon Master 01:09:54 But the Lord of Advancement was his name. It had his initials. When you were sort of putting it in your sword to make it function, you saw these markings that didn't make sense at the time.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:54 No, that's right. Add his initials.
Dungeon Master 01:10:10 you think about it and you're like oh shit it was upside down and it's not in common it's in like this um like tinkering language it's like how you put your runes down and it very uh unironically ironically spelled out victor in these ruins like a custom enchantment which you didn't recognize at first because it wasn't a written language and it was upside down but like thinking back you're like oh shit
Zariel Torgan 01:10:23 Have a great day.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:35 Interesting. Okay. I'll file that away and maybe make some detailed notes. Hopefully I can keep kind of digging through this and find some improvements I can make on my own armor. But for now, I'll call it a day.
Dungeon Master 01:10:52 Yeah, I think with having access to this specific body, if you spend time on it and materials and some sort of money in it, you can absolutely map out advancements you can make to yourself. In case you can.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:07 Right.
Kaladen Shash 01:11:12 Excellent. Can I visit him, Mark?
Dungeon Master 01:11:20 takes a little bit of time, teleport to the right district, get there, walk in, see Hamhock, she goes, you see, she's like,
Dungeon Master 01:11:30 like a little paints out. And she's got like the very faintest of like a dark red highlight and very close just painting on like the tips of the scales. You see as she lays down the paint, it seems to be made from some sort of oil base. It like lays down and glows and then fades and seems to like the magic pulse into it. And then finally the last one, the whole thing sort of resonates red and then fades to normal. She goes, oh, hey.
Dungeon Master 01:12:00 Long time no see. It's been like a day. Yeah, actually it just finished. You guys had great timing. Chucks it at you, sort of catch it in your chest with a heft as Amok's got a lot of strength behind it. And if you didn't already see, you have the armor in your inventory already.
Kaladen Shash 01:12:03 Yes, you said you could take care of it quickly. Oh, it didn't last. Better.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:05 Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:12:33 Oh. It's giving him disadvantage on stealth, but I think we said it was just going to be like a shoulder pad, so it won't do that. I just need to change that. What was that, Rex? If you go with Kaladin, yeah, you can be in the workshop.
Leopold Magnus 01:12:37 So, are we in Hammock's workshop still? We're still in the workshop, right? Or did only Caledon go? Yeah, I'll go with him. And I think after they've
Kaladen Shash 01:12:47 Okay, cool.
Dungeon Master 01:13:04 I figure you go there every chance you get.
Leopold Magnus 01:13:06 have their exchange. I'm assuming Hamhawk has a lot of bits and bobs, scrap laying around, maybe like something pretty solid, a chair or something maybe inconsequential laying around.
Dungeon Master 01:13:23 Yeah, you can just see like hunks of scrap metal all around it. Like you see like in the room that you're currently in is like the nice sort of magically enchanted workshop that she uses to like enchant all of her items and craft very specific things with fine precise movement. But like back on the other side of the room, there's like a lot of metal by like this forge. It just looks like extra trim and scrapping and like various things that you could probably set a ledge if you wanted to.
Leopold Magnus 01:13:53 Okay, yeah, for now I'm just gonna show off. I'm gonna come up here and I'm just gonna slice one of these broken workbenches in two with my sword. Just, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:14:06 Good.
Dungeon Master 01:14:07 Just the sword ignites, spewing the sparks of extra energy. As you cut through the table, you see it perfectly. There's like tears on the edge, glowing red of the wood as it goes all the way down, scorches the floor. And Hannah goes, what the fuck? Holy shit. Why? Just like walks over. She goes, I was going to fucking fix this bench. Sort of at the moment, a little more obsessed with the fact that she cut the table and she looks and she goes,
Dungeon Master 01:14:37 You finished it, holy shit. She goes, it's fine. Little jealousy as you look like on one of the tables behind her shoulder is like the unfinished weapon. More advanced than it was, but still missing like a powerful enough arcane core to support what you had proposed.
Leopold Magnus 01:14:41 Oh, wise indeed, Hamhawk. How is your sword coming along? Well, that's quite a shame. You could have had
Zariel Torgan 01:14:47 Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 01:15:12 Well, may I say I'm an adept apprentice on your hand, and I'll spin around and cut another chunk off the table with the sword. Well, I suppose we could call it water under the bridge, if you take a quick look.
Dungeon Master 01:15:18 Fucking stop, dude. Holy shit. Come on. She goes, I mean, but she goes, I mean, can I look at it and then we'll call it even?
Zariel Torgan 01:15:21 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:15:35 You see, holds her big mitt of a handout, grabs it and sort of flicks it over, not ignited or activated, just looking at the pommel and how you stored the core. And then she goes, I mean, truly nice work. Leopold, this is fantastic. I mean, you remember when we first met, you didn't even know how to build anything. This is pretty fucking cool.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:08 Well, I did learn from the best, says Ham Hock's finest apprentice. And I take a bow. Oh, oh dear, oh dear. I'm jumping, jumping for joy. Maybe I'll...
Kaladen Shash 01:16:14 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:16:16 You know what, I'll let you have that. That was really endearing. Wasn't over the top, that was real nice. Consider your repressionship official. Sort of hitting the ground with that heavy thud, things are falling, she goes, okay, fucking stop, holy shit, please.
Leopold Magnus 01:16:41 Yes, of course, of course, Master.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:45 eh eh eh eh
Dungeon Master 01:16:46 I mean, really cool. Can't wait to see what you do next. And then looks at Kaladin, she goes, Finora. As you finish like clasping on the large shoulder piece, sort of goes to,
Kaladen Shash 01:16:58 Yes, very good, feels nice.
Dungeon Master 01:17:08 The length is up to you. In my head, I pictured the farthest point of the shoulder pad almost to like your elbow, like way down your arm and sort of cuts up partway through the pec and then wraps around the back with like a simple strap going over the other shoulder. I mean, like under the other arm and around it, sort of securing it to place. And then that just goes over your normal armor is like appearance goes. But if you want it to be different than that, feel free to change that.
Kaladen Shash 01:17:29 Yeah. Yeah, that's great. No, it's going to be great. Yeah, that's on my armored. That's my armored. That's my real arm. My stumpy is just unprotected. No, it's OK. I just wanted one shoulder pad. That thing's going to be a tree trunk in a minute. Don't worry.
Dungeon Master 01:17:46 Love it. Real lopsided. Nice. Yeah. Like I said, I'll remove the disadvantage. I don't know why it's there. But you get that. I think I have it. If you equip it, what does it take it to?
Kaladen Shash 01:18:03 And then what was the overall armor class you were intending? It's at 18. It was the same as my previous. Perfect. I just get the fire resistance. Love that. Love that. All right, sweet, sweet.
Dungeon Master 01:18:18 Yeah, it's the same. Yeah, it just gives you extra stuff. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:18:33 Kim Hawkins, always wonderful work. Love what you do. Keep it up. Your apprentice is very good, too.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:39 hehehehehehehehehehe
Leopold Magnus 01:18:43 Indeed, none from the finest. One last thing, Hamhawk, before I go. Would you mind if I take some of these bits and bobs? And I point over in the corner with all the spare scrap. Oh, thank you. I will return the favor in due time.
Dungeon Master 01:18:57 She looks at it, she goes, uh, don't go crazy, but yeah, you can take some. I guess that's nice. Can I get back to my fucking enchantments? I got a big order just from the Legionnaire just now.
Kaladen Shash 01:19:11 Did you get your ring off the 3D printer?
Dungeon Master 01:19:21 It can be busy for a little bit. Sort of like looks back and forth. Might not be able to talk. See ya.
Zariel Torgan 01:19:32 Yeah, I got it after we died and came back. You see that? Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:19:45 Love this badger. This is good. Yeah, hey Rex, are you doing me a favor? Will you drop the link to the image generator back into the chat? So I can have it again.
Leopold Magnus 01:19:49 Jonathan, can I have just generic building supplies to my Bob the Builder badger? That's crazy. Oh yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:19:57 I typed in transformers, like, transformer style, and I think it did, like, cartoon transformers. I think I got that ring last time. I think the only thing I wanted to do, Jonathan,
Dungeon Master 01:19:57 Yeah, go for it. Come on. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:26 If I could just zip it in real quick, because I wanted to try to train the puppies a little bit. I wanted to just start basic training. Like sit, stay, follow, things like that. So I'm just doing it while they're gone, because I didn't need to go out and do anything. So just however long they're out, I'll do this for.
Kaladen Shash 01:20:34 Well.
Dungeon Master 01:20:42 I mean, like how much time are you guys all spending to each of these tasks? Okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:55 I mean, maybe we should have a couple of rest days. You're missing an arm, Caledon. Yeah, that's a good point. Like if we need to go fast, then yeah, we should go. But maybe we can take a little time. Or an hour.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:00 You know, that's not a terrible idea. That's true. Well, we've got clout now. They can wait for us.
Kaladen Shash 01:21:02 Well, it depends on once we talk to the higher ups, if they're like, Hey, the mission goes in. Two days, three days, like whatever, like we're ready to go. Yes. We will.
Leopold Magnus 01:21:28 Fair point.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:29 Heh heh heh heh
Kaladen Shash 01:21:31 We'll take care of what we need to. Don't worry, my arm is coming back quickly. Look at what time it is. Should I roll a D6?
Dungeon Master 01:21:41 Yeah, we'll say you guys, you take an afternoon. We'll take it day by day. We'll split it sort of split up a bunch because if you guys think of something you just kind of want to do, go ahead and go for it. But after like another six hours or so, Zarya, I'll say the first one will be pretty easy, not too hard. You spend it because it takes a while to train dogs. There are wild animals.
Dungeon Master 01:22:07 So you get like basic motion recognition where if you force them into like getting it for the reward over treat sometimes you see you go to do it in their head sort of follow it first or they'll take a step but very hesitant and it's early stages but you are getting them to do basic commands within the first part of the day.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:07 Uh huh.
Dungeon Master 01:22:36 And then, yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:22:41 You want me to roll a d6? Oh my gosh, get out of here.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:50 God damn. Get him out now.
Dungeon Master 01:22:53 It grows another inch. But you see that now that it's two inches long, it's got a little bit of girth, and it is almost triangle-shaped, where as it grows, it gets a little bit fatter at the base and sort of cones up towards the top. And you see the little leaves sort of spread out, and you have the tiniest little three fingers poking out of the top of the little nub growing out now.
Leopold Magnus 01:22:57 That's that's lame.
Kaladen Shash 01:23:20 Were these potions verified? Was this quality checked? This thing doesn't feel like working correctly. I have no, I have no money. I can't, no money to copy a spell. Can't do anything.
Zariel Torgan 01:23:23 Awful. Potion from Teemu. Oh, shit.
Dungeon Master 01:23:29 You got it out of arcane lot of it. You have 90.
Leopold Magnus 01:23:33 Yeah, you're shopping like a billionaire.
Kaladen Shash 01:23:54 I have 90 gold. I already spent 50 of that 90 already on that first level spell. I'm familiar. I've done what I've wanted to for right now. No. I didn't take any of that.
Dungeon Master 01:23:56 Plus whatever split of the 150 you found. Oh, I'm familiar. Yeah. Huh?
Zariel Torgan 01:24:13 Well, did we split the 150 we got three ways, or does everybody have... Well, I didn't take any of it either, so if we wanted to just say we split it three ways, and then everybody would have 90 additional from this interaction, I'd just give you another 50, because, like I said, I think you gave me like 200 or 300, so that'd give you another 50.
Kaladen Shash 01:24:36 Yeah, sure. OK, that's perfect. 140 I might peruse the. The level one and twos and see if I want to. Write something in the old spell book. Is it safe to assume level two spells are like widely understood and like just this is like pretty basic knowledge like there on the screens.
Dungeon Master 01:24:41 Do you have 100 additional gold if you take the 2 thirds of that 150? Yes, unless it's like a very specific magic school, like I would say,
Zariel Torgan 01:24:46 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:25:10 Some psychic spells might be a little bit harder to find, but yeah, anything that you would deem and I trust your judgment on is like very standard. You could just copy over at the cost. No, it is is from the wizard spell list.
Kaladen Shash 01:25:10 Can I copy other? As a wizard, can I copy other spell classes, spells in my book? That's what I thought, I saw the wizard spell list, okay, okay. That's why I was like, wait a second.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:34 That would've been cool.
Dungeon Master 01:25:39 As a wizard, you could cast scrolls and stuff of other spells, like most classes, but with much greater ease. But yeah, you can learn them. If you wanted to, you could also look at a spell.
Kaladen Shash 01:25:45 Right at higher levels. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:25:57 And you as a player, even if you wanted, could try to create your own spell that does a similar effect that could be more wizard-based. And then you just spend some time and energy into making the spell. And then you can have your own spells named after Kaladin. Something wizards can do.
Kaladen Shash 01:26:15 It's fun.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:16 Nice. Well, all I've got planned for this whole few days is training those dogs. So whenever we want to chat with the higher-ups and get a timeline, if we're going to go day by day, I'll just be doing that, just to make it easy. That's all I've got planned.
Dungeon Master 01:26:43 All right. So that's the second part of the first day. Going into that first night on break, you do more animal handling. Go ahead and give me another, you can give me an animal handling check, and since you're taking so long to do it, you can do it with advantage.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:04 All right. Let's see what we got. Mmm, 11. Yeah, just real basics.
Dungeon Master 01:27:14 And you're doing like sit and stay, right? You see they're getting, not as a trick, but as a command, they're sort of getting it. Maybe a little bit slower than you like, but you notice right off the bat that they'll need more work, and they don't hold it for very long. They do it, and then they'll get a little antsy, and they'll pick their butts up.
Dungeon Master 01:27:40 as they sort of forget. It needs some work, but you've definitely got the basics down. First night gone. You guys wake up in the next day. Anybody trying to do anything specific on a second day? Oh, go ahead and roll another D6.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:41 All right, getting better. And we leveled up, right?
Kaladen Shash 01:28:03 Loudly. Get out of your screen. I'm on fire. I'm on fire. Three of those in a row. The odds a lot one. No. Yep.
Leopold Magnus 01:28:12 I was going to keep working on the Omen Knight that I found. So I'd like to be able to incorporate any
Zariel Torgan 01:28:18 Oh my God. Jesus.
Dungeon Master 01:28:18 A Blackguard. Not much growth. Maybe you're a little dehydrated, you know? Leopold, what are you looking for specifically?
Leopold Magnus 01:28:42 improvements that are in this suit of armor into my steel defender. So maybe a way that it looks like it's swinging its sword or actuating or something so that way maybe it could swing the sword a bit heavier or maybe have a ranged capability or just kind of poking around, seeing if there's anything I can glean off of to improve my defender.
Dungeon Master 01:29:11 How much damage does it do?
Leopold Magnus 01:29:14 I think it's like a d6 or something. Let me look. Yeah, the problem is, is he's not actually a familiar or something that I can like set out. So let's see. Plus eight to hit and it does a 1d8 plus three forged damage.
Dungeon Master 01:29:39 1d8 is pretty good. Plus proficiency bonus. Yeah, I like that. You are spending some time. I think you'll need a little bit longer to make it truly effective, but you find a way to sort of change the actuators and the ratio of all the gears. You take sort of the really intricate, fancy gear work design of splitting up the work.
Dungeon Master 01:30:09 and you put it in like specific spots of the joints and the great thing about your still defender is like it is a piece of you that like you can eject so it's something you can make permanent if you work on it long enough um but uh a little bit longer but we'll say the first step will be it adds your proficiency bonus plus like decks at first so it'll be like a plus one on that on top of that so it'd be the eight plus
Dungeon Master 01:30:36 4. And then if you keep putting work into it, we can change it to strength, which is a little bit better. And we'll keep going up from there, where you sort of, as you improve on the design, it changes the associated stats. No, the same thing I'm doing with everybody. First one was free, so you just start making your headway on that.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:37 Okay. Cool. All right. Yeah, that's awesome. Do you want me to give a roll for that?
Dungeon Master 01:31:03 But it sounds like you guys want to do a little bit of a long haul. Next sort of part of the day, unless somebody wants to do anything specific. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:31:18 Can I spend a little time in the morning reading about charming items?
Dungeon Master 01:31:28 Yeah, that's pretty easy to like seek out because there's a whole school of magic for enchantment.
Dungeon Master 01:31:39 And so you just sort of start reading about the different fundamental school of wizardry, just like a different focus than your own. And you get down the basics, you find some stuff that explains how to enchant, effort, equivalent power levels, or what is the spell level. You find all that information and you start, as you are very good and adept at studying, you sort of just shift it to a different focus for a little bit.
Dungeon Master 01:32:09 So you can start on that as well. Awesome, awesome. Okay. And then go ahead and roll me a D6 for the next part of the day. You were up to a three-inch arm.
Kaladen Shash 01:32:13 Great. Three inch arm, yes. Slow down that growth. Something's wrong with the dice. Something's wrong with these dice.
Dungeon Master 01:32:38 No fucking way. It's long enough that it kind of has a little bit of a bend partway through, like it's developing its elbow. And it's thicker now. It's more than just a little sapling.
Leopold Magnus 01:32:42 Oh, man.
Kaladen Shash 01:32:44 Does not matter. Four of those in a row. Cool.
Dungeon Master 01:32:59 Got like some whip to it. The hands got a little more definition. The fingers are each just little leaves, but there are you have five of them now. But. Yeah. That's really, really, really funny. And then. Just back and forth. Everybody.
Leopold Magnus 01:33:17 Well, uh, Megalodon, I'm not quite sure here, and I kind of meringue it a bit.
Kaladen Shash 01:33:28 His potion made it sound like he would be very quick. I feel...
Dungeon Master 01:33:32 a perception check as you're sort of making your way through this day. And then since it's sort of the end of the next block, unless anybody's changing focus, go ahead and give me another animal handling check to see how much more progress you make on training. 14.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:54 All right. And then is this going to be with just straight? Well, not necessarily. I think last time you said since I was taking a significant amount of time. OK.
Dungeon Master 01:34:02 Just straight? What do you mean? Do you normally have other bonuses? Oh, for the animal handling. Sorry. I meant for the perception. Your animal handling will be at advantage. But I was thinking of the perception check first. 30, 20, 15.
Zariel Torgan 01:34:23 Oh, gotcha. Okay, well then I'll do that later. And dirty 20 for the perception.
Dungeon Master 01:34:33 Leopold, what do you have on your perception? 12. You don't hear anything. We'll say that makes sense with where you are at physically working on something in the little shop. You're sort of removed. And then Kaladin being very focused in learning. He's got his heads down in the books. And he's not really focusing. He maybe sometimes hears something without a whole lot.
Leopold Magnus 01:34:37 Perception Wealth
Dungeon Master 01:35:03 Zario, you're sort of up and about, getting treats a lot, taking food from the cafeteria as you're like moving throughout your day, and you're very much just in the omen night hall, so you're hearing a little bit. And you see two of them are training and chatting, and you hear sort of broken up language, but it's just like, you know, a scatter talk, and then, yeah, I mean, I heard he took a leave of absence this morning. And somebody else goes, I mean, I don't know what we're going to do without him. Fucking crazy, who knew?
Dungeon Master 01:35:32 And then somebody else, as they're like talking with somebody at the food bar, goes, yeah, I mean, I heard like somebody came after his family. He's taking an absence because he lost loved ones and he's gone out. But you're putting together a lot of stuff happened, but you don't.
Kaladen Shash 01:35:50 But.
Dungeon Master 01:35:52 hear about it right away. And then towards the end of the day, so it's been quite a bit, um, you two people just having a full conversation about it. And it's like very clear where it's just like, yeah, they're like, I mean, I don't think the Lord Marshall has missed a day, uh, ever in his career from what they say. And he's temporarily taking a spot out. I mean, it's kind of weird. Don't you think not to have them just around?
Dungeon Master 01:36:20 I hope everything's good. And that's sort of what you get as you're making your way through your day, training the pups here and there, eating, just kind of hanging around. And then that'll be the end of the second day, unless you guys want to do something. So Cowden can give me another D6 roll. One and six.
Kaladen Shash 01:36:39 Alright, here we go. No promises. Pretty pretty slim, but there's broken is broken. It's broken fair. That's 54545. I've been around. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:36:41 Come on, big money. What are the odds? Holy Jesus. Isn't that like six to the power of five that that happens? Statistically speaking.
Leopold Magnus 01:36:51 Dude the odds of that how many d6s have you rolled? Five d6s and they're all came up on one
Dungeon Master 01:37:00 That was the fifth. They're technically each their own secret role, but I mean in the grand scheme of things, that's fucking unlikely as hell.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:12 That's so funny.
Dungeon Master 01:37:21 Yeah, yeah, I mean, I want to give you more, but that's. I can't do anything with Lauren. Yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:37:27 That's a one in 7,776 chance. So you're pretty lucky, I guess.
Kaladen Shash 01:37:36 Excellent. It's going to be so strong.
Zariel Torgan 01:37:41 Oh man. Did I need to roll another time for the animal handling? Because I rolled a 17. It's worse.
Dungeon Master 01:37:53 No, no. 21 is really good. So unless you can, I mean, you have advantage. So did you roll the other one?
Dungeon Master 01:38:06 We'll take the 21. You get them to not master, but like they really have down, like sit and stay. And when I say like not master, I don't mean like you, you have to do more work. It's just like, as they get older, they'll get really good at it. But like that is a command that you don't have to keep repeating.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:30 Gotcha. Sweet. Did anybody talk to our boss? About.
Leopold Magnus 01:38:43 So we're sticking around, I might work on this guy a little more. Can I roll for that? All right.
Dungeon Master 01:38:44 Okay. Yeah, go for it. You guys have not yet.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:59 Did we want to do that first thing or? Okay. I think it's later.
Kaladen Shash 01:39:04 We could speak to her today. Let's go. Leora, what's her name? What's her name? Leora.
Dungeon Master 01:39:14 Laura. That'd be much harder.
Leopold Magnus 01:39:25 Jonathan, if I work on this, can I maybe get it to imbue a little bit of magic? Like, for instance, cast a cantrip as an action rather than attack with the sword? Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:39:44 in that you'd have to learn how to enchant as well. It's something you can do with time, but like enchaining as its own thing is sort of like a wizard niche. And so giving it to another class, I'm going to have to put some work into that, but it is possible.
Leopold Magnus 01:40:01 Yeah, that's what I'll work on. I'm going to work on enchanting my Steel Defender to be able to cast Fireball. Does that seem reasonable? Yes, that's a spell I have.
Dungeon Master 01:40:14 And you can cast Firebolt, correct? Great. Makes it a little more easy, so we'll just divide it as like, you take one of the smaller power cores out of the...
Dungeon Master 01:40:28 Blackguard robot and you sort of imbue it into the center of the Steel Defender when it deploys. And how you'd make it different is you can enchant in basics as like you were casting a spell repeatedly into something to hold that spell eventually, like the repetition is what actually gives it the magic. So you'll start in the process of just
Kaladen Shash 01:40:52 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:40:53 imbuing Firebolt energy that dispels itself into the gem like the Power Stone which can then be shot by the Steel Defender. Cool. So no check needed because you can cast it. It just takes time.
Leopold Magnus 01:41:02 Yeah, I'll work on that for the next few times. So I guess would that be an Arcana check or? OK. Got it.
Dungeon Master 01:41:21 And then we didn't do it last night, but I guess we'll do it this night. Zariel, it is a rare event, but you feel the pull as like the extended full moon hits its absolute
Dungeon Master 01:41:39 Apex in its position in the night and its position on the tilt of the globe, and you feel this immense draw. Go ahead and give me a wisdom-saving throw to resist this transformation.
Kaladen Shash 01:42:00 you.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:04 Yeah, I did forget to do anything about that, so that's on me. 24?
Dungeon Master 01:42:11 Four is so good. You feel the strong urge in your body to sort of just tear away at your metal chest, your, you know, or like nano-organic sort of form that's really cool in design. You feel like you want to tear it away and reveal something underneath, but you're like cold sweating in the workshop, biting it off. And you find that in this night you
Dungeon Master 01:42:40 like with active intent, hold off on an uncontrolled transformation. And you guys got all sleep on your second day, start of the third day. Unless you want to go talk to Leora, you sort of just bypass that, too. But then if not, count and roll, roll to D6. Maybe the one is.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:04 You get two sixes. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 01:43:06 Yeah. Hot, hot dice. Here we go. Two. That's better. There's no ones.
Dungeon Master 01:43:14 Two sixes, let's go. Nice. It's up to a foot total in length. So this is actually a pretty significant growth in that the base of this artificial organic arm is now the full diameter and circumference
Leopold Magnus 01:43:22 Next.
Dungeon Master 01:43:42 in all shape it fully matches up of what your arm was so it transitions a very clean line from flesh to sort of hardened but fluid wood shape that's got this green energy flowing through it and it's almost full length his hands like a his full arm is a hand's length short at this point like it's really close but it's not quite there um and as it gets closer to the hand it's a little thinner than it should be but you see
Dungeon Master 01:44:09 this fully prehensile, fully functioning artificial version of his normal arm.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:24 Sweet. We want to see how much time we have left, or if they're waiting on us, did we want to do that today?
Kaladen Shash 01:44:24 Excellent. It's a grower, not a storer. It's getting there, okay? Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:29 Sounds good.
Dungeon Master 01:44:45 You guys would know with the way that she had phrased it, it was sort of come back when you were ready.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:53 So what do you guys think? Finish up until at least your arm is good, all the way done, and then head back? All right, then yeah, I'll do another... Oh, go ahead.
Kaladen Shash 01:44:57 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Jonathan, you can go ahead. Would I be able to start trying to, after having studied some stuff, would I be able to try to start enchanting a ring of holding?
Dungeon Master 01:45:21 I'm going to say you have to start a little bit lower than that. It's like your first enchanting thing. Yeah, because that would be the equivalent of just casting shield repeatedly. So if you know you're going to have a down day, you can just blow all of your spell slots into repeatedly casting shield. And that'll be a pretty good jump start to that.
Kaladen Shash 01:45:27 Let's have a, how about a, how about a ring of protection? Okay. Okay. Done.
Dungeon Master 01:45:59 Anything else with your third day? Okay, what's your next command set?
Zariel Torgan 01:46:02 I just want to train some puppies. Follow, I guess, or do they already innately just follow me?
Kaladen Shash 01:46:04 I'll use all my...
Dungeon Master 01:46:17 They innately do it, but it's not clean. It's very messy, uneven, back and forth lines. It's not a trained skill. It seems more instinct, so it's not perfect. So you could definitely hone it.
Zariel Torgan 01:46:33 I'd like to practice them following me. And then also them hiding behind stuff. So like, like, go hide, you know, so they can like not get immediately murdered the moment we take them somewhere.
Dungeon Master 01:46:51 OK, yeah, you'll start on the fundamentals of that again. Sort of the initial training sequences and the hard to do, because it's sort of introduction. Introducing a skill so there's no need to roll for it, but you get the process started for the new set of commands.
Zariel Torgan 01:47:07 Please.
Leopold Magnus 01:47:19 I'm just going to keep focusing on the fireball for the steel defender.
Dungeon Master 01:47:25 Okay. You're sort of enhancing your knowledge, figuring out how to better enchant and have it hold, and the purpose of intent in the process as well. It's not all about innate skill, and so you're learning about how to force your will into the object to hold the enchantment. That takes some time, but you make some more progress. Go ahead and give me an Arcana check.
Zariel Torgan 01:47:52 I see.
Leopold Magnus 01:47:58 18.
Dungeon Master 01:48:00 Okay, good start. I'm going to say for the first level of the Enchant, it's not perfect yet, but you managed to get your Steel Defender to hold 1d3 charges, minimum of one, obviously, of Firebolt that you roll for now. So give me a d4 minus one. Two.
Kaladen Shash 01:48:17 Well.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:28 Nice, so one charge. OK, cool. So how do I make note of that? I guess I'll just have to remember.
Dungeon Master 01:48:30 But yeah, you get a firebolt out of your Steel Defender a day, which can obviously, you can, you learn that with this form of like arcane energy, instead of just like your innate skill through your tinkering, can be improved on. So you can increase this with time.
Dungeon Master 01:48:56 Yeah, and also I can link. There's like documents on enchanting rules and how to make it work. So I can I can get some stuff on that. I can make it one. I just haven't done it. If you'd like, I could do that.
Leopold Magnus 01:49:04 Okay. Maybe later, but is there a way we can add like familiar, which is just the steel defender? Okay, yeah, no rush, but that'd be pretty sweet. Keep track of and then I can. Yeah. Because I got to remember the plus one on the force damage.
Dungeon Master 01:49:28 Mm-hmm. Yeah. No worries. Okay. We'll have Kaladin also make your final, hopefully your final D6 roll.
Kaladen Shash 01:49:53 Just a single d6. Hot numbers. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:49:57 Now go ahead and do 2d6. There's only a certain amount left. 4. I'll call that good. At this point you see that the hand has finished growing.
Kaladen Shash 01:50:29 Very good, I have like full control of it and everything. Excellent. And. Do you want me to roll anything for the? Bring a protection.
Dungeon Master 01:50:33 Functions fully as your hand and arm, honestly. But, um. Does exactly as you wanted to. Uh. How much spell slots did you give into it?
Kaladen Shash 01:51:00 If we're doing nothing today, I'll I'll dump all of them. Just casting yield. Seven.
Dungeon Master 01:51:04 Which is how many? Seven. That's a pretty good number. And this was for your ring. It is not done yet, but at this stage, if you sort of sealed off the arcane runes, it would be a plus one to...
Dungeon Master 01:51:27 armor class but it's not at the plus one to saving throw so it's really it's close to being finished but it's not quite there and that'll give you
Kaladen Shash 01:51:35 Throughout the day, could I have short rested and use my arcane recovery? And I can. I think it gives me at least two more level ones. Let me see. Yeah. OK, cool.
Dungeon Master 01:51:51 I'll say that's not quite enough to do a big difference in what the effect is, but it's halfway finished. What's next, guys?
Kaladen Shash 01:52:07 Put it in my pocket, keep working. My arm is breaking, so should we go speak with the commanding officer?
Zariel Torgan 01:52:23 Um, if the... Yeah, I think I would have mentioned what I had heard about our higher-up being Atakamish. Maybe that way everybody knows, because wasn't... wasn't he supposed to be who we were going to meet up with?
Dungeon Master 01:52:50 No, you heard that Captain Levi was going to be the person you talk to next. As a Captain Levi was pretty instrumental in the first organization. People are just talking about like the sudden leave of absence of the Lord Marshal.
Zariel Torgan 01:52:55 Oh, yeah, gotcha. I'm gonna make a wild theory. I'm just gonna throw it out. Is that okay? I think that the Lord Marshal is the boy dog. And we just killed his wife.
Kaladen Shash 01:53:09 Right here. OK. OK.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:33 Just, I mean, like he just said that he lost a family member and you know, didn't he like disappear in a weird way when we opened that portal to the outside?
Leopold Magnus 01:53:47 I don't think so. I think he was inside the dome, wasn't he? Oh, that's a good point. I think that was, that was Levi.
Kaladen Shash 01:53:47 I don't remember that specifically. Was it Captain Levi that was with us or Lord Marshall that was with us whenever we shut the? The arc door. Yeah. Right, he was with us. I like where that was going.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:03 Yeah. Oh, OK. All right. Well, maybe not. Maybe not. Or maybe. OK. Well, anyway. Yeah. Yeah. I forgot to fix it. And I don't know that we have any money to fix it.
Dungeon Master 01:54:04 It was the Lord Marked All.
Leopold Magnus 01:54:16 I mean, he may be infected, but I guess also, Zaryel, did you end up contracting lycanthropy?
Zariel Torgan 01:54:34 Yeah, maybe it'll be cool.
Dungeon Master 01:54:35 You do much harder when you've had the first transformation. You fought it off, but you definitely were about to. It was only because you rolled a 24 that you didn't. So you definitely know that it would be harder at this point, but maybe not as hard as... It's not the hardest thing in the world. It is just very time-consuming and can be challenging.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:03 Yeah. Would I know, practically speaking, how it would affect me if I just waited until the next full moon just to get whatever we're working on done?
Kaladen Shash 01:55:06 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:55:19 I mean, nothing beyond that you know it'd just be harder. You don't know how, but you just know it is.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:28 So what do you guys think? You think I should take a couple days and get worked on or just deal with it later?
Kaladen Shash 01:55:42 to take care of it now if you can, like it's now simple, now easy.
Leopold Magnus 01:55:45 Yeah, you might want to get that taken a look at.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:53 Could I say that in between doing some training, maybe I sussed out where I would need to go to get the help that I would need?
Dungeon Master 01:56:06 Yeah, because you did the least, so you could have had time to do it. You talk with Leora. Yeah, you talk to Leora, who is inflicted with lycanthropy. And she explains that, like, at this option, it would be pricier, probably a little bit harder than it normally would.
Kaladen Shash 01:56:11 You can have, I have 40 gold you can have.
Dungeon Master 01:56:29 but that like in theory, a greater restoration spell could do it like with a little bit extra juice, just like maybe two castings of it instead of one. Like it could happen. Um, and that you would just need to be able to find somebody who could cast that. Um, and then likely would need to pay for the material components. And she happens to know what it is because she had done research into it before. Um, one casting of greater restoration requires a hundred gold pieces worth of diamond dust.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:52 Let's see what I got. If I have anything else worth anything. So I got 40 gold. Is there a pawn shop?
Kaladen Shash 01:57:05 A 40 goal you can have. Does our guy barter? The one does the weapons upgrades as he buys things? Question. Correct.
Dungeon Master 01:57:22 Presumably. Not that you know. Didn't seem like it. I need to figure out what his name was. I'm not sure.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:25 Can I go to the weapons guy? Talk to him? It was really, really nice guy.
Kaladen Shash 01:57:50 So understanding.
Zariel Torgan 01:57:53 Yeah, so willing to do what I want him to do in this instance.
Dungeon Master 01:58:02 Where is it at?
Dungeon Master 01:58:19 Anyway, though, I could talk as I try to find his name. He explains that it's not not really what he does. He doesn't buy anything. He just offers his like enough to pay off his all those bills and stuff by making these enhancements. It's like that's what he does for the Omen Knights. So he's not he's not your guy for that.
Kaladen Shash 01:58:38 Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:58:42 Is there a bank? Is there like a pension for the Omen Knights or some sort of legionnaire savings or checking? Alright, I'll just go talk. I just want to borrow some money so I can pay to get this fixed.
Dungeon Master 01:58:54 No. What are you looking for? You don't think it's, like you know it's going to cost that much probably for a while, like it won't increase drastically, so you have 30-ish days to deal with it. You guys have been
Kaladen Shash 01:59:19 Oh, OK. Yeah. Excellent.
Zariel Torgan 01:59:20 Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. And a later. Yeah, I could make. Yeah, yeah, I'll make that money in no time. Yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll do it later. So we can just, we can get on with what we were thinking about doing. I'll be fine. I'll be fine.
Dungeon Master 01:59:21 You guys have, because it was a full moon that night and it's about a month between each full moon. Do you guys, you have that many more days before it's a problem. And you guys have only been, you guys have only been soldiers probably about a month.
Kaladen Shash 01:59:49 It'll go away, right? It's gone. Let's go to Levi.
Zariel Torgan 01:59:51 Yeah, that's how we handle things. Hope they don't. So yeah, are we going to talk to Levi then? Sweet, let's do it.
Leopold Magnus 01:59:55 Oh, I'm sure it won't be a problem.
Dungeon Master 02:00:09 All righty. You guys make your way. I've got it somewhere.
Dungeon Master 02:00:38 You make your way to Levi's office, sort of that meeting room. You see him, as always, sort of ever-working. He's got, like, his arcane bolts, bolt throwers, his little handheld ones, sort of just on his desk, sort of laid out. Maybe he didn't want it on his hip. Going through some different parchments and scrolls. Looking at it, he sees you guys walk in.
Dungeon Master 02:01:06 gives you a quick nod, looking down, and then as he's sort of just looking down at these papers, he acknowledges you guys, he goes, Phyllis, how can I help you on this fine afternoon? Hold on, I'll speak at once.
Kaladen Shash 02:01:24 Yes. Yes, hello, Captain Levi. We've come back. We're just checking in. Also recently finished a mission where we defeated a very large Lycan. Very well done.
Dungeon Master 02:01:39 Right, right, right, right. Oh, shit, sorry. Forgot that you guys were up for that, if I'm being honest. I heard you guys, sorry, congrats. A little scattered now. And looking at him, you see he does look tired, in the same way that the Lord Marshal had been looking tired after having a lot of very stressful times at once, like it just sort of, the extra duties we're wearing on him. Captain Levi, you could assume, probably took on some extra
Dungeon Master 02:02:09 responsibilities and daily duties when the Lord Marshal is apparently no longer around for the time being. So he looks very, a little worn out, a little scatterbrained. And he goes, yeah, I guess this is the big one. Before we get too into the details, I just need to be very upfront. Please have a seat. And he motions for the chairs. And he sits back, kicks his feet up. He goes,
Kaladen Shash 02:02:14 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:02:36 I don't wanna just waste my breath on this, but if offered the opportunity, would you guys, the three of you, be willing to head out on an expedition to the North Dome?
Kaladen Shash 02:02:56 Peace.
Leopold Magnus 02:02:58 Well, I suppose that would be of interest to me.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:01 Yeah, that sounds good.
Dungeon Master 02:03:04 Uh, it is, uh, well, okay, let's fucking, let's talk about it. Uh, uh, he goes, uh, so where to start first and foremost, the, the core will do what it can to supply you with things that we anticipate you will need.
Dungeon Master 02:03:27 uh it will be an expedition variable in time we anticipate at least a couple weeks at the very shortest um a couple factors play into that but it could be as long as a couple months maybe never you i don't know when you're returning um here's how this works we made a big show of it for the
Dungeon Master 02:03:50 the gathering, but it doesn't really have to be that way. Once we open up the dome, we activate the Arcane Splitter, secure an area outside of there. Don't anticipate there'll be the same issue again with you guys taking care of the cult.
Dungeon Master 02:04:07 But we've got some mages who have been trained. It's difficult with very few remaining people ever having been to the dome itself that are still alive. There are a couple, but not many. Teleportation there is very limited.
Dungeon Master 02:04:26 So what we'll have to happen is they'll attempt to teleport you to a dome. We know they won't get very far, that kind of power isn't in our grasp at this moment for such a far distance, but we'll get you as close as we can. From there, with your supplies, you will make your way to the northern dome through various scrying.
Dungeon Master 02:04:49 capabilities we have mapped out it as the following and you see he pulls up his like arcane wall sort of rises up and he starts showing you and he goes this is a general map that's been generated with what we've seen most recently and it is and this is where we will help you best we can
Zariel Torgan 02:04:52 you
Dungeon Master 02:05:17 We know Moonhaven is fairly overgrown with vegetation, dense forests took from the area around. But whatever happened with the dome collapsing, we didn't know this until very recently.
Dungeon Master 02:05:31 There's some weird magic going on there at this point. The water seems to be drawn into the dome itself inexplicably. We don't know if this is part of why we lost communication or something happened but that dome is shattered and that is mostly filled with water so you'll get
Dungeon Master 02:05:51 What we can spare as far as water breathing potions and syringes, you'll get some extra healing syringes. The mission will be pretty simple as follows. We send you in. You make your way in. You identify, in this case, for this first one, what is bringing the water in. If you have the capability to neutralize it, reverse it, do that, and then find a way back.
Dungeon Master 02:06:19 We know that there is old teleportation circles in Moonhaven. If you can activate them, that'll be an easy trip back. But if you can't make your way back south, when you are in range, we might be able to teleport you back. Questions about the basic premise of this?
Dungeon Master 02:06:47 Eyes flick from one to the other. He switches his projection and his map.
Kaladen Shash 02:06:48 I'll do here. Will it be within one day, two days of the dome? Like how close do you feel like we'll teleport to the dome?
Dungeon Master 02:07:05 goes, if I'm being completely frank with you, I think you might be, uh, pulls up a map of everything. This is just for you guys more than anything. He goes, I don't think we'll get you out of the planes of fate realistically, but, um, there's a chance that we teleport you into the forest, maybe closer to the desert. It's, it's, it's really tough to say, but you, you won't be that close now.
Kaladen Shash 02:07:37 but it's going to take some time to get that disorder into healing.
Dungeon Master 02:07:42 Absolutely. That is why this was not handed out right away.
Leopold Magnus 02:07:58 Do we have any data on the Moonhaven Dome? You know, historic records and whatnot?
Zariel Torgan 02:07:59 Yep.
Dungeon Master 02:08:05 It depends on what you're looking for. I guess some stuff I wouldn't know if it's classified. It'd be out of my reach. But basic information, culture, structure, things like that. We lost contact a little while back, but only recently did it come into public's knowledge.
Dungeon Master 02:08:24 Certain goods ran out and we couldn't keep lying anymore, but Moonhaven had been through a lot with the Aesoptric War, so it's it makes it honestly it was surprising it lasted as long as it did seeing as the East Dome fell first.
Leopold Magnus 02:08:45 OK, indeed. Yes, maybe I can find some records for reference, but that is helpful to know.
Dungeon Master 02:08:53 Yeah, um, well anyway, still looking back and forth to each of you. Questions?
Kaladen Shash 02:09:07 I'm wondering the supplies you've named, is there any other purpose to the mission, or just trying to go figure out why it happened?
Dungeon Master 02:09:16 Bare minimum, I want you to figure out why this happens. You guys have really surprised all of us before. You can fix the problem, at least to some extent. Do it on your way out, but this is not a sacrifice your lives kind of mission.
Kaladen Shash 02:09:49 um distance if you relocate so far
Zariel Torgan 02:09:49 Are we going to have a means of communicating? Does our armor have upgraded stuff for this?
Dungeon Master 02:10:01 Not to their gnome, unfortunately, sorry. The core is limited in power outside of the dome as the magic is sort of abjured by the nature of the dome itself. We'll have some contact, like, for example, if the teleportation was really unbeneficial and you only landed a few miles north of here, we'll probably have the ability to talk with you.
Dungeon Master 02:10:30 We've made some modifications since you guys went dark previously Figured out some things but it's not impressive to that extent There's just there's a lot riding on you guys. But at the same time nobody will know when you're gone because this will not be This won't be publicized this time. This is you guys will be heroes if you make it and you'll be names lost to history if you don't
Zariel Torgan 02:11:04 Yeah, well, I'm ready to rock if you guys are. I don't know if there's any other questions you have. I'm kind of excited to hit the road. Yeah, what did we get specifically?
Kaladen Shash 02:11:12 Now let's get started. How many, Jonathan, just for the sake of saying inventory before we start teleporting, what do we have as far as healing syringes?
Dungeon Master 02:11:32 And he takes you to a separate room, and he goes, all right. Pulls up some different drawers, opens them, sets them on top of counters. He goes, from what we can offer and what we anticipate you will need, you will get a handful of these lesser healing syringes, a couple of the larger ones, and we'll give you one large one for a big boost. Each of you will get two of these water breathing syringes. They activate for 24 hours.
Dungeon Master 02:11:57 So with first use, the dome was large. But even if 50% of that dome is underwater, that's more than enough time to make your way through. And then some of you, he looks at. Honestly, he looks at you, Zahra, now. Well, we brushed over the fact that he doesn't know that you've changed. And he goes, most of you don't know that you necessarily need to breathe.
Dungeon Master 02:12:27 So the allocation is still the same. Kaladin, you'll still need them, I think, but it'll be six for this party. So and then count on each of you getting four of these minor syringes. You each get one of these more potent ones. And one of you, whoever's the most trustworthy, hold on to this larger syringe.
Kaladen Shash 02:12:28 Mm-hmm.
Zariel Torgan 02:12:29 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:13:01 And in translation, you each get 4 regular healing potions, so the 2d4 plus 2. You each get 1 greater healing potion, 4d4 plus 4. And one of you gets a superior, which is 8d4 plus 8.
Kaladen Shash 02:13:08 Yep. Yeah, you. Your tank you go through your forms and then you've got nothing left. For sure.
Leopold Magnus 02:13:23 to a
Zariel Torgan 02:13:27 You guys think? All right, yeah, I'll throw it on there. So that's... What? Go wrong. That's just bad gameplay.
Dungeon Master 02:13:37 Oh yeah, give the guy who's got like 300 base HP extra healing. Because you guys hide.
Leopold Magnus 02:13:54 I just can't be hit, so other people get hit for me. Oh, so that's probably higher than me.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:58 Yeah. Yeah, sweet. I got one. Mine is insane. It's a base 20. And then if we're fighting anything that's considered like large or giant, I get an additional one. And then if I can convince the shield I've fought before, I think I get another one or I get something. I have to double check that. Yeah. So I think like,
Kaladen Shash 02:13:59 What's your armor cost, Jim?
Dungeon Master 02:14:19 Yes, you get another one. He can get to 22, no problem, pretty much. You guys understand that's not normal. I mean, for a whole party, 21, 22, potentially an 18.
Zariel Torgan 02:14:28 Yeah, 22 is pretty much it. No, that's insane.
Leopold Magnus 02:14:35 Sorry, Jonathan, that was, yeah, me 21 and him 22. So, sorry, it was two minors and then two graders. Four regular.
Kaladen Shash 02:14:48 No, it's saying 17. Oh, maybe I'm on a tune to the armor again. No, there it is. Yeah, I don't know why it says armor class 14 now. It said 15 earlier. Now I'm at 17.
Dungeon Master 02:14:59 four minors or four regulars, one greater, and then somebody gets a superior. Interesting. We can figure that out.
Leopold Magnus 02:15:05 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:15:18 Yeah, nothing else changed. Well. Well, there we go. It's unattuned for some reason. All set still.
Dungeon Master 02:15:45 Nice, cool. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:15:46 Hmm. All right. Yeah, I think I'm ready to rock if you guys are. Yeah. Somewhere indeed. Who's going to roll? Or is you rolling, Jonathan?
Kaladen Shash 02:15:56 Yes, let us go. Let us teleport to somewhere. Unless you want me to roll a one, don't ask. I'm not going to do it.
Dungeon Master 02:16:14 If you guys are just kind of getting to it, nothing else do you want to do? Um, you all, um, they say like me, the next meetup will be the following dawn, um, early hours to avoid, um, a lot of people seeing the arcane splitter reactivated. You guys make your way and then, um, pure luck check. Somebody go enroll me at D 20.
Zariel Torgan 02:16:45 I can do it. Three. Low is good, right? Ow.
Kaladen Shash 02:16:47 gives it.
Dungeon Master 02:16:56 three. Okay. I was just saying, if you guys got like real, real high roll, something really cool would happen, but the standard stuff will happen. You guys make your way to through the market district, they open up
Dungeon Master 02:17:09 With everything you see these mages in like very basic blue-gray cloaks and robing sort of have their like wristband spell books opened up and they're filtering and they're chanting and you see these arcane runes glow around your whole group as you guys sort of brace and then we'll do the teleportation rules. Somebody give me that D100. One person.
Zariel Torgan 02:17:39 What do you think, Leo? Think it's your turn? Big money. 99. Do 100. Nice. We land in the dome.
Leopold Magnus 02:17:42 Okay, I can do it d20 Oh Is it a d100 or did you say that it's a 20 right? Oh it is 100. Oh, I missed it 84
Kaladen Shash 02:17:43 Yes. Yes, there. It's just over. You want to 100? Yeah, we're there are there. Flash.
Dungeon Master 02:18:06 Hey Uh 84 okay, um Let's see if I have a general map to put you guys somewhere
Zariel Torgan 02:18:16 Hold your breath.
Dungeon Master 02:18:49 I like this one.
Dungeon Master 02:18:53 Okay, you guys, you hear the magic sort of starting just, as you guys feel your body start to feel like that stretching sensation, and this magic sort of rises like dust off the ground. As your body physically feel like they're stretching, you are shunted, almost feels like through the air. It's faster than the speed of light, and you can't even process, but you can feel it in your body before you guys land. Feet down, maybe stumble a little bit to dirt,
Kaladen Shash 02:18:54 Fly you is gone.
Dungeon Master 02:19:24 uh billows out from underneath and spreads outward as you guys make instant contact um in this little well-worn animal path trail where you're at you don't really know but i think the first thing that would make sense to let you know that it was a pretty good roll with how far you got um you try to check in on your comm system and it's dead silence you don't get anything from the course you are beyond a few miles at the bare minimum
Kaladen Shash 02:19:54 Okay, we're still alive. From where we are, can we see the dome?
Zariel Torgan 02:19:57 Sweet. That went pretty well. Good question.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:11 Well, shall we proceed?
Dungeon Master 02:20:24 No, you cannot from where you are at. Yeah, I said it's early hours. We'll stick with classic sun rules. Give me just a survival check as you sort of check the positioning.
Zariel Torgan 02:20:30 Can I make a check to just get our bearings to start heading what we think is the right direction based on the light to get a good cardinal direction? That's a four, so 11. Oh, great.
Dungeon Master 02:20:57 11. That's not horrible, but I'll say like, it's just with that, I'll put your placement a little bit trickier. You see that the sun seems to be sort of rising from your general east-ish direction that you can gather. You do a couple different things to try to figure out that it's not just like time of year, things like that. Again,
Dungeon Master 02:21:20 The first time you guys had ever been out of the dome was very recently so you're still trying to put together it You're not like an expert at this But you gather that you are general positioning Maybe somewhere pretty far north and that
Kaladen Shash 02:21:33 Bye.
Dungeon Master 02:21:45 It'd be kind of a 50. Well, actually, no, I'm going to say that one's not good enough. Where you are, it's not anything that you guys do wrong, necessarily, but there's too dense of tree cover in the general area. You don't see any, like, really defining landmarks that you would know of.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:04 Gotcha. OK. Do we want to just start moseying?
Kaladen Shash 02:22:15 Yes, and the whole team is just us, correct? No one else is with us as we teleported. Yes, let us proceed in a general direction. Are we just wandering in a northward direction, assuming that we've not landed quite far enough?
Dungeon Master 02:22:18 That's it, just you guys. Yeah, which direction are you going?
Zariel Torgan 02:22:31 Yeah, let's do it. I guess we'll just start cooking. Sorry, just start moving. Yeah, I figured I didn't get a great sense with the check, but I still know roughly, like, you know, I figure we'll go that way for a while until I get another opportunity to make another check to get a better idea of where we are.
Zariel Torgan 02:23:06 Unless somebody else has a different idea. All right, sweet, yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:23:06 Okay.
Kaladen Shash 02:23:13 No, let's go.
Leopold Magnus 02:23:13 That's something about right, yeah. Gallatin
Dungeon Master 02:23:27 Okay. You guys had in a North for direction. Um, you get a better sense of your bearings. I'll throw you guys on the big map again. Um, you find that I let your little guys to the movie. You are moving and with time you discover that you are,
Dungeon Master 02:23:56 at like the very edge of the plains that the South Dome is based in, you come to like a clearing and you see that Drake's Roost Mountain is at your northeast. You just couldn't really see it when you were in the tree line, but you sort of see where it is now and you eventually start hearing what sounds like faintly
Dungeon Master 02:24:20 like water rushing and you're like okay the mountains there that must be the sort of river or you know pathway um ends it doesn't go straight through um doesn't flow super fast from whatever you've read in your like debrief but you get the sense that you are pretty far
Dungeon Master 02:24:45 still have to go, depending on your pathway, through either the mountains path, straight through the Chiari Forest, or up and around through Paradise Lamasta Desert. That's sort of up to you guys.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:04 What do you guys think? My gut says forest. Just seems like the most direct route, but I'm cool with whatever. Yeah, absolutely.
Kaladen Shash 02:25:16 I like most direct. I like direct.
Leopold Magnus 02:25:16 Yeah, I think. Yeah, I suppose there's also potentially more danger in the forest, so we'll have to be more aware, but. It was there faster.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:39 Sweet. Yeah, so I guess we'll start heading towards the desert.
Dungeon Master 02:25:40 OK. I'll put you on this map just as you make your way. You'll eventually meet something like that. But go ahead and give me a couple checks, the first one being the most important, the more fun. Somebody give me an encounter check. As you guys are making your way, it'll be a couple hours trip as you're navigating through the landscape. But also give me just a general check for weather.
Dungeon Master 02:26:10 As you guys, again, have never been out in the elements like this, but it's a pretty nice day to start with when you teleport. You hear distant birds singing. There's a light breeze. We'll see if the weather changes on you guys. Oh, man.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:25 Hey, Kaladin, you've been pretty hot. Why don't you do the encounter? Mmm, pretty good. What do you think, Leo? You or me?
Kaladen Shash 02:26:33 Let me show you what I've got. Seven.
Dungeon Master 02:26:41 Okay. I'll figure out what to do with that, guys. Somebody give me a weather check so it'll be straight D20.
Leopold Magnus 02:26:58 Or straight d20 If you want it you could take it otherwise, I'll roll Okay, oh Good luck 19, baby
Zariel Torgan 02:27:00 Yeah. All right, you go for it. Nice. Sunny skies.
Dungeon Master 02:27:16 Nice. The day is beautiful. Yeah. Sun beats down. You can tell from like, you again, a lot of this is just you're reading about you don't totally know. You've lived in a controlled weather area that's artificial to made seem very natural. But the from the weather, sorry, the warmth you feel on your skin, it's not overwhelming. So you're like, hey, it's not the middle of the summer. It's sort of
Kaladen Shash 02:27:16 Very good weather.
Dungeon Master 02:27:44 Crisp air, probably a full swing either mid-spring or early fall. Things are still growing, still dying because the weather's a little inconsistent, but you found it on a good day. It's warm temperature. It's not hot. It's not cold. It's very pleasant outside.
Kaladen Shash 02:27:52 Sounds like a lovely day for an encounter.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:08 Sweet. Yeah. How late were you guys wanting to play tonight? Because I feel like if we hit an encounter, it's probably going to push us into pretty late.
Dungeon Master 02:28:25 Let me just find something cool. We could do introduction, you know.
Leopold Magnus 02:28:40 Yeah, that's a good point. I don't know if I have a full encounter in me tonight, but maybe a little bit.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:50 Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying right now. I'm just saying, you know, because I do want to fight something cool. But yeah, at the very least, we could do some sort of introduction or something. Yeah.
Kaladen Shash 02:28:52 First blood.
Dungeon Master 02:29:11 I had to find something. I didn't have a low roll. I wanted something cool to fight. As you guys are making your way though, what do you want to talk about? Pass some time. Also give me a moment, you know?
Kaladen Shash 02:29:33 How's my arm looking? Is it feeling in more? How's it look? It's getting thicker, very good.
Zariel Torgan 02:29:35 I was just gonna ask, I was just gonna ask if it's just continuing to grow.
Dungeon Master 02:29:41 It seems, yeah, it seems like it's normal. It probably won't grow a whole lot more, but it's still fully functional. It's got musculature defined, like your old RMAD. It doesn't feel, as you have it day in and day out, it's getting a little more comfortable.
Zariel Torgan 02:30:05 You count the rings, does it tell us how old he is? No, no, no. That's true, right? I could cut it off. Like a gecko. Or one of those lizards.
Kaladen Shash 02:30:10 I don't know. Yeah, we're doing. What's the what's yeah, right? Let go. What's the rules there? Regrowth on the prosthesis.
Dungeon Master 02:30:10 Do you cut it so that you can see him?
Leopold Magnus 02:30:16 the
Dungeon Master 02:30:41 Potentially.
Zariel Torgan 02:30:43 That'd be a great interaction. We're fighting a boss and you just like, I can't go on and drop your arm and run. Just confuse him.
Leopold Magnus 02:30:54 Oh, Zario, um, what, uh, how's your new, um, you know, robot legs treating you?
Kaladen Shash 02:31:03 Because you still got a soul.
Zariel Torgan 02:31:04 Well, you know, technically it's always been these. I don't know, it's a bit of an adjustment. Not sure why I have a southern accent still, considering I'm a robot, but... You know, it's not all things that make sense. Yeah. Yeah, maybe this...
Leopold Magnus 02:31:27 Is suppose you always knew that you were a robot down there? Why yes indeed.
Zariel Torgan 02:31:33 No, no, no, I didn't always know, but I mean, technically it's been the same legs this whole time, just had skin on them. I'm not sure why the skin didn't grow back. Must be that at this point it's not necessary. Yeah, we can hang out and
Leopold Magnus 02:31:57 Well, at least I don't feel so alone these days.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:04 you know, grease each other and, you know, help each other out. I thought that was cute, yeah. Anyway, here's that adult white dragon.
Kaladen Shash 02:32:06 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:32:14 That was really cute, actually. Great conversation. Everything I'm finding is either really... No, you guys didn't really like that one. Everything is just really hard. I'm trying to filter through everything.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:39 Oh, we can handle it.
Dungeon Master 02:32:43 I don't want to do that. I want something... Like I said, I just got a bunch of new monsters that I have access to, so I'm just trying to find something random and cool.
Kaladen Shash 02:32:56 How does everybody feel after their level up? What did you all do? Fourth level, fourth level. Yeah, and a couple extra lower level spell slots. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:05 I didn't get anything other than more spells. I got access to 4th level. I was able to pick up Divination as a ritual. And then I got Fire Shield.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:26 which is 10 minutes. It's a shield that gives me resistance to either cold or ice damage, I mean, or fire damage, depending on which shield I choose. And then anybody that attacks me automatically takes 2d8 fire damage. So... Yeah, yeah. But since I'm... Yeah, but it's not a concentration, and it lasts 10 minutes, so I figure I could cast it before I go into
Kaladen Shash 02:33:36 Yep. Is that melee attack range? For anyone that attacks, OK. That's great, I didn't know that.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:57 a wild shape, and then it's just doing damage for the whole time I'm there, because it's not concentration, it just lasts. Yeah, and then I got Polymorph and Summon Elemental. Those are all the fourth level ones I grabbed. I've only got one slot, but I figured, you know, those are all pretty awesome, if the time is right, if I just save it. So, and then yeah, just other slots.
Dungeon Master 02:34:04 That's pretty good.
Kaladen Shash 02:34:16 Useful. Yeah. Yep. Very good. What level, so the sixth level artificer?
Leopold Magnus 02:34:28 I can slice and dice. Two attacks now. Yeah, I can. Fifth. Yeah. Yep, two and five. And then also I have a conjure.
Dungeon Master 02:34:32 Okay. I've got some fun ones. Oh, you can do two attacks. You're very quiet about that.
Zariel Torgan 02:34:36 Oh, sweet. That's awesome, dude.
Kaladen Shash 02:34:47 Fifth level, so you're two and five. OK. OK, cool, cool, cool. I'm just logging off.
Leopold Magnus 02:34:57 I think is an extra. No, it's not super interesting, but might be slightly useful.
Dungeon Master 02:35:15 Okay, found something that I think will be cool. You guys, as you are walking through the forest, you see there is a couple different things. The first that you notice being this large
Dungeon Master 02:35:41 um very on brand but it almost looks like this large dog type creature except it's super warped and uh like its large muscular features are a little bit exaggerated but it's got this white fur that has this weird skin poking up on this long almost feline tail that pops up behind it but
Dungeon Master 02:36:06 more than that is it's like sort of you guys are walking up and you see it on a main trail so you guys will say we're cutting through the brush and we'll start it off with sort of a stealth check to see how effective you are not being noticed but
Dungeon Master 02:36:20 behind that about 10 feet you see skulking and moving with uneven movement onto its knuckles and sort of kicks forward and like sort of ape walking but like you see an intelligence behind its eyes this humanoid monstrosity um preacher that like you can smell it
Dungeon Master 02:36:45 from there um it has this putrid scent and it's covered in these boils as its long sort of scraggly head falls over this face it's like oozing black goop as it just sort of um like again it's like walking on this path but like hobbling and we'll see if that just does yeah so that is the creature as it's sort of like just
Kaladen Shash 02:36:48 Hello.
Dungeon Master 02:37:15 Lumbers through this space, speaking a language you don't understand, almost talking to itself or to this other creature. And then I lost the other one, but it was pretty cool again. But again, large dog sort of shape as it moves in front of it, almost under command, as you would assume. And then, like I said, everybody go ahead and give me.
Dungeon Master 02:37:45 A. Oh, there it is. Uh, yeah, every give me a group stealth check.
Zariel Torgan 02:37:54 Stealth. Seven. Oh, no. Eh, nice. Not bad at all.
Kaladen Shash 02:38:09 21. Even better. 15 ain't bad. That is not bad. That's cool, that's cool.
Leopold Magnus 02:38:11 Oh, but I have disadvantage. 15.
Zariel Torgan 02:38:25 Like an average of 15. Oh, sweet. That's cool looking.
Dungeon Master 02:38:26 You see these two creatures moving together. And let me just do a perception check. You guys have a 15 average. It beats the passive. So we'll see if they get it.
Dungeon Master 02:38:53 And they don't have a huge bonus. It is plus two to this rule. So I'll just do them. Ooh. 17. You guys are sort of tucked away in this brush. And as this
Dungeon Master 02:39:17 brolish creature is sort of giving these brute commands to this definitely like subordinate role dog like very hunter like that's what the imagery it evokes as it's like sort of commanding it through you see this dog is sort of sniffing the ground and you see picks up a whiff real
Dungeon Master 02:39:39 quick before you see it. It doesn't lock eyes, but it faces directly into the brush where you guys are. I'll say it was close enough that I'll give you a chance. If you wanted to run, you could. But where we'll leave it is like this creature knows something is there. It was searching. And so it has the idea, as it picks up this scent, that it's going to head where you guys are. But this doesn't just jump directly into initiative.
Dungeon Master 02:40:12 You guys have a chance to do something if you'd like. Hi, everybody. Go ahead and enroll me initiative and we'll
Zariel Torgan 02:40:12 I think, I don't know about you guys, but I think we're probably gonna just try to Merc this thing. I need some deodorant.
Kaladen Shash 02:40:20 100% working. Yeah, I would have.
Leopold Magnus 02:40:25 Well, this thing is quite foul and I think we best dispatch it.
Dungeon Master 02:40:39 I like it when we do it like this, but we'll do, this is just where we'll stop for the night and we'll pick up next session with the combat. All right, 22, 22.
Zariel Torgan 02:40:44 Ooh. Natural 20 for a 22. I think your dex is higher. But if you'll... Still pretty damn good, you guys.
Kaladen Shash 02:40:50 Very cool. Oh. I also, I rolled a 22 as well, but it was not a nat 20, so you just went that whole roll.
Leopold Magnus 02:40:52 Oh, nice. Mine almost was a natural 20 roll over, but still pretty good. Damn, when are these guys going to roll?
Dungeon Master 02:41:10 16. I'll let you know in a second. Let me get this piped out. No, I won't do that. We'll get you guys time to prayer. Think about it. This will probably be pretty hard, actually.
Zariel Torgan 02:41:13 This thing's going to be dead before we even... Oh, don't tell me that.
Leopold Magnus 02:41:20 Maybe we should get a round of combat in.
Dungeon Master 02:41:38 Okay, one of them has plus one to Dex. And the other one's got... Okay. I wish I had the encounter pre-planned. I could just add them to initiative without telling you guys, but we'll... I think it's more fun.
Dungeon Master 02:42:11 We've got 10 initiative and eight in initiative. Okay, you guys will lead this whole thing. You guys come up on these three monsters.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:27 Sweet. Yeah, I do kind of like it when we start a session with combat. I always like that more because you just jump right into it. Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 02:42:28 Nice. Start kicking some ass. Yeah, that was productive. We got a lot of stuff done.
Dungeon Master 02:42:53 Way more downtime than I anticipated. That was a great teleport. You guys were in the bottom category. You are, like, it was almost certain to be really bad no matter what, unless you rolled, like, it was above a 77% or something.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:53 Yeah, I definitely didn't think we were going to be halfway to the other dome by now. It's fantastic. It was a great roll. Yeah, direct route.
Kaladen Shash 02:42:59 No, that was a good teleport. Yeah, do we, we kind of decided on heading through the forest, right? We're all okay with that. Like hit that bridge, go for the forest.
Leopold Magnus 02:43:13 Oh, wow. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I mean, might as well just carve a path through there. Maybe we can leave some breadcrumbs or something so we can work our way back if needed.
Kaladen Shash 02:43:30 Yeah, love it.
Dungeon Master 02:43:40 I like the plan. I like it so far. We'll do it just because I want things to not be too slowly. It'll be built in checks on a little system for how quickly you make it through.
Dungeon Master 02:43:59 But think of things you want to do while you're out, you know? The fight will hopefully go pretty good and you guys won't have to, you know, do something drastic right away. But assuming you make your way to the forest, think of a lot of things you want to look for, let me know so I can prep things ahead of time accordingly. But you guys will just do like a certain number of days for successful checks, things to encounter, all that fun stuff.
Leopold Magnus 02:44:30 Yeah, right on.
Dungeon Master 02:44:32 I wanted you guys to uh engage at the tavern so badly and you didn't do it well sort of there were huge plot points that you guys just stepped right over that like I couldn't
Kaladen Shash 02:44:42 So just bet on things you mean like work through the tables. Well, by not just trying to like talk to randos in the bar.
Zariel Torgan 02:44:45 This is.
Dungeon Master 02:44:57 They're like, yeah, I couldn't work back in. I was like, well, shit, I don't know how to do this there. Uh, but you guys are like, now we, we fucking go right for the bed and then wake up and get our stuff. And then we're going to learn spells. And you just sort of spent, you spend all your time indoors. Let's do a couple into that. I was thinking about that. I thought it was funny. I was like, okay. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:45:02 Yeah. Nose down. We have a mission.
Kaladen Shash 02:45:17 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:45:22 Yeah, yeah, I'm excited We're gonna come back and it's be a whole nother government
Dungeon Master 02:45:29 I think it'll be interesting. I have to make myself a note for what's going to change in the time that you guys are gone, if anything. Because I always forget about it, but everything has to keep moving while you guys are out. I think it'll be cool.
Leopold Magnus 02:45:41 Oh, interesting. OK. That's super cool.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:00 Sweet. All right, well, yeah, that was awesome. Oh, awesome. Yeah, I'll have to see what my schedule looks like. Oh, lame.
Dungeon Master 02:46:06 Are you guys. I didn't see that I feel that my my works Christmas party is that day in Portland, so I will be in Portland. yeah i'm sorry.
Leopold Magnus 02:46:06 Oh yeah, I was going to say that I sent out the invite to Jonathan and Bryn, but Jesse, if you're in town the weekend of the 14th, Megan and I are having a holiday party, so. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 02:46:32 No worries, but feel free to come by. If you need a place to stay, we can put you up here. No worries about that either. Cool. Excellent. I'll post the invite. Megan and her friend made it, and it's very fancy. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:41 Awesome. Yeah, well, I'll opt to check it out.
Dungeon Master 02:46:52 cute. It's really Yeah, I thought it was cute. I like you sent it and I opened it in the first thing I saw was December 14.
Kaladen Shash 02:46:53 Thanks for my solidification again.

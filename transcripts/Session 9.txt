Dungeon Master 00:00:00 So now recording. You then found yourselves all sort of, he gave you about a half hour, so you have a little bit of time to get to the meeting room. But once you guys all sort of, if you do nothing else, get to the meeting room, you walk in and you see a big open table in the center of the room.
Zariel Torgan 00:00:02 Meh.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:05 Sorry. I just didn't want to.
Dungeon Master 00:00:21 a map of the district. You see some pieces here, empty notepads, and standing sort of all next to each other, leaning onto the table, you see Ratchet. In the center, Lord Marshall Thurer, who you haven't seen in a while, as he was sort of like on an unknown location for the High Council, like he didn't put on some sort of
Dungeon Master 00:00:45 You don't know if it's like technically secret mission, but he just hasn't been present and you had to ask questions before and you weren't able to get him at all. So it's a little bit of a surprise to see him standing there and not to his left. On your guys's right, you see Captain Levi also sort of sitting there, one hip stuck a little bit farther out, absorbed in the material. But you guys sort of walk in and take their attention up and they just stare at you for a moment, gesture you in. Sort of lean back.
Dungeon Master 00:01:15 And at that moment, Ratchet goes, right, for documentation purposes, initiating meeting 435 in the afternoon on the Sabbath. We have in our presence the new recruits, he looks down at his paperwork, the odeers, meeting on this meeting myself, commanding officer of the group, district,
Kaladin Shash 00:01:37 Hmm. I
Zariel Torgan 00:01:37 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:01:44 Captain Levi, as well as High Marshal Thurr, who has graced us with his presence. Gentlemen, you have a bit of time. Plead your case and we'll allocate materials necessary based on that. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:02:03 So out of game, we're just trying to pitch them why we think it's important to jump on this? Okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:02:12 Uh, Jonathan, could we say I had talked to the, the priest guy a little bit. I just, in terms of the information we have about how many chapels they would have had. Um, cause he mentioned there's a few others around town. Like, what has that been knowledge we could access that maybe we can convince this guy with.
Dungeon Master 00:02:26 Mm-hmm. Yeah, you guys, I believe, did at the time pull up on your, like, your, like, not holographic projection, but you have arcane projecting capabilities on, like, your wristbands of your armor issued to you by the Legionnaire that sort of show you a general map of the Dawn District. And then I believe you had gone to the library and tried to pull information about existing chapels and things like that, and you had sorted it by type.
Dungeon Master 00:02:57 This is all things that you had already done.
Leopold Magnus 00:03:00 Excellent. Yeah, so I'll go ahead and I'll pull, I'll boop in to my arcane projector on my wrist. And I'll say, according to my research, we suggest five or however many chapels there are. So I'll project them up. So I mean, I guess, how many are there? That would specifically be related to, these guys were from the Church of, I can't remember their name again.
Dungeon Master 00:03:28 They claim to be from they like under they call themselves the hand of God Yeah, but they seem to be Like the missing people are corresponding to old chapel of the tails that are being used like broken down run down like that Go ahead and roll a d6. Maybe you get lucky. Maybe you don't
Leopold Magnus 00:03:33 Viteo, hand of God. OK. Right. OK, yeah. That's right. OK, so I'll project up the chapels of Viteo. And how many are on the map? OK.
Leopold Magnus 00:04:10 A5. OK.
Dungeon Master 00:04:13 uh, in your map, after you put in all your filters and specifications, you see that there are five chapels, uh, that sort of fit the general district description, uh, and like outskirt location types that father color had informed you of. Um, and the main chapel of a tale, um, is included in that because you guys had ran into the cultists in like the mausoleum graveyard in the corner of it. So that it's, it's,
Dungeon Master 00:04:41 four new ones, one that you've already been to.
Leopold Magnus 00:04:45 So I'll project that out. I'll point the one that we were just at, and I'll say, this is where we encountered the cultists. They were posted up out in the graveyard. Very suspect, folks. But if you present yourself as if you were one of them, you might be able to enter. I suggest we enter all four chapels out here, here, and here, at the same time, coming in with a crash party. Anyone else?
Kaladin Shash 00:05:15 More to the purpose of the attack is, it feels like this group is more organized than we understand, and it'd be prudent to take it out. Need more resources to be able to do this. We do understand at least where one of the entrances are, and perhaps another is inside the chapel itself.
Kaladin Shash 00:05:43 We have the keys for one of the inferences right now.
Dungeon Master 00:05:50 They sort of share a look. They look to you, Zario. I think you're going to say something.
Zariel Torgan 00:05:50 Yeah. Yeah, sorry I didn't know you were going to say something. I was just going to say that it probably would be prudent to, like he had just mentioned, get a little more research. I think our concern is that they areâ€¦
Zariel Torgan 00:06:15 efficient and very dedicated to their cause. I think going in guns blazing without sufficient troops could be pretty disastrous. I know that there might be more individuals than we maybe had thought and maybe that you had thought considering you just had us on the trail.
Zariel Torgan 00:06:45 I think that perhaps we could send in an informant, somebody other than us that hasn't been seen to get a better idea of the scope. Either that or we just get as many people as we possibly can. You know, that would be my only suggestion.
Dungeon Master 00:07:03 You see Captain Levi sort of reviewing some documents from the incaridation and everything he's gotten from Ratchet so far. He looks at videos. And I'm not to understand this correctly that when you were in that graveyard, that courtyard initially that you saw, he sort of counted out more than 16 individuals who sort of just converged on the area at the same time.
Kaladin Shash 00:07:04 Yes, perhaps. It is correct.
Dungeon Master 00:07:33 Yes, right, and it's also my understanding that you have made yourselves known to these folks, all of them, in the brief excursion and then subsequent kidnapping of this tiefling individual.
Zariel Torgan 00:07:51 When you put it like that, it doesn't sound very good.
Kaladin Shash 00:07:53 There is also very prudent observation, yes, very true.
Dungeon Master 00:08:00 They chat with each other for a second. And then Captain Levi takes a moment to look back at you. And he goes, well, I put it that way to point out that this is not a very good situation. And they go back to chatting a little bit. And he goes, all right, the way I see it is it seems like from everything we've gathered, there's something going down soon. You guys have convened this mission, this meeting under the pretense of urgency.
Dungeon Master 00:08:30 Let's clarify some things here, as the Lord Marshal has something to say in just a moment, but are we wanting to do something about this right now? Are we meeting here to discuss something else?
Kaladin Shash 00:08:52 Is there something else you want to discuss?
Dungeon Master 00:09:05 sort of chuckles himself. Uh, not really. Uh, sorry. I go ahead. Lord Marshall, he sort of backs off sheepishly and that Lord Marshall goes, Roy, the way I see this is, and, and pardon this, I will be leaving shortly. I was able to sneak away. Um, just cause I oversee this branch and this, this seems pressing, but, um,
Dungeon Master 00:09:34 I like you guys, I really do. The point being is you have not been with us very long. Given the expressed urgency, and obviously the Legionnaires always got each other's back if this gets more severe, I will allow... He looks at Ratchet. Donnie, you are to lead this group. He looks over to Levi. Captain, I expect you to lead your own strike team.
Dungeon Master 00:10:03 And then he sort of looks down, he looks up at you guys, biting his patience a little bit, and he goes, and I will allocate one task force of Omen Knights to secure whatever location you don't visit, but however you narrow this down, you will have only the three groups. Do you think you can do this?
Leopold Magnus 00:10:31 So that's three, then four, including us? OK. Right. So we have three groups and four locations, five locations.
Dungeon Master 00:10:36 Well, it'll be Ratchet plus you guys, so one group. Captain Levi will have his own group, and then this Omin Knight task force that you haven't met will just sort of fill in whatever the other location is.
Kaladin Shash 00:10:40 Yep. It's three squads.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:51 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:10:56 I'm going to ask, so I'll say, I think we can do it, but on one condition. And I'm going to ask for him to provide booby trap support for the two chapel exits that we won't be covering.
Dungeon Master 00:11:07 raises an eyebrow.
Leopold Magnus 00:11:18 So either that could be something like setting it up to where it blows the entrance so they can't get in or out that way, or something else of that nature that limits them from exiting out those entrances. Yeah, something where they won't be a problem.
Zariel Torgan 00:11:25 Yep.
Kaladin Shash 00:11:30 Or just a magical cage once they're out of the door. Collecting.
Dungeon Master 00:11:35 He sort of strokes his beard, thinks it over, and he goes, Levi, I trust you can sacrifice one of your more arcane-blessed mages to watch down a location to blow it up? He looks at you as if that's confirming what you've asked. If need be, obviously, not unnecessarily.
Leopold Magnus 00:12:06 Yes, I think that would suffice as long as they cannot enter or exit. We can hunt them down.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:13 So out of game, real quick, are we talking about just going in and just like murking these dudes? Is that what we're talking about doing?
Dungeon Master 00:12:21 That's what you guys had talked about last time. I'm confirming or you're sort of bringing up is that you still would like to do?
Kaladin Shash 00:12:27 I'm trying. So I think I think we do have a chance to make this like as clean up as possible, but still SWAT style. Hence, if we don't need to explode the doors, is there some opportunity to use some sort of arcane trap bubble dome? So right as they go through the exit, they're just captured like in a like an, you know, like a magic prison. They can't get out of. Because we plus some. Well,
Leopold Magnus 00:12:50 Yeah, or magically lock the door so they can't exit, like their key doesn't work.
Kaladin Shash 00:12:56 Locking the door doesn't help a lot unless they want to surrender. We're still active combatants.
Zariel Torgan 00:12:59 Yeah, I think my question would be Yeah, I think my question would be like isn't there like uh, I think I remember something like this some sort of like magical equivalent to like handcuffs That we have That I mean, I don't want to just Go, I mean, I mean, they're probably bad, but I don't know that they're all bad. It's probably like a cult type situation you know, and so I I guess my question would be like Can't we like
Leopold Magnus 00:13:19 That's the spirit. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, my thought. Oh, go ahead, Brent. Yeah, I was thinking, so narrow the exits so they can really only go out of one place, and then flush
Kaladin Shash 00:13:23 No, I agree. That's why. That's why. I think I think that's the goal.
Zariel Torgan 00:13:29 like do non lethal force to like the ones that look like they might not be bad and then try to capture as many people as we can without just straight murder. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:13:40 Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:13:48 the rest of them out. So it's like filling up an anthill with water. Yep.
Kaladin Shash 00:13:54 That's perfect, yeah, so if they explode all the other exits and we put some sort of magical trap on the one we enter through. As they flee past us or whatever, they're just trapped or we encounter them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:14:06 Yeah, we could have somebody that's just like shooting like little globes of invulnerability or whatever those like not that's not what it's called, but like the little, you know, balls of magic that like trap people as they're coming out.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:19 Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
Dungeon Master 00:14:19 Yeah, I think you guys would have picked up that he was not so subtly trying to like remind you guys that you are pretty much new recruits still at this point. And you're asking a lot. So he's like, here is what I can allocate for something that you're claiming to be as big as it is. And he and he did follow it up with, we will have more resources if it does turn out to be this big. But you guys are asking a lot with not
Dungeon Master 00:14:46 as much to show for at this point so he's like this is what i'll give you up front allocate it how you will and obviously if shit hits the fan you guys start getting like murked left and right there will be a greater force ready but he's sort of letting you know like you have three forces one of them will split off one member who can sort of close down uh an exit if it becomes a problem but otherwise
Kaladin Shash 00:14:47 I really appreciate it.
Dungeon Master 00:15:13 you should focus on how are you going to move the pieces you have. And then he stands up and he goes, he goes all the way around the table and stands pretty close to Callit and you notice he picks specifically and he goes, like sort of whispering a little bit to you as he leaves, he goes, now I trust you with this information, but.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:18 Okay. Yeah, well, I mean.
Kaladin Shash 00:15:21 So we try.
Dungeon Master 00:15:37 I am under scrutiny of the council and I suspect it's because something didn't go the way a certain individual wanted. In other words, I am tracking what I believe to be a leak in our government itself. So I am tied up. I trust that you can reach out if you need help. And I will get back to you, but and then he then he speaks up loudly. Gentlemen, I must see myself out. He leaves.
Dungeon Master 00:16:05 So leaves you with ratchet and Captain Levi and leave it goes That was sort of what I was trying to get to before is he needs to leave but gentlemen I Can manage a lot of what you can't My group specifically is pretty adept at scoping out large areas at one time so we could
Dungeon Master 00:16:29 potentially sort of just be on the rooftops of the district in certain areas you want us keep in recon and surveillance and sort of will converge on any area if it's a problem, but That just leaves you guys to decide where you want to sort of start this off at And I hope for your sake and your asses that this is what you think it's going to be
Kaladin Shash 00:16:50 Quick question above table just to our group. Is our thought process right now set up, just like Jonathan suggested, one team as like surveillance in a district close to the main Batao Chapel and then concentrate our effort and the Omin Knights on the same target? We're trying to take down the primary chapel.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:14 Yeah. Yeah, I think what would make the most sense? Well, and even just like mechanically wise for the game, just because that way, Jonathan won't have to run like a 1015 person group fight, um, would be to have us as a group with ratchet go in at a location, and then have the other group go in at like, what would be considered the opposite location.
Zariel Torgan 00:17:39 and then we would just like dungeon crawl to what we would think is like the epicenter and then the third group could just be in the general district watching for people popping out or you know that that's my thought but i'm yeah i'm open but yeah yeah because my thought is that
Kaladin Shash 00:17:49 That's perfect. That's what I was thinking. Making sure we're all on the same page. No.
Leopold Magnus 00:17:57 No, that sounds good. And then just kind of push them together and make them all even the same exit. Yeah, I agree. I think, do you think it would be useful to like set out and
Zariel Torgan 00:18:06 You know, we don't want to go in there as like a giant 30 person group, because that'll make the fights this log for one and for two, it's not very efficient when you're trying to, you know, weed out the catacombs, you want to be spread out. So I think that I think that works good if you guys like it.
Kaladin Shash 00:18:22 I like that.
Leopold Magnus 00:18:26 monitor the group for a little bit, try to get some intel, like kind of movements and things like that before we head in. They're already ready. Yeah. Okay. Let's just roll in.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:36 personally, at a game, I'm really concerned that we have already taken too much time. We went in, we made our presence known that we knew that there's like this secret organization, I think there's a small chance that we get there and they're just like, gone. I mean, they would have no reason. Yeah, they have no reason to stay. I mean, it's it's a good cover. But I mean, if they're really a secret organization, you don't have somebody show up and like steal a dude and then think, that's probably nothing.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:07 Yeah, yeah, and I mean we've only how long has it been not long since we kidnapped that guy Yeah
Zariel Torgan 00:19:11 Yeah, Jonathan, how long has it been in-game since that happened? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:19:19 The kidnapping? That was earlier in the day. We'll say like, if you went there in the morning, you had spent some time looking around, you went and saw the sermon, you went out the back, you maybe encountered these people alike.
Dungeon Master 00:19:35 One ish. And then you hustled back to the core with him in tow, interrogated him for a little bit, an hour or so. And this meeting is taking place at like four 30 in the afternoon. So it's on the cusp of evening of the same day, but it's been, it's been at least a few hours since all of this kicked off.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:54 OK, now hold on. I distinctly remember when we charmed him, the one guy I said, how long are you going to be gone for? How long did he say? Do you guys remember? Do you remember that conversation? Right.
Zariel Torgan 00:20:09 Um. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:20:11 Today I think I think it was really light-hearted like like don't worry. It won't be long I'll be back because I thought it was strange. She was leaving with us. I don't think it was like, oh Right Well, I think it's strange I think they think it's strange and they know there was almost something that occurred that we gave them the wrong password I think they're they're on to something but yes, they might just be not at super high level
Dungeon Master 00:20:14 I don't remember that. Right, you only charmed one person in a group of 18.
Leopold Magnus 00:20:21 Yeah, so I mean, if it was like, I'll be gone the rest of the day, then we could probably still attack with cover and not be expected. Yeah, figuring it out.
Kaladin Shash 00:20:41 Right. An hour. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:20:43 Yeah, I think the rest of the group was under the impression that there might have been a misunderstanding, but the moment that this guy didn't come back within whatever, they're already planning. So, at least I think. So yeah, I say we just, you know, we hit the bricks and we just go for it.
Leopold Magnus 00:21:01 Yeah, I believe that. Let's roll.
Kaladin Shash 00:21:13 Yeah, disperse. Are they? Do they dispense? Do they dispense any additional items whenever we're task forcing it like this?
Dungeon Master 00:21:20 All right, well then.
Zariel Torgan 00:21:28 Oh yeah, do we get any like magic handcuffs or, you know, anything like that?
Dungeon Master 00:21:35 As you guys split up and you all sort of give your nods and you sort of work out the details in a way that we don't have to cover because you guys did discuss it sort of pretty comprehensively just now with overseeing the general area. Another team enters the other location, you guys enter the main location, whichever that is will be figured out based on whatever you decide to do, but we'll say it was pre-planned. But then you head out with Ratchet and he sort of gives you a look and he goes, I'm not calling myself the O'Dears, just so you're aware.
Dungeon Master 00:22:05 But this is, I will say, a fun part of the job. And he takes you to like the back room, and he opens up and he goes, you can take a few of each. Don't hug too much to yourself. But you get a little bit more when you do this. And there's no like magic handcuff equivalent, but there are like
Dungeon Master 00:22:28 enchanted cuffs where like you can bind people and once they've been like subdued so like in game knocked out and not a problem unconscious will in like bind their power down they can't lash out but it's not like such a game-breaking thing where that i'm going to give you handcuffs that if you put on somebody successfully you can basically silence them we're not at that point yet but you get like the
Zariel Torgan 00:22:44 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:22:56 Yeah, like the suppression things you're looking for. You have like, what is essentially an arcane stun grenade where it's like, you see like these really intricate gears set in a certain spot, where if you pull a pin, they spin rapidly and set off a series, not just one, a series of like spells that all cast daylight for a split second. So it stuns and flashes everybody in the moment. Good for like entering a space.
Kaladin Shash 00:23:22 Flash. OK. Cool.
Zariel Torgan 00:23:23 Nice. Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:23:25 You guys get a manual extra injection syringe, so you guys each get another minor healing potion on top of the one that already comes in your suits that's been refreshed. And a few other things here and there, but nothing major. And it goes, beyond this, I expect that you'll be able to sort of fend for yourselves. You've done all right already. Like I said, I'll tag along.
Dungeon Master 00:23:50 I'll mostly take up a defensive position supporting you guys. I'm not I'm all right in the battlefield, but my main role tends to be healing so I'll provide when needed but otherwise I trust that you guys can finish a contract there will be a reward obviously, but uh Maybe I skim a little off the topic to make me do too much and he sort of laughs to himself and he goes. All right um I got the word that uh
Dungeon Master 00:24:18 The Omen Knights are on their way too, they just got called off another mission, so they'll be here momentarily, and as he says that, sort of, not busting down the door, but very quickly sort of knocks it in, and you see a tall, elven-heritaged man, he's got like a slight point to his ears, he's got striking blonde hair and a cut jawline, muscular and tall in like this deep obsidian black intricate armor,
Dungeon Master 00:24:45 Radiate a magical aura and he walks in the eyes you down and like. Three identical people sort of step in behind them they're all different people but they're just very cookie cutter like bad ass kind of look they look like they're out of a stereotype. Any sort of not because those. We ready to rock and roll or what he spits out like some tobacco to the side because. Manners obviously i'm so very sun seeker.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:08 We're.
Dungeon Master 00:25:13 Behind me to my left, laser. On his right, blazer. To his right, taser. And he goes, we'll be recon in the other section. Hope it's worth it. And they don't say where, they're like, yeah. You know it. All of them spit chewing tobacco out at the same time.
Leopold Magnus 00:25:29 So for clarification, that was laser, laser, and taser? Got it. OK.
Kaladin Shash 00:25:34 Laser blazer. Just same same NPC, just. This boo boo boo. Jonathan, can you make? I was gonna say the I just kind of wrote down that we essentially have a flash grenade. Can you?
Zariel Torgan 00:25:41 Oh, that's so funny.
Dungeon Master 00:25:53 You guys chat for a little bit. You get all that going. Oh, what was that? Yeah, you guys can all pick up one or one person can get two, that kind of deal. But essentially how it works is if it
Kaladin Shash 00:26:02 Just give us a little bit more on the stats on that thing like radius and do we all have one or do a group get one?
Dungeon Master 00:26:17 you don't enter the space that you throw it into, but it has a 30 foot radius, so 60 feet side to side in the full circle, will give somebody disadvantage on like any sort of a check. So if you throw it in and then it goes off and you jump in and it's an initiative, whoever is affected by it would have disadvantage on their initiative check. And then in the first round of the encounter, they have disadvantage on all their checks and stuff, but it fades pretty quickly.
Dungeon Master 00:26:47 So it's just a first round that affects everything.
Kaladin Shash 00:26:50 Okay. That's fine.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:53 So just to, I know we already talked about this, just to clarify a little tiny bit, um, with the magical handcuffs, can we just say, um, I was, I was thinking it was going to be that way that it would, you know, once we brought somebody down to zero, I just was hoping that maybe we don't have to mention it in game. Anybody that seems like they're not like trying to just murder us. We just kind of automatically throw them on there.
Dungeon Master 00:27:16 Yeah. A legionnaire version of like the zip ties, you know, non-lethal, but effective at subduing people as you move forward. Yeah. You've got enough of those that you can sort of, as you clear out spaces, take out anybody you need to. Yep. Good clarification. I do like that.
Kaladin Shash 00:27:24 Yeah, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:29 Yeah. Yeah. And I just was hoping that we could just have it be going on in the background that we automatically do that to anybody. That way we don't forget and then, okay. Well, then, yeah, I'm
Dungeon Master 00:27:48 Somebody get rid of me. He goes, oddly enough, nobody's ever brought this up before. You guys have an issue with your volume.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:50 Yeah, yeah, I'm good. Do we have the ability to talk to Ratchet about having like a stealth mode on our intercoms? Or is there like, like, like, if we're going SWAT versus like, yeah, can we just ask him about that? Yeah, it's, it's loud.
Kaladin Shash 00:28:01 Is there a volume control? Yeah, that's a good call. Yeah, here we are.
Dungeon Master 00:28:17 Uh, he goes, um, sure. Um, I obviously don't know any shit about this. Um, you can go see Ham Hawk if you'd like. It won't be that way. I don't know. Maybe.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:28 If he just tells us to turn a dial, I'm gonna be pissed. Okay. All right, do we...
Kaladin Shash 00:28:38 Well, no. So nothing for the... So not for this mission. Not ready for this mission, is what we're saying. They can do it that quickly. I mean, this is how we have to coordinate with the Omen Knights. It feels like it's worth it.
Dungeon Master 00:28:47 Fuck if I know. Maybe. Gentlemen, I manage peoples and I heal others I do not enchant. So I wish I could give you more information, but I can't. I'll wait
Zariel Torgan 00:29:14 It's alright. Leo's got an in with Hamhawk. He's his apprentice so maybe on the way out of town, we'll just have him swing by, yeah. It's raw talent. Raw talent.
Dungeon Master 00:29:20 No shit! How'd you fucking swing that? As far as I heard, Hammock wasn't taking any apprentices. That must be some good trick you did. Shut it off.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:23 That's right, yes. Well, that was the case until I came along, to be honest. So something special about me. I just kind of cracked my robot knuckles. And now let me take a look at that stun grenade, actually. And I'm going to kind of fumble it a little bit on accident and kind of start to maybe see if I can open it. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:29:33 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:50 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:53 Uh, maybe I'll inspect that later. Make, make note of that for, uh, maybe a synthesis in her lab.
Dungeon Master 00:30:04 Yeah, and then you guys, you make your way all the way to Hamhawk's. I won't move the map over or anything, because it'll be pretty quick. You're chatting with Hamhawk, and she goes, you don't like the fucking volley goon? Shit, if I knew that, I just thought you guys were all hard of healing like I was. Anyway, yeah, let me do something. How could we fix this? And she's sort of working it out on like,
Dungeon Master 00:30:29 like a basically a magical whiteboard where she's like writing on it with an arcane like chalk piece and like can move the equations to the side as you try to figure out different things to do. I figure you guys always tend to make a check for something in her lab so go ahead and give me investigation of perception while you wait as she sort of basically will work up the equivalent of like
Dungeon Master 00:30:52 a Prestidigitation spell that she can put on top of it, something low magic so it's not going to ruin the original, but that can like basically quiet or raise the volume as needed. Yeah, just as you're sort of in her shop waiting for her to finish.
Kaladin Shash 00:31:03 You want an investigation check, so you said? 30, 20. OK, everybody got an average, everybody.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:13 Oh, everybody? Okay. Well. It's pretty good.
Dungeon Master 00:31:23 2017-12. Paladins, you're sort of like rocking back and forth on your heels to your toes, just sort of whistling to yourself. You glance over and like in the far edge of her shop, normally where like her personal projects are, you see a schematic roughly drawn out
Dungeon Master 00:31:44 that looks like a really intricate handle with a bunch of gears and working pieces and a bunch of equations written out with like arrows pointing to certain spots. And then there's two guide sort of framed wires that go up the length of what looks like a sword, but completely hollow. And it's got like arcane symbols and quotation marks and question marks and like formulas written underneath it, circled around an energy core.
Dungeon Master 00:32:13 As they're sort of certain at it, you're like, that looks like a sword, but a weird sword. And that's just something you sort of notice. You don't see any actual pieces or anything. It's just like a schematic thrown to the side. And then, like, after that, shortly you see Hammock comes back, she goes, pulls up her sort of pants that are like loosely fitting behind her bib, and she goes, well, this is the best I can do on short notice. There's a quiet mode or a loud mode.
Dungeon Master 00:32:43 Sorry, I can't do both, but just toggle it back and forth. You can have a sort of partially muted. I intentionally slacked off in the enchantment so that it wouldn't fully silence it. But pretty much what you're asking for, I'm pretty sure, right? Like you just want to audio control. Got it. Anything else?
Kaladin Shash 00:33:01 A whisper? Yes, a whisper in the ear instead of somebody shouting. Thank you. Hemlock, what is... Hemlock, what is this... What is this magic sword I see over here? What is this blueprint for? Is this something you do?
Leopold Magnus 00:33:14 Oh, the hammock. Oh, go ahead.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:17 What?
Dungeon Master 00:33:28 See a grin crawls across her face as you've like touched on something. She's pretty proud of she goes, uh this bad boy Yeah, I saw some uh There was a reports of a a bandit not too long ago who was wielding a weapon like this some sort of like Fire energy came out of his hilt and he was attacking people with it. He was eventually subdued, but he destroyed the weapon Before we could get our hands on it. So I was like thinking to myself How could I do that?
Dungeon Master 00:33:58 I haven't quite figured it out yet, but I'm on to something and I think I could take it up a notch, right? Like, forget fire. Fire is mundane mage shit, right? That's the shit of the past. I'm thinking like, what if I take heat energy at its core, I keep it at that temperature and I run it up in equal lengths up these guides and
Dungeon Master 00:34:24 And there's not really a name for it yet that I've found, but I think I'm going to call it Plasma or something like that. It's going to be cool if I can get it to work. Just think of like the hottest fucking sword on the planet.
Kaladin Shash 00:34:41 I like this very much.
Leopold Magnus 00:34:42 Jonathan, is there maybe a check I can do to make a glance at what Hamhawk has built and maybe suggest a small thing that would be useful to the construction of the weapon to maybe show off a little bit? If she's trying to make a plasma sword, does she have an arcane source of electricity to heat the metal while it's running or something? Maybe I can just kind of
Leopold Magnus 00:35:12 throw out a little aloof comment that might catch her eye. Yeah, I've got a plus 6 on that. OK. Ooh, nice, 23.
Dungeon Master 00:35:16 Mm-hmm. You can. You can throw a suggestion in. Yeah, absolutely. Give me, I don't know, what do you want to make? Like an Arcana check? Do you have proficiency in that? Is it higher than your straight intelligence? OK, go for it. 23. You're looking at it, and it occurs to you
Dungeon Master 00:35:46 that if she's reliant on these sort of like thin metal guides to create the energy that it's always going to be a weak point and you're like okay how does she get the length of the weapon out of none of that but around this one source you're like okay if she has different levels of gears that activate at different times she can sort of have a set flow of current through whatever energy core she has and they would
Dungeon Master 00:36:15 throw it up to a certain height no matter what. And so you sort of go, oh, why don't you do away with these guides, have it all internally based so there's no weak spot, and just figure out a way to have a consistent power output instead. And essentially guide her towards
Kaladin Shash 00:36:33 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:36:41 to like an efficient design for this saber of light, you know. And she scratches her head, she goes, huh, I'm not sure how I do that, but I like it. It's. It's better, I'll admit. Second.
Leopold Magnus 00:36:46 Great. Well, you're welcome, Hamhawk. I am quite the thorough apprentice, to be honest. I've been studying, and I've collected, and I just dump random pieces of metal and just assorted gears on her floor. I got all these for you.
Dungeon Master 00:37:11 Oh, thanks! You see, she likes signals too on Unseen Servant. She goes, thanks Theo, I really appreciate it. Uh, anyway, I gotta get back to working on this now that there's some justice. Uh... I mean, if you can find a fucking energy source that can take a sustained current, uh, bring him back.
Leopold Magnus 00:37:22 Yeah, well, of course, and if there's anything else I can gather for you while I'm out in the field, I'm always happy. Just let me know and I'll be off on my way. Right.
Dungeon Master 00:37:38 I'll think of actually making you my apprentice if you can manage that." Chuckles to herself like obviously in her mind that's not going to happen because you think that she probably figures that she could think of that already. But she does put it in your head that she did just offer to give you a legit offer if you bring something back. Then she turns away and she goes, ''Happy hunting, fellas.
Leopold Magnus 00:37:57 All right, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:38:02 I'm gonna make some modifications to my design you see she like may change over the documents and all the tools start floating to her main table she like. Has them suspended in the air as she grabs certain things to make different adjustments and throws out the formulas they sort of hover suspended in air would like projection energy and she's just working on it away as she sends you off.
Zariel Torgan 00:38:30 Yeah, let's fucking do it, guys. Let's go kill some people. Can we take a little time to maybe put on a different, uh, outfit? So we don't seem so, uh, cop-y? Or like we should-
Leopold Magnus 00:38:32 Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's right. Leopold rips the fake mustache and takes his aviators off.
Dungeon Master 00:38:35 Okay, so where would you guys like to make your entrance at?
Kaladin Shash 00:38:40 Um. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:39:01 that you've been wearing for the interrogation? Yeah, yeah, I've just had a fake mustache, like, you know, little I handle my mustache and aviators.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:01 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:39:05 He just had it on the whole time.
Kaladin Shash 00:39:18 I think so. I think what we could do is we could go to so Captain Levi can supervise like several blocks around the moon. The main Chapel. And then we can go to our group can go to the mausoleum entrance, so we have the key for that. And if we encounter anyone with a disguise, we can say the word or stun them and then still get in.
Kaladin Shash 00:39:44 The Omen Knights, we don't know where the other entrance is. Perhaps they could just be patrolling the chapel, and if they notice individuals exiting, right, they'll know where to, where that exit is or where that new entrance for the temple below. Is that something we got?
Dungeon Master 00:39:55 He. He was just at that one location, but you did sort of cut it down to just a few different buildings in the whole district that matched the description given.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:58 Didn't we get info from the guy we interrogated about other entrances? Yeah, I say we just send him in at the same time we go in.
Leopold Magnus 00:40:06 Yeah, I think so. And then also I had the map of all the Viteo temple entrances.
Kaladin Shash 00:40:15 Then yeah, then. Great. Yeah, I guess we'd want. Eyes on our. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:40:31 You go talk to him, you give him instructions, and he goes, just to be clear, I, Silverus Sunseeker, don't work for you, but because this does seem important, obviously we'll help out. Where do you need us to go?
Kaladin Shash 00:40:56 This is Captain Levi, who's talking right now. This is that Omen Knight. Yes, hello. We will just need you to use the opposite entrance from us. We will be entering here in the Mausoleum. We'll need you to enter. I will just show him on this map that we have. Through this entrance right here.
Dungeon Master 00:40:58 This is Sylvaris Sunseeker. This is that one Omen Knight. Sylvaris, Laser, Blazer, and Taser.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:59 No, it's the one that's different than the rest.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:01 the head omen night.
Kaladin Shash 00:41:28 We'll meet you inside.
Dungeon Master 00:41:30 Got it. So we converge at the bottom, we take out the bad guy, we all split the profit. Another day, another victory. Sort of looks smugly to himself. Fellas, roll out. And you see they all, like, have the same teleport ability, too. They're, like, really, really grossly into their whole, like, aesthetic, and they just, like, each vanish top to bottom. As they teleport away.
Leopold Magnus 00:41:58 Could have I interacted with them before? Could have I caught one before they all jumped away? OK.
Dungeon Master 00:41:59 And you hear watch it under his breath just goes fucking tools. Yeah, there's you guys have been planning for like, we'll say this whole planning process takes all of a one to two hours. So you'll be sort of executing this at the fall of dark, which is probably a little advantageous to you. But yeah, there's like time in between to have taken this out if you wanted to ask specific questions.
Leopold Magnus 00:42:27 Yeah, yeah. OK, so say during the planning, maybe I kind of sneak aside. I just kind of start poking the laser. I'm like, until he kind of turns my way. And I say, are you guys all clones? Hmm, interesting. And I kind of like start poking a little more. That's quite odd. Yes, you all.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:35 Bye.
Dungeon Master 00:42:40 Uh, what do you want? No. What? Do we seem like clones? So Varys believes that, uh...
Kaladin Shash 00:42:45 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:42:54 You have the same outfit, you look the same, you do your little hawk too, the same. It was just catching my eye. I thought maybe this was some, you know, cool little toy. Oh, yeah. Oh, wow. Well, have you thought about, hmm, that's quite interesting.
Dungeon Master 00:43:07 That if you look the same you sort of strike some fear into your enemies In all honesty, I'm a natural redhead. I just died at silver to match him I mean, I guess but if i'm being honest you guys are the first
Zariel Torgan 00:43:17 Heh heh.
Leopold Magnus 00:43:24 Do you feel like you have your own style? Don't you think that would be more important? Oh, I see. Yes. Oh, dear. Yes. Of course, you haven't been enlightened with the way of fashion. And I just kind of like,
Dungeon Master 00:43:35 members who've sort of gone different directions with your uniforms. Usually people want to look like a cohesive unit.
Zariel Torgan 00:43:50 Oh damn
Leopold Magnus 00:43:51 flip around and I point at my shoulders where it says, what does it say? Bone Crusher? Yeah. You see, I'm Bone Crusher. Yes, yes. Yeah, new band. Now I'm its lead singer.
Kaladin Shash 00:43:56 Bone crusher.
Dungeon Master 00:44:04 What's a bone crusher? I've, I've seen that on different people before too. Is that a, is that like a new thing, a new band or something? That's weird. The other guy, he didn't say much, but I'm pretty sure he was like a little higher up than you were.
Leopold Magnus 00:44:26 Hmm. Well, we've had some tryouts recently, but anyhow, interesting. Nice meeting you all. It'll be wonderful fighting with you on the battlefield.
Zariel Torgan 00:44:34 You're just going to ignore that lore drop? It's very in character.
Dungeon Master 00:44:37 Yeah, we'll see you at the bottom. And then we'll say that you guys had the main meeting and then he disappears after that. Yeah, he does leave you with the fact that he did very casually drop in that he's seen that title on somebody before.
Kaladin Shash 00:44:52 Right. Strange enough, who else does bone pressure? Oh, okay.
Leopold Magnus 00:44:57 I have no idea why it's on. Anyways, what? No, definitely not. Yeah, well, I don't think Leo knows why the suit of armor even says that. It would be in character to probably be a little bit clueless about it, although definitely notice the similarities.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:00 Yeah, it's gonna be in character for Leo to get like really crucial backstory information and just be like, all right.
Dungeon Master 00:45:07 No, I think he caught it, but I think Leo didn't expect it. Okay, yes.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:27 I also would like to admit that I 100% thought it was Taser, Taser, and Blazer. I'm good to go, I just thought that was funny.
Dungeon Master 00:45:35 No. Like the scene from Dodgeball, you know? This is laser. Blazer.
Kaladin Shash 00:45:41 Our user. Alright sweet, let's let's. Get the task force all position and do this execute.
Leopold Magnus 00:45:50 Yeah, that's great.
Dungeon Master 00:46:05 You guys, you suit up under, now under the cover of darkness. A little eerie, it's a foggy night in the Dawn District. There's just a low-hanging fog that sort of rolls on all the streets. You sort of make your way through various doorways and alleys up to the courtyard before eventually you guys do hit sort of the entrance. Low arcane runes, they don't
Dungeon Master 00:46:32 brightly glow now, but on the left of each of your chess pieces, you hear them call out just very softly. This is Silveris. We've made it to the location. Awaiting entrance on your part. Another one goes off. Captain Leiva, we've got the tops pretty well scoped out. Happy hunting, fellas.
Kaladin Shash 00:46:53 Very good. Watch for those that are fleeing. Capture those you can. We'll let you know as we enter.
Dungeon Master 00:47:18 What are you guys doing? Yeah, it was technically that one. I threw you guys at the beginning of the map just because.
Kaladin Shash 00:47:23 It was the entrance back here. Can we?
Leopold Magnus 00:47:31 Thank you very much.
Zariel Torgan 00:47:33 Are we going stealth as long as we can and just trying to sneak in and SWAT-style take out one person as quietly as we can, as far as we can? Or are we just going in guns blazing? Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:47:49 And I do a perception check. Do we even see? Are there already people? Because last time there were, there were still like a few people wandering through it, right? Right. Right.
Dungeon Master 00:47:57 Yeah, last time you were in this graveyard, as soon as you had sort of made yourselves known, an eerie number of people sort of just came out of nowhere. So you have sort of the foresight now to be like, let's check the area. Go ahead and give me either individual or we could do a group perception check.
Zariel Torgan 00:48:17 I've got good perception. Somebody wanted to give me advantage. 24.
Leopold Magnus 00:48:22 I can lend a hand or go ahead.
Kaladin Shash 00:48:22 I will gladly assist. Yeah, you can take advantage on that.
Dungeon Master 00:48:30 24, it doesn't take you long. You're sort of going along the fence line, hunched down, peeking up at certain spots. And after a while, you are 100% confident that there is not a single soul anywhere else on this block. There is not a single sound. There are no people. There are no flickering lights. Any surrounding buildings are dark. It is just you in this area.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:03 This is definitely a trap. I'll cast pass without a trace. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:49:08 Okay, let us move forward as quietly as we can. Is that target three or four people? Is that just everyone within 30 feet? Is that a 30 feet move?
Zariel Torgan 00:49:28 Let's see, it says, each creature you choose within 30 feet gets a plus 10 to stealth. So it'll last an hour, and it is concentration. So for an hour, as long as I keep this up, we can just keep constantly, as long as we're within 30 feet of each other.
Leopold Magnus 00:49:36 Nice. Would it be.
Kaladin Shash 00:49:36 How long? Is it concentration based or just time? Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:49:53 And I will say, I like the more generous ruling of Pass Without Trace, so this is what I like to follow. The spell applies to the people who are within that space when it is cast. You do not have to stay next to him to keep the benefits. If it is cast on you, it lasts on you as long as the spell is active. Technically, there's some controversy over the official ruling, but I like that one a little bit better because then you guys aren't sort of tied up as you would want to be.
Zariel Torgan 00:50:00 Oh. Yeah. Okay. Do we want to stealth then?
Kaladin Shash 00:50:12 That's what I've always played with. Yeah, that's the fun part. Yeah, yeah. Stuff. Hey Jonathan. I think just I think just because I have played armor, I have disadvantage right now because of I've got just like some generic stuff. Loaded, but will.
Leopold Magnus 00:50:26 Yeah, I don't know. I was going to say, is there a way I could maybe scan for. Go ahead.
Dungeon Master 00:50:34 Yeah. Ratchet does too. Oh, we had talked about that, right?
Kaladin Shash 00:50:44 Right, so what I have do I do? I have disadvantage for having this this type of armor that I have on right now. The medium. Great. Cause it's not like. It's not full plate, but it's giving me disadvantage right now. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 00:50:55 Yeah, because I have medium armor too. Should I do the same as well?
Dungeon Master 00:51:04 Go ahead and just roll straight. But Donnie, not Donnie, Ratchet does have disadvantage. So it's going to be a group check as long as you're together, but keep in mind that he's a little bit louder, which is why he primarily plays like a support.
Leopold Magnus 00:51:26 John, what are the strength requirements for wearing medium armor? Or is that like you have to have a feet in order to do that? I see. OK. So then mine is legit as well. Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:51:32 Efficiency. Or you would just tell you are a little legitimate walking suit of armor. You're going to be a little clunky. Do you want us to roll an initial stealth check?
Dungeon Master 00:51:32 It's like you have to be proficient and your class isn't proficient. Yeah. Yeah, go ahead and roll a stealth check.
Leopold Magnus 00:51:55 And then the other thing I wanted to look out for while we're kind of moving up slowly is I wanted to scan for traps, like maybe arcane traps, or like maybe arcana magic that was trying to be hidden. Is it possible to do that? Oh, a natural 20 on the stealth check. Oh, but it's with disadvantage bummer. Yep, same with me.
Dungeon Master 00:52:09 Yeah, go ahead. Nice. Disadvantage. That's right. Ratchet also got a nat 20, but his disadvantage was a 16 plus 3. So he has a 19 total. Oh, yours is also 19. Hell yeah. Pretty good so far. Yes, and you all get 10 on top of that.
Kaladin Shash 00:52:23 Wow, look at you though. Yeah. Correct, I rolled it too. Wait, what? Yeah, I rolled a two and got an 18 total. Yes, six plus yeah, that's it.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:24 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:29 So all of these are plus 10. So I rolled a 5. And so I got 15. Rat shit got 20. Yeah, and so you got 28. Oh.
Dungeon Master 00:52:46 Well, it's because it added 16 to it. Oh, because that's what it is, right? 10 plus 6. Nice. So it's really 29, 18, 29, and then what did, sorry, OK, you got 5 plus 10.
Kaladin Shash 00:52:55 Rule two is the hard one.
Leopold Magnus 00:52:55 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:04 Yeah, so 15. That's a pretty decent average.
Dungeon Master 00:53:20 It's pretty good. That's like a 22, 23-ish average. Stealthy. As quiet as you can, you hear the occasional squeak and metal, sort of upon metal sound. But you're careful to keep it down. It's hard to be quiet in this truly eerie space. But the heavy mist lends some benefit to you.
Dungeon Master 00:53:48 in like it mutes your movements a little bit. Everybody give me a perception check as you make your way up to the mausoleum now that you've sort of established that it's safe. And that 24, Leah, did you make that like investigation check for arcane traps?
Zariel Torgan 00:54:03 Yeah, I don't think he did.
Kaladin Shash 00:54:18 I don't see it in the roll log. Oh, there is an Arcana check for 23. That was a while back. It was a while back. Yeah, I don't think for this. Yeah. Hot hot hand.
Dungeon Master 00:54:26 That was from before. Yeah. Investigation check for looking for trap. Natural 20. No traps.
Leopold Magnus 00:54:30 Oh, sorry, did you guys talk to me? Oh, I just got up to talk. Yeah. Oh, hell yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:44 Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:54:47 But we'll say with your guys's perception check and then the investigation check being a natural 20, you pick up something you are going to miss. As you're sort of really investigating, you're like checking into this mist, which is really thick at this spot. You do notice that it seems to be rolling away from this space. So like the mausoleum, the giant buildings, the chapel itself, you see like this mist seems to be starting there and pushing outward into the Don district like.
Dungeon Master 00:55:18 magically summoned perhaps is the first thing that comes to your mind. But that doesn't seem dangerous, you know.
Kaladin Shash 00:55:27 OK. Observation made.
Dungeon Master 00:55:38 I think it's immune to poison or resistant but he's got his face in it and it doesn't start damaging him so it's not dangerous but it does mute your movements a little bit and it's like obscuring vision which is a little odd.
Leopold Magnus 00:55:50 Thanks.
Zariel Torgan 00:55:56 Hmm. So who's going in first?
Kaladin Shash 00:56:00 Then we move up to the entrance, the door, because we have got the key for it.
Dungeon Master 00:56:09 Uh, yeah. You move up. No guards. You go to the big door. It's a simple, like, skeleton key type lock, where it's, um, very basic. Slide it in. Turn it. With a heavy click, just...
Dungeon Master 00:56:27 snaps into place, and you push the door open, stone on these heavy hinges. They're well-oiled, though, so it doesn't squeak as it opens, but the door, just with a slow swing, just opens. You see darkness below you as you descend straight down into the building. It is not like a room down. And then down, it's straight up, you open the door, and there's a staircase that goes into the darkness.
Leopold Magnus 00:56:56 Before we enter, could I tell the omen nights and other groups that were going in.
Dungeon Master 00:57:02 Yeah, you guys on your communications, which, as you remember, the big benefit of them is you only have a limited range to talk to each other, but there is always a direct line to the core. So you can sort of just general line say back to the core, which has been probably a little bit commandeered for this sort of mission.
Dungeon Master 00:57:23 and a
Zariel Torgan 00:57:35 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 00:57:44 Can I tell them that it seems to be of magic origin? Maybe there's something they could do to dispel it. Well, yes, according to my analysis, it appears to be of magic origin.
Dungeon Master 00:57:51 He goes, it's, and you're sure of this? Because we'll get working on that. That's good info.
Kaladin Shash 00:58:03 Yes.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:11 Yeah, let's get down in there. Yeah, I guess I'll go first if nobody's wanting to.
Dungeon Master 00:58:28 You guys move in. Let me make a map real quick for the in-between. I have one for later. But I'll describe it, because the first room is the part that really matters. You guys descend the darkness, careful and wary of traps.
Kaladin Shash 00:58:34 I step right up. I just put my check mark there just waiting for a new map.
Zariel Torgan 00:58:39 Oh shit, yeah, I didn't even move mine. Okay, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:58:58 You don't see any. And then oddly enough, as you continue to descend, you find these cups that are all empty, but there's hundreds of them sort of discarded. You see freshly snuffed candles, some of them still smoking a little bit, most of them fully out. But as you descend into this main room, huge gathering space that's empty,
Kaladin Shash 00:59:11 No.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:19 No.
Dungeon Master 00:59:27 Still not a single soul. Nobody around, but these, again, like turned over stools and these cups. All empty. Go ahead and give me a medicine check or arcana check, but arcana will be harder. 17. You're like,
Leopold Magnus 00:59:38 Is there any residue left in the cups? OK, we'll do the arcana. 17.
Dungeon Master 00:59:57 looking at it, you pick it up, there's a little bit of iridescence on like the film that leaves on your metal gauntlet. You're checking for like you're putting a little bit of magic into it to see if it does anything back and it doesn't seem to be magical more than it is like alchemical.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:18 Hmm. Yeah, I'll, uh. Let me see.
Leopold Magnus 01:00:19 Okay, so is there any creatures, little rats, anything running around down here in this gross dungeon? Or maybe I could ask Zaria to catch me a rat. Probably have much higher nature than me. About a plus four.
Dungeon Master 01:00:27 Give me a major check if you'd like. You can get help on this one.
Kaladin Shash 01:00:30 He's used to living in the core.
Zariel Torgan 01:00:49 I'm just looking to see if I have like a automatic speak with like animal thing. Yeah, I'll just use, you want animal handling or do you want survival? Oh, like tracking or like, oh, galaxy nature. Okay, so can I use survival for that? Because it's significantly better.
Dungeon Master 01:01:02 You have to find something first, so we'll do nature. Yeah, he asked if you could just like a rodent or something, so you have to track down an animal first. Yes. Something you look around and eventually you do see like a small mouse.
Zariel Torgan 01:01:21 Okay. Uh, 17.
Dungeon Master 01:01:32 scurrying on the exact edge of the whole thing, careful to avoid you because it doesn't know you. So just going along the perimeter, and you sort of beckon to it. And being druidic in nature, it does notice you. Was that your animal handling? Go ahead and give me an animal handling to see if you can get it to trust you. 22. Can you speak with animals at this point?
Zariel Torgan 01:01:55 That's going to be 22. Not inherently, no.
Dungeon Master 01:02:07 you sort of just make little squeaking sounds to it, just over and over again. And you seem to be conversing with it, trying to convey the point of like, hey, try this out, pointing to this liquid. And it seems to do the equivalent of a mouse shrug. And then it licks up this little chemical a little bit. But unless you can speak to it, you're just going to be watching what happens. That could be totally what you want to do, too.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:38 Yeah, I didn't prepare to speak with animals, and I can't do it as a little extra action yet. So that's going to be the extent. I have a feeling we need to get moving. If they're gone, we need to hustle. Because if we don't find anybody, we're going to be in deep shit.
Kaladin Shash 01:02:52 Yeah, just get in there. Wait, there's somebody here still, though. It was just the main room. Sure.
Leopold Magnus 01:02:58 I don't think they're gone. I think they're dead. They just Jonestowns themselves up in here. Yeah, yeah, but you know what? What if there was access to a whole bunch of undead corpses? All killed themselves. Mm-hmm. And then there's like one mage hanging around. I'm just gonna like bring him back to life.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:15 You think that they killed themselves? That's an interesting idea. Is Ratshit a cleric? Ratshit, could you do...
Kaladin Shash 01:03:27 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:03:27 But anyways, I mean, like, we need to know if this poison, I think that's an important clue, if it's only gonna take a few seconds. Like if it's too much time, then we can just move on, but.
Dungeon Master 01:03:38 He is, yes. Because that's a good idea, actually. And you see he does, like, one of his senses, he throws out, like, his holy aura, spans the room, and he goes, well, fuck me.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:45 some sort of pulse to see if there's some sort of necrotic energy in this room, like Leo might be thinking.
Dungeon Master 01:04:07 It's odd. It does feel radiant, actually, in coating, but there's something off about it. He looks at you a little concerned. He's like, I'm not entirely sure I like what this means.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:30 that. Oh, shit. Nice map.
Leopold Magnus 01:04:30 We must proceed with the utmost caution. There is magic aloof.
Dungeon Master 01:04:37 You guys keep heading down and it's taking 15 to I just found it online. It's just basic. Just to show you that you're going from like a set room down this like less established area. The the set and sculpted stones that are placed in mortared gradually transition to just like stone walls that have been carved. You're moving through this dark unlit
Dungeon Master 01:05:00 Tunnel system so those of you without dark vision are sort of at a loss relying on the other people on the occasional like. Smoldering of like a torch that's not really late anymore you see release that lead to very small tunnels that don't even really fit people of your size but just go off in the darkness but it's not the main path you don't go down it instantly.
Dungeon Master 01:05:23 You keep making your way, and eventually you hear some chanting in the distance, straight ahead. But it's up to you on if you follow it or you just want to take a break. It's pretty far away. You don't see anybody. I think yours lasts an hour, right? Or a half hour?
Leopold Magnus 01:05:33 Can I cast detect magic? How far ahead are they? Okay, this has a range of 30 feet.
Zariel Torgan 01:05:42 E, do we need to re-up our stealth by now? Or can we use up the old rolls? Or I'm... An hour. Okay. Do we need to re-roll now that we're in a new space? Or... What do you guys think? I think we need to get in there.
Dungeon Master 01:05:54 Yeah, you still have it. If you guys proceed forward, yes.
Kaladin Shash 01:06:05 Yeah, so we're currently we're just in a hallway and we can just hear chanting down the corridor. That's all we know right now. Yeah, that's fine. Let's move forward a little again. 35. So the natural 19 that's pretty nice.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:05 Yeah. Yeah, I kind of want to get close enough and then maybe cast detect magic. So if there's anything going on, I can get a sense for.
Zariel Torgan 01:06:16 Okay. So that's going to be a 30. Jesus. He's still good. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:06:35 Your bath 1020. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:06:39 No. No. Oh, yes, right. You have to take the low number. That's all right. Dirty 20 is good. It's pretty hard right now. That's a two, two. Ah, crit failed. Crit failed. The duality there.
Dungeon Master 01:06:45 Let me see what Ratchet gets. Pull up the sheet. Oh. A 20 and a one. No, he does not.
Zariel Torgan 01:06:48 One. One. I don't know, we got an average of like... What is it, like... 27? Ooh. Ouch. Is he, uh... Does Ratchet have luck? Oh. No.
Leopold Magnus 01:07:05 That's wild. That's hilarious.
Kaladin Shash 01:07:11 Mwa ha ha ha!
Dungeon Master 01:07:15 Uh, it's not his movements that make noise. You guys are pretty far back when you decided to do this, which was good. Uh, the detect match that you throw out doesn't sense anything other than like what he had mentioned earlier. You're getting divine energy without this whole space, but there's something beneath it. Something feels off, but you can't.
Dungeon Master 01:07:42 guess it it's like all intuitive there's just like something in the back of your brain that doesn't feel right and as you're moving something like that but but like there's there's like out of game not a check that you can make that's gonna tell you what it is other than that you sense that it was divine but something isn't right
Leopold Magnus 01:07:47 Does it feel like it's maybe tainted a little bit? Like it's not its full form? Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:08:04 And he apparently didn't have his comms muted. So at first it's like that when your speaker plays sudden loud music that you didn't expect it to in a public space, and you have to like very quickly silence it. There's just this burst of conversation that pops up before he turns it into the quiet setting. And you hear like the commas cutting out a whole bunch. It's like, but you're catching little bits of conversation as Sylvaris goes, anybody who could pick this up?
Dungeon Master 01:08:33 It was a trap. We're fucking surrounded. And it cuts out again. He goes, send somebody. And then he cuts out. You don't hear from him again. And then you hear Kip and Levi go, holy shit, it's the whole fucking town's coming alive. He goes, boys, this is this is crazy. There's holy there's there's thousands and maybe a little bit of an exaggeration. But he as like from what he is saying is he's reporting it live. He's going that they all came out of nowhere. It's like they stepped out of the fucking shadows.
Dungeon Master 01:09:03 They're just walking down the street in unison. We're going to keep low for now, but this is huge. And the chanting ahead of you gets a little bit louder as this all goes on at the same time. Sylvaris goes dark for a second. You don't hear anything, but Levi is keeping you in the loop as he's just sort of giving you a detailed in-time recap of what's going on like this.
Dungeon Master 01:09:34 Huge crowd sort of just came out of nowhere in the mist and seems to be walking towards the chapels. Did you guys stay and watch it? We'll say about this time, Zariel, you feel like a sudden thrashing in your pocket.
Leopold Magnus 01:09:42 Jonathan, did we get a read on what happened to the mouse? Who did the mouse lick that stuff up? I would have liked to. I don't know.
Zariel Torgan 01:09:47 Can I just have picked him up and put him in my pocket that I usually put flowers in?
Dungeon Master 01:10:04 is this mouse has started to trip out, and you see that it's attacking the flowers and biting their heads off. But it seems afraid almost. You pick it up and you pin it so that it can't bite you, and you look in it, and the pupils of its little eyes are enormous. And it's obviously on some hallucinogenic dissociative chemical that's making it see things.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:33 Um, okay, so I've got the detect magic still up, like, is there something going on with him in that way? Or is it maybe more like the herbs and things he's taking? That was the same feeling. Okay, great.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:33 Hmm. So yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:10:45 Again, it's not arcane. You sussed out from it that it's a chemical. It's like a liquid. It's not magical.
Kaladin Shash 01:10:54 That's good, so these guys just drank crack. The whole cult drank crack. I have no proficiency at potion making or. What would be?
Leopold Magnus 01:10:59 Yeah, yeah, yeah, they got they got kind of cracked out. I'm just wondering, do any of us have maybe an ability to determine an antidote to this? Like, we have a little bit of the residual poison, like maybe we could use like a medicine check to. Yeah, I've got a plus zero medicine, so it's not helpful.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:03 I think... Yeah. Just... Yeah, I think out of game, the only thing that makes sense to me as a player is that...
Zariel Torgan 01:11:30 there is some sort of like hub controlling a bunch of like hive mind people so i think we our best bet is to get in there and fuck shit up and yeah yeah shut down whatever's going on yeah i i think if they're getting murked up there we need to hustle before they start doing some real damage up there
Kaladin Shash 01:11:34 Yeah. Yeah. We press in. We shut it down from the inside. Yeah, I think that's exactly what's said. Yeah. Yeah, we we there's obviously like they're already outnumbered. We should move forward with haste. I don't think. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:43 All right, let's do it then. Yeah, that's a good point. Don't worry, boys. Laser, laser, and taser going down.
Dungeon Master 01:12:02 You guys had a pretty good average overall. You know, at least one number in a 30 cancels out on that one. You're sort of hustling. The chaining gets a little bit louder, and eventually you see light towards the end of this space as you sort of move up. Do you guys enter? You see it goes into a big room.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:02 Yeah. Can we move with as much haste as we can, given our stealthy stuff, or is our crit fail a crit fail?
Dungeon Master 01:12:32 But you can do a little bit of prep if you want to right before you get in there.
Kaladin Shash 01:12:39 Uh, I think I'm. They can locate just to enter. I don't think I would cast a spell yet. Yep.
Leopold Magnus 01:12:49 Yep, I'm there too.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:50 Yeah. Yeah, I think I'd want to wait and see what I've got going on. Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:13:01 You see Ratchet behind you, and he goes, well, I think this is where it gets pretty hairy. He'll stand right in the sort of the center of all of you, and he'll throw in a blast. So that you guys all get a D4 to it. Saving rolls end. You enter the space, and we'll set the scene of what you see.
Dungeon Master 01:13:33 You come into this huge cavern as the doorways open. There's not a real top to the building you enter. You find that it's a chapel, broken, no top of the building, no windows that are in touch, with the exception of a stained glass at the far end. The air is thick. There is a stillness as you step into this vast shadow expanse.
Leopold Magnus 01:13:34 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:14:03 Faint flickers of dim, cold light cast in multiple sconces and portraits. This place seems pretty forgotten by time other than the few people in this space, but other than that, it seems as though somebody is holding their breath. Everything is bleeding. At the end of the chapel, you see a weathered altar covered in dust and cobwebs.
Leopold Magnus 01:14:04 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:14:26 There's a cloaked figure, his robe simple and tattered, hanging loosely over his lithe and thin form. A hood obscures his face, but he's not even facing towards you. He's facing away, kneeling, praying to this large stained-glass window. The only sound in the chamber is this low, rhythmic chant that slips from his and the other's lips, who sort of are on the borders of this room.
Dungeon Master 01:14:54 This figure's hands move with a purpose, up and down, tracing arcane symbols, sending them out in different directions. Everything around him glows faintly and then dims, then glows and then dims. As you sort of step into this space, everything sort of quiets and the chanting stops. The figure pauses. He turns to you, standing, taking off his hood, and standing in front of you is a familiar figure.
Dungeon Master 01:15:24 an elderly man with balding gray hair carrying large prayer beads at his side. You see Father Kalor is standing there. He looks, his face let down, hardened. He goes, when I first saw you, I thought maybe you would join.
Zariel Torgan 01:15:28 Uh-oh. Bastard.
Kaladin Shash 01:15:36 Yep.
Dungeon Master 01:15:53 You meet the right people, you see our purpose. You've caused nothing but trouble for me. I'll spot you for that. I'll give you one chance. Hear me out. Hear what I have to say. I beg.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:16 I'll hear him out. Villains never get to monologue. As a DM, I'm very into this.
Dungeon Master 01:16:24 Looks down, he shuffles a little bit. This world has forgotten its roots. Yeah, go ahead. You see, he looks and he notices this, as there's suddenly three of you, three more of you. He begins again, his voice echoing in this cavernous space, tinged with sadness that belies the fervor in his eyes.
Kaladin Shash 01:16:27 As he's talking, I'm just going to cast a mirror image just so that that's just set up. Because that's just going to be like a whole turn of listening.
Dungeon Master 01:16:53 We've stopped caring about the world outside of this damned dome. We shield ourselves from the powers that gifted us life. We have turned from the true power that once guided us in search of the magic created by men. But I have not forgotten. I serve a god from a different age. A god who was forced into submission and obedience with an altered form. One who will
Dungeon Master 01:17:22 Under my guidance, cleanse this world of its sins and its failures. I serve Teo, God of Wrath. And if you guys recall, a quick memory pops into your head of an offhand comment thrown out by Leo when you walked into the bar. Having hit it right on the nose, this cult follows a god that no longer exists as far as anybody knows.
Zariel Torgan 01:17:28 Ugh.
Dungeon Master 01:17:51 This cult follows the supposed half-form of Viteo, the wrath side, before they were merged into one being when they ascended to godhood. He looks out. His words hang heavy in the air. Everything sort of pulses and subsides. Go ahead and give me- everybody can give me a perception check as he keeps talking. Perception check.
Kaladin Shash 01:18:10 Does Bless go on checks as well, or is it just saves and an attack? OK.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:14 to cleanse. Huh? Oh. Pretty good.
Dungeon Master 01:18:33 Saving throws an attack. You guys don't get the extra stuff. Pretty good roll. No, it's not. You see the whole room sort of vibrates with his words. And he looks down at you. Shakes his head a bit. Yes.
Kaladin Shash 01:18:41 Okay, okay.
Leopold Magnus 01:18:43 Yeah, pretty good.
Zariel Torgan 01:18:45 23 is not good enough. Oh.
Dungeon Master 01:19:03 I've said what I've said. You're with me or you are against us. Which is it?
Zariel Torgan 01:19:14 So, out of game. He hasn't really pitched us anything other than he follows the God of Wrath and they're going to cleanse the sin of man.
Kaladin Shash 01:19:26 Yeah, we should just be getting ready to just engage in a great fight. Cause there's no other, there's nobody else around. It was just stalling. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:19:31 It may take an insane insight roll to just realize that he is, he is like a fanatic, he is very into this cause, but you haven't heard of Tao being an independent being? That was just some crazy lore that you guys had stumbled onto, as like the former half of the god, one of the gods of the Prime Pantheon. Who just grabbed him?
Zariel Torgan 01:19:59 Oh, sorry. I was just trying to see how far away he was. I didn't know I could move him. So grabby.
Kaladin Shash 01:20:03 Why are you grabbing him?
Leopold Magnus 01:20:03 So, Jonathan, and I'm assuming in this world, right, where you have the Tao, like Tao and the other God, right? Like Va, Va and Tao, that idea of like, kind of similar yin and yang exists, like that idea of balance exists in the world.
Dungeon Master 01:20:16 Mm-hmm. Jaw and tail, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Interesting.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:30 It would seem to me like the options are that this guy is worshipping a betrayer god of some kind that's passing itself off as a legitimate god, and that's how he's getting his powers. Or that maybe he's right, but Va isn't really an option. And so I think either way, we got to fuck this guy up. All right.
Kaladin Shash 01:20:51 Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:53 Yeah, I'll stand up and I'll say, well, I don't know too much, but I do know things should be in balance. And I don't believe that Tao would enjoy sitting on top of the throne alone. So I'm sorry, but I'm against you.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:12 Before we get too crazy, the two guys on either side, are they wearing what they look like they're wearing? Or are they got something else going on? They just look like full plate.
Dungeon Master 01:21:25 I forget what I put in for them. Do they look like just monks? Oh yeah, they were like battle clerics or something. No, they're just in like thick robes. I just wanted some bald monk-ass looking people.
Leopold Magnus 01:21:29 They look kind of like, yeah, hopefully they have a little head cap on.
Kaladin Shash 01:21:45 Yeah. So we're all initially.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:48 So I would like to, do we have another action before combat, or is this kind of it? OK. All right. I'm ready to rock. Should we roll initiative? OK.
Dungeon Master 01:21:56 It's all kind of happening at the same time. Yeah. Because as you guys sort of obviously don't instantly join him, he looks at you. And with one last phrase, he goes, fine. If I must, I will guide you to the truth. And he raises his hand, preparing to release some sort of spell at you. Everybody go ahead and roll initiative, obviously.
Leopold Magnus 01:22:03 Yeah. Damn, I forgot that we haven't long rested. That's not going to be good.
Kaladin Shash 01:22:33 I'm you. Were you down significant things? I was only down like a first level spell slot and then I just. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:22:37 You haven't done anything this day, have you? I wonder if you hadn't reset yourself from a previous date, because you guys really only did one thing.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:40 Yeah, I haven't done anything either. Oh, you charmed and... Yeah, all I've done is...
Leopold Magnus 01:22:43 I have one first level spell and one second level spell, so I'm not exactly sure. But yeah, I charmed. I'm not sure what else I did. I may have done some other stuff too. Yeah, so I did the...
Kaladin Shash 01:23:01 Very cool. And I've only cast mirror image today.
Leopold Magnus 01:23:08 I don't know, I definitely know I would have charmed him, and then I just cast Detect Magic, so I'm not sure what the third level, or the third spell slot meant. And I don't know about the second level one. Oh, four, level four.
Zariel Torgan 01:23:26 What level does this say you are? Okay. All right. Maybe just.
Kaladin Shash 01:23:31 School.
Leopold Magnus 01:23:35 I was gonna say, I don't know, do you remember? It's been so long, I don't remember when I would have used spells other than the Charming and then the Tech Magic I just casted today. Okay. Yeah, I'll just say I've used two first level spell slots.
Dungeon Master 01:23:42 I think that should have been it, so go ahead and if you need to reset it to reflect that, go for it. OK, so we've got Leopold up first
Leopold Magnus 01:24:05 Okay, I'm ready to roll. Oh yeah, if you have music, I should pop it. Man, I always forget.
Dungeon Master 01:24:12 an 18, and then Zariel's got a 14, Kaladin's got an 8. I have to put this in my other track too. I do. Have you guys joined it? You guys haven't had it this whole time? Damn.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:24 Do you have music going? Oh, there we go. Rex, did that just say your name was R. Putnam?
Kaladin Shash 01:24:29 Yeah, i'm i'm in i'm in spotify dude, he's full battle music right now. He already he already got it going Wasn't it
Leopold Magnus 01:24:37 No, that's one of my favorite parts. I just forgot. I'm sorry. That's what I needed. Yeah. No, no, that's just my last name is Putnam. Yeah, isn't that hilarious?
Dungeon Master 01:24:45 You guys missed the eerie stuff beforehand. Like the high school, that's really funny.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:55 Are you from Rex Putnam? Jesus Christ, your name's Rex Putnam? That's great. That's great. OK. All right, I'm ready to rock. Sorry. Yeah, we need to move.
Leopold Magnus 01:25:07 Yeah, exactly. So let's see, my go first. Yeah, what's the distance? Let me measure that. OK, yeah, I didn't notice that. Let's see, my movement.
Kaladin Shash 01:25:19 We are deep in range here. These guys are about 120 feet each. And then the main guy is even way further.
Zariel Torgan 01:25:30 Yeah, we need to move.
Leopold Magnus 01:25:37 30 feet. That would be putting me out in the open. I'm going to move here. Let me move there. So within 30 feet, I'm going to try and talk up. Is this like a altar or something that I'd be able to get some amount of cover from?
Dungeon Master 01:26:06 Yeah, that's a pretty big object. Looks like an old stone coffin not being used or anything, just like ornamental for the space. 80 feet to those guys and a little bit farther to the high cleric.
Leopold Magnus 01:26:08 OK. Well, so I'm going to try and take cover behind that, and hopefully that will limit sight to two of the guys and just only the one. And then this guy is. And he's far, he's he's 80 feet away.
Leopold Magnus 01:26:37 Okay, yeah, the only thing I can do is I'll use a cantrip. I'll do a firebolt to attack one right in front of me. Ah, shit. Last is a plus D4. Oh, come on. 10. Oh, man.
Dungeon Master 01:26:48 Go for it. Mm-hmm. A 10 just misses. Fargo's screaming and hits the stone behind him. What else you got?
Zariel Torgan 01:26:59 Oh no.
Leopold Magnus 01:27:08 And then you can't use as a bonus action another spell, right? Yeah, I was going to say, I do have a bonus action to do the magic stone, to pull it up, but that would be two spells. Unless that specific magic stone is a bonus action.
Dungeon Master 01:27:16 No, not if, uh, well, if you have a bonus action spell, um, she can only be cantrip and spelled on the same turn. That would work. If magic stone is a cantrip, right? So it's cantrip, cantrip. That's fine.
Leopold Magnus 01:27:38 I'll cast Magic Stone to pull up the 3 stones. And with that, that'll be my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:27:56 All righty. Which one is it? That's the other one that didn't go after you. He has 30 feet of movement. And if he makes his way halfway down, he'll burn 34 and he'll just get
Dungeon Master 01:28:25 He'll just run forward at you guys. That'll be his turn. Zariel, you are up next.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:35 Alright, I would like to cast Flaming Sphere at 2nd level. So I drop Pass Without a Trace, cast Flaming Sphere right on top of the guy that just moved up. And that's a dex 14 to save on that.
Dungeon Master 01:29:00 Any creature that ends its turn within five feet of the spear must make a dexterity saving throw. Yeah. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:29:07 Oh, I'll have to use it as a bonus action to slam it. So it appears, but it doesn't do any damage yet. Okay, okay. And then, all right. And then I want to bonus into my wild shape. I'd like it to be giant bear.
Dungeon Master 01:29:31 OK. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:29:34 And so that bear has 40 feet of movement. Can I get to him with that? Let me just get the ruler. So 17. It says he's 36 feet away from me if I take an angle. Okay, I'd like to get around with the extra couple feet around the back like this. Oops. I'd like to get right there if I can.
Zariel Torgan 01:30:09 And that's my full turn. That's action bonus and movement.
Dungeon Master 01:30:20 is the other guy, he will use 30-ish feet of movement. I don't think he has long-range stuff. He's just, oh, you see, he pulls out a hand crossbow, and he chose to shoot the beer. That's all he can do. Well, I guess, how close are you, Leo? 50?
Zariel Torgan 01:30:39 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:47 Uh, that's probably yeah, let me. That may be a. Yes, 45 or 50 feet. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:30:53 um he's got a hundred with disadvantage so he'll just shoot at you with disadvantage
Dungeon Master 01:31:27 With a natural one, he misses. That'll be his turn. Alan, you are up. Large stone coffins. Yes, if you'd like to. But they do offer some cover if you need it.
Leopold Magnus 01:31:29 Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:31:30 And what what are the objects right in front of us? Those are like tall bookshelves or those like waist high. OK, OK, so we can see over them just fine. Excellent.
Zariel Torgan 01:31:30 Oof.
Kaladin Shash 01:32:02 Yeah, perfect. Um, I'm going to, I'm going to go ahead and take aim at the monk that's approaching, uh, Leopold and go ahead and cast fire bolt on him. Well, oh, well maybe 10 doesn't, doesn't get there. 10 doesn't get there.
Dungeon Master 01:32:13 Go for it. Nine misses unless you have that. Ten misses. This guy is so dexterous. He's done two Matrix dodges. Chuckles to himself.
Zariel Torgan 01:32:24 UGH!
Kaladin Shash 01:32:36 That's about right. I'll take my movement to get forward and sort of crouch behind this large coffin. And that'll be, that'll be my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:32:53 Okay. Uh, up next is ratchet Donnie. He's going to take cover in this sort of edge where he can peek out if he needs to. He's just going to be a fuck, fuck, fuck. What do I do? What do I do? Um, he's still concentrating on bless. So he will, uh, he looks, neither of them have taken damage yet. Have they, uh,
Kaladin Shash 01:33:24 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 01:33:27 He'll throw out... He'll just do... Who hasn't gone? He runs up behind you, Leo, and he'll touch you on the back shoulder. He goes, don't fuck this next one up, and he'll give you guidance for your next action.
Leopold Magnus 01:33:58 Awesome.
Dungeon Master 01:33:58 And then he just ducks back, not wanting to do too much at this point. This guy needs at least one HP, what's going on? Next is Father Kalor. He sort of feebly sort of stumbles down the stairs a little bit. As I knew you'd be trouble.
Dungeon Master 01:34:25 holds out his hand and he releases that guiding bolt that he had prepped. Go ahead and in your bear form, I believe it's to hit. What is your bear's AC? Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:34:41 12. All right.
Dungeon Master 01:34:58 Blade at 12, he hits you. Now you take 46 radiant damage. Not 40, 4. You take 8 points of radiant damage as it hits you. The Guiding Beads, guys, chill.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:08 Say 40 with an F. Oh. It's a big daddy. It's like, oh my God.
Kaladin Shash 01:35:09 Whoa, boy Wow, it sounded like 48. I was like man father Father colors not fucking around
Dungeon Master 01:35:28 But you are glimmering with radiant energy that strikes you and outlines you for a moment. Leo, it's your turn again.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:38 Nah, he's fucking my shit up. Alright.
Leopold Magnus 01:35:46 Yeah, so from where I'm at, I'm gonna remain hidden kind of behind this coffin, but I'm gonna, with, I think he's within 60 feet, let me check. Yeah. With Witch Bolt, at the first level, I am going to target the Monk Knight closest to me.
Kaladin Shash 01:36:12 Plus plus. Those stack, right? Sweet.
Leopold Magnus 01:36:16 And the guidance is a 1d4? Ah, plus plus. OK, so that's a 12, and then 2d4. Cool. So 18 to hit on that. Which bolt? So he will take 1d12. Hell yeah. He takes 12 damage. So the antenna kind of projects from the back of my armor.
Dungeon Master 01:36:20 Yep. Yep. You have 2d4 on whatever you roll. 12 already hit. You blow this guy out of water. The lightning.
Zariel Torgan 01:36:38 Nice. Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:36:45 Yeah, it strikes up in the air, arcs super high, and then lands, striking him really precisely, hits him to the top of the head, and his whole body seizes, and he falls forward unconscious.
Leopold Magnus 01:36:59 It's over, father! Give up while you still can! And I'll lean out just enough to launch a magic stone at the other guy, um, who Zariel is parrying, as a bonus action. 16, I think, 22 would hit. Sounds like it would hit, right?
Dungeon Master 01:37:26 Point of two hits. You take out this guy as well. Knocks the left side of the head, falls unconscious.
Leopold Magnus 01:37:31 eight damage on that stone. Oh, Jesus. Uh, well, remember. Okay. Now I'm going to intentionally switch to doing non-lethal damage to the father.
Kaladin Shash 01:37:37 Get out of here. These guys are like little feathers. That was all non-lethal. They just took him to zero and we like stabilized him with the cuff. Done. You took him to zero and then we
Zariel Torgan 01:37:53 What? I thought that was all non-lethal damage. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:37:59 Oh, oh man, I thought I just fried that guy like an egg. But yeah, I guess if we're. Got it OK. Right, yeah, that's that's the idea.
Kaladin Shash 01:38:07 We cuffed him. Right? OK, but that's OK, but that's the idea, right? Even if we get into zero, the cuffs are stabilizers, muter of ability. He's going to bring him up. Let's go.
Dungeon Master 01:38:09 This one's not passive, so these guys haven't been cuffed, so you haven't been able to get to them.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:27 I got a bad feeling about this, you guys. All right. I would like to take my 40 feet of movement as a bear
Leopold Magnus 01:38:32 Yeah, considering we just smoked those two guys so easily. Yeah, yeah. Oh, nothing. Oh, nothing.
Kaladin Shash 01:38:36 Let's go. He's like, please make them dead. What? What?
Dungeon Master 01:38:42 What are you guys talking about? What do you mean?
Zariel Torgan 01:38:57 to get as close to him as I can. Get right about there. And I can move my flaming sphere 30 feet as a bonus action. Right about there. And that is my full turn. Actually, if I don't burn my action as a bear, I can get further. So I can double my distance. So I'm going to go another 40, which puts me right
Dungeon Master 01:39:18 Okay. Ending your turn, Kaladin.
Kaladin Shash 01:39:25 Yes, let's see.
Zariel Torgan 01:39:28 right there. And then that's my full turn.
Kaladin Shash 01:39:51 Are those large fire braziers? Is that something you could take cover behind? Yeah. That's alright. Man, I think my movements only 30. Yep, only 30. Yeah, I guess I'll I'll go ahead
Dungeon Master 01:40:00 the ones sort of more in the center. At best, you could probably get half cover.
Kaladin Shash 01:40:21 I'm gonna hurdle over the coffin for my movement and then I'll use my action to dash. No, no, no, I'll just use my movement. Can you hear me? Okay, yeah. I'll move forward and then I'm just gonna use another fireball. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:40:34 Ready already. Yeah. To the father. Enroll.
Kaladin Shash 01:40:51 because I'm at 108 feet now. Gosh. 15 to hit? Okay, 11. Oh goodness.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:05 Hmm. You guys, this is, we're in the wrong chapel. We just, we just walked in on some dude seven bro time. We're like the ink. Oh,
Dungeon Master 01:41:08 11 hits him. He's just a frail old man. Go ahead and roll damage. Eight. It's a heavy hit to him. His cloak's been smoking and smoldering at the shoulder. He's out.
Kaladin Shash 01:41:22 Eight fire damage. Uh, no, I don't.
Dungeon Master 01:41:37 sort of reeks out, shouts out in pain, not out though, sort of recoils, grabs it, hunched forward, anything else? You can give me another perception check if you'd like.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:49 I don't know. Hmm.
Kaladin Shash 01:41:52 I don't see anything else unusual within the temple itself. Yeah, let's... Nope, I don't see anything. I'm going real soft.
Dungeon Master 01:42:13 Uh, well in the room nine isn't horrible. Um, these like faces in the corners of the room are actually, you see like outlets, like they go into tunnels. Like this is a center point for, uh, like a tunnel system, but that's all you get with a nine, not super detailed.
Kaladin Shash 01:42:32 All right, that's OK. That's my turn.
Dungeon Master 01:42:41 You see, uh, Donnie pops up and he goes, Oh, what, what, what do, how the fuck do I help? I don't have the range for that. Ah, shit. He.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:50 Kill this old man!
Dungeon Master 01:43:11 We'll move up to Kaladin. And he's going to cast... He doesn't have anything, so he'll just... He'll either give you guidance or he'll hold his action
Dungeon Master 01:43:41 But he doesn't have a ranged spell that can get to the cleric. Okay. You see he sort of stays back a little bit then for some cover from the other area. And he's sort of just waiting. It's the father's turn again. Pissed. Because I don't understand why it's so hard for you to let me have my moment.
Kaladin Shash 01:43:45 Hold an action. Maybe something will come out of the tunnel.
Dungeon Master 01:44:12 text it a dagger and she's gonna stab the bear as he comes towards you oh shit 19
Zariel Torgan 01:44:17 Cool. Full Revenant. Yeah. It's fucking me up.
Dungeon Master 01:44:43 Oh, that didn't, hold on. Will it roll damage if I just click that? Hell yeah. It's getting smarter. It's learning our mistakes. Two points of piercing damage. And he's just shouting, rawr! At you. Leo, it's your turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:56 Mmm.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:07 Yeah, I'll step out from behind my full cover. Standing in the middle of the room. I'll kind of erect myself in my fullest towering form and say, it's over old man. We've bested you. Give up now while you still can. No response.
Dungeon Master 01:45:37 Eat my ass! Alrighty.
Kaladin Shash 01:45:41 Thank you very much.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:41 Well, I came here to do two things. Chew bubblegum, and I spit it out on the floor, and there's just a lump of chewy tar. And kill old people. And I just ran out of bubblegum. And I spin up a firebolt and launch it at him. Well,
Zariel Torgan 01:45:42 Oh shit. We're gonna get in trouble for this, guys. Oh no.
Leopold Magnus 01:46:07 hit. Do I need a d4? Okay, 12 hits. And I extend my arm up and it kind of emerges a glowing fireball and it spins up with some power and launches downrange. Seven damage.
Dungeon Master 01:46:08 It hits him, slow motion. As he goes backwards, everything sort of stops as he stops moving. His body catches in midair, starts convulsing and shaking.
Dungeon Master 01:46:38 as light starts to sort of seep out of different spaces first from just his joints and then light explodes out of his mouth and through his nose and out of his eyes he just keeps vibrating and convulsing faster and faster and faster everything like starts shaking and his body twists and morphs and expands and then
Dungeon Master 01:47:03 His body physically explodes in bear form. You are knocked to the bottom of the steps as you get flung back as you see the true form of this figure is revealed. No, if I'm going to force movie and then you're not going to take damage. Not anymore.
Leopold Magnus 01:47:19 Oh, dear. Oh, he's just got a machine gun. It's like packing an LMG.
Zariel Torgan 01:47:21 Do I take any damage on that? Okay. Is this true form invisible? Oh, shit! Do you have a gun? Oh, it's a bird. Okay. I just thought I saw him with, like, a gun. Oh, shit.
Kaladin Shash 01:47:41 Uh huh.
Dungeon Master 01:47:43 You see this angelic being stands up and the ground quakes below him. He straightens his shoulders and sets, and you hear a loud pop as he sets himself, cracking his neck. His wings expand and then come back. And he goes, be it as you may, I still must kill you. And he floats up as the reverend takes his place in battle.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:13 Okay, now go ahead. So I still had a half of my turn left. Yeah, and I just have a bonus action. So I guess basically all that's left.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:13 You know, on my. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:48:14 Okay, that was the guy they were talking about.
Dungeon Master 01:48:23 Yes, it's still your turn.
Leopold Magnus 01:48:40 Is magic stone because I can't really do anything else. Okay. So yeah, I will uh, I will just say oh dear Do we have something else on our hands here boys, and I just kind of point like Check it out uh and uh And i'll launch a magic stone Yeah
Kaladin Shash 01:48:56 What is the point for? Oh. Oh.
Zariel Torgan 01:49:03 I didn't see that. Oh, shit.
Leopold Magnus 01:49:06 I just want to make sure you guys all catch it and it will be a natural 20. And so I'll just kind of like one of the stones will stop floating above me, hover and just take off. You don't even really see a stone. It's just like a, you know, a little silenced that you see the airwaves maybe. And it'll do 15 damage with the magic stone.
Dungeon Master 01:49:13 Nice! We'll double your damage. Nice!
Zariel Torgan 01:49:33 Jesus Christ.
Kaladin Shash 01:49:36 That's it, man.
Leopold Magnus 01:49:39 That's a pretty good bonus action. And then I'll kind of like, maybe get down, kind of kneel down a little bit. My gear's whirling. That's the end of my turn. I gotta say, I love this song. It's one of the best Star Wars. I'm just thinking of Qui-Gon, man. Well, Obi-Wan's wedding.
Dungeon Master 01:49:55 Righty. Yeah, found an epic version of it I had to throw in. Layer action 15. You see the Reverend floats up, his eyes emblazoned in light. He goes,
Zariel Torgan 01:50:04 Nice. Oh no.
Kaladin Shash 01:50:11 Oh, I was worried about that.
Dungeon Master 01:50:20 four on one is hardly fair and with his hand he holds it out and not making sense because he is wielding divine radiant magic you see sort of like darkness throw from his hands the two bodies that you had previously dropped rise up as these monsters sort of shed the form of these
Kaladin Shash 01:50:43 What do we see? Yeah, there it is. Oh, yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:50:49 Previous monks.
Leopold Magnus 01:51:03 It's pretty spooky when you zoom in. Mr. Bones here.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:08 Oh, yeah. Now, I don't want to be a rules lawyer, but if he's raising dead, don't they have to be dead? Because we did do non-lethal damage.
Dungeon Master 01:51:17 And then that'll be the lair action, it's the raised dead. Initiative count 14, Zariel, it is your turn. It wasn't a raised dead. It was just a fun battle mechanic.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:39 Oh, that's okay. I wasn't being serious. I think this is nice. Okay, how high is he in the air? You said he floated. Is he just on his toes, or...? Okay. I would like to use the rest of my movement to get into his space. Oh, shit. I can only get to there. Is that close enough to be able to make an attack?
Dungeon Master 01:51:49 He's like 10 feet, like he hasn't actually used movement yet that was more flavor. Yeah, that's fine.
Zariel Torgan 01:52:14 I'd like to make two claw attacks. Let's see. 14.
Dungeon Master 01:52:38 14 misses. So with your 25 hits, yeah, just a 14 go up. 15 does not hit.
Zariel Torgan 01:52:42 Let me see if I can get that 14 to hit. All right. 15? Okay. Just one claw damage. It's going to be 13 slashing damage.
Dungeon Master 01:53:11 13 slash damage. Gotcha, gotcha. See, this is where we get to see my dice work.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:13 And then I'd like to take the Sphere of Fire and slide it over with my bonus action. And I'd like to use the ram on the Flaming Sphere as a bonus action. And he makes a DC 14 deck save.
Dungeon Master 01:53:40 He doesn't have a deck safe thing, so we'll go that. Oh, it rolled the shelf for some reason. Can I send it to you guys? No. It's a 19. Okay.
Kaladin Shash 01:53:57 Great.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:59 He does not take any damage. Oh, no, he takes half damage. So that's gonna be... Yeah, that was so funny. I thought these dice were gonna stay cocked. I've never seen that before. It sat there cocked for, like, four seconds. Okay. How does that work? Okay, so at nine...
Dungeon Master 01:54:20 Nice. So half of nine or is nine half? Two. Doesn't like it, but does damage.
Leopold Magnus 01:54:21 That's happened to me before. It's really, I feel like, ah.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:30 No, no, half of nine, so it's four. And that's my turn. Movement action bonus.
Dungeon Master 01:54:51 Nice after you will be. Which one is this on? This guy over here, this undead soldier. What is his movement? You wish. Speed 30 feet. You can get just into Leopold space.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:04 one.
Dungeon Master 01:55:21 And he will take, uh, he doesn't get advantage on anything. He gets three attacks, uh, with one of his weapons. So he'll take long sword attacks on you. First one, 30, 20 to hit. Why is that not going to everybody?
Zariel Torgan 01:55:43 I'm getting Ratchet's custom rolls, but I mean, they're not showing anything. Oh, they just came through. Jesus Christ.
Kaladin Shash 01:55:46 Yeah. Right. Right. So let's take a roll this up. There it goes. It came. It just came through. 15. Sweet.
Leopold Magnus 01:55:47 Yeah. Yeah. Mrs. Yeah, it's really. Yep.
Dungeon Master 01:55:49 Oh, his pages. OK, let me close hit. I had to close his page. Yeah, 3022 hit. Misses your AC so high. Natural one. Misses that one. Eight is going to miss.
Dungeon Master 01:56:25 Not a great showing. Kaladin, your turn.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:25 All right. Nice.
Kaladin Shash 01:56:33 Yes, I would like to go ahead and move into a flanking position and attack this guy with my spear. I'll use the pointy end.
Dungeon Master 01:57:04 Ignore that. These guys, yes, no, it doesn't.
Kaladin Shash 01:57:08 That's fine. Does a 14 hit? OK, cool. Let's see. I don't have a lot of bonus action economy right now. Nope.
Dungeon Master 01:57:33 Uh, so nothing else then, no movement, no other movement or anything like that? Okay... Uh, it is Ratchet's turn. He's gonna say... Right, uh... Who can I help here? He'll move up, and he can... He does have some close-range spells.
Dungeon Master 01:58:14 Let's take it forever to load. I had to close this page not to confuse the dice. He will do. Can he angle it? He will just do. Doesn't want to break concentration. He'll do.
Zariel Torgan 01:58:19 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 01:58:44 a shatter. And he'll try to put it just on the edge to miss both of you and just to get the very corner of it. He sort of places it, throws it out, it'll be a constitution save from the soldier. With a natural 3 it fails, so it'll take 3d8 damage.
Dungeon Master 01:59:21 Nine points of damage to that one. Where is he at? That one. Okay. At the very bottom with initiative count three, it is the Reverend's turn. He, what is he, can he do?
Dungeon Master 01:59:55 He will.
Dungeon Master 02:00:03 I didn't build him with spells, funny enough. Alrighty, you see he reaches his hand up in the air towards the stained glass and invisible at the time, but at the very center of it, sort of embedded in the frame, you see this weapon start to sort of shake and then shatter out of it as he summons his sword into his hands. The blade broken in a few spots, but sort of hovering as if it was connected, but you can see the gap physically between it.
Dungeon Master 02:00:30 And he takes this huge sword, and he'll just swing it at you. He can do two attacks. First one is a 15 to hit. 15, okay. And then the second one is a dirty 20 to hit. 14 plus 6. Okay. I didn't say he was doing it with two hands, so it's a D8 plus 3 on each of those, but he does
Zariel Torgan 02:00:42 Yeah. Yeah, both it. Hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:01:00 48 radiant damage on top of that.
Dungeon Master 02:01:23 In total, you take 43 points of damage. Even though he technically attacks twice, it's one huge swing of his sword. It hits you and it explodes in light as the blade embeds itself into you. You hear this huge thunderous sound as it makes impact. A heavy hit out of it. And then...
Zariel Torgan 02:01:23 Ooh. All right, I drop Bear Form and take 11 points of damage.
Dungeon Master 02:01:50 Ooh. He then uses his Battlefield Rejection. He chooses up to three creatures he can see within 30 feet, so it's just you. And he will give you, essentially, Bane until the end of your next turn. So you'll get a negative d4 to everything. And that is his turn. At the start of round initiative count 20,
Zariel Torgan 02:02:01 Okay. All right.
Dungeon Master 02:02:20 Kaladin, roll me a d4. A d4. Uno. At the top of the round, you guys are in the middle of this fight that just started. Your speaking runes all go off at the same time.
Kaladin Shash 02:02:26 Just a D4. Uno.
Dungeon Master 02:02:49 And you hear Captain Levi going, update, we've tracking the people. They seem to be focusing mostly on the townsfolk. I fear that this is a diversion, though. There's reports that something's going on at the Corps as well. All available soldiers to the Corps. And that's all that happens on the one. Leopold, it is your turn.
Leopold Magnus 02:03:15 Well, what do you say, boys? Should we get back to the core, or should I teach these fellas a lesson? I don't ever have a problem showing people why they named me Bone Crusher. And I reach out for this guy, and I do a ray of frost.
Zariel Torgan 02:03:26 I think this is where it's all coming from. I think we need to take this guy out.
Kaladin Shash 02:03:38 But.
Dungeon Master 02:03:48 for it. Is that a hit or is it a save? Usually Rays are, what is the hit? 18 hit. Now do you avoid hitting Kaladin with it? You can
Leopold Magnus 02:03:52 Uh, let's see. I thought it might have been to hit. Yeah, it's a it's a ranged spell. OK. And so. Yeah, I'm gonna I'm just going to kind of step maybe off to his shoulders so I can just blast this guy clean through. Yeah, and.
Dungeon Master 02:04:18 Angle it, yeah. No, you had done 8 damage the first time. Yeah, you rolled the 8.
Leopold Magnus 02:04:24 Oh, I guess I already rolled. I didn't do that on purpose, but you want to take the eight or do you want to? OK. Cool. So, yeah, for my action, I'll do the ray of frost on that guy and then I'll do my bonus action. I'll spin up a stone. This will be my second stone and I will
Leopold Magnus 02:04:52 attack him as well. Oh yes, third stone. This will be the last one I have, unless I cast it again later. But I have Guidance and Bless, so I don't know if that matters.
Kaladin Shash 02:04:53 you.
Dungeon Master 02:04:56 This would be your third stone, right? You used one on the monk, you crit on the reverend, and this is the third. You do have... You don't have guidance this round. You used your guidance, but you have Bless.
Leopold Magnus 02:05:22 Ah, I see, okay. Come on, how do I get? Oh, apparently you can roll negative D4s. What the, God damn it. Let me, here, ignore that. Okay, so eight. Yeah. And then that's my turn.
Dungeon Master 02:05:34 Differ Bain. Eight misses. Up next after you is gonna be...
Kaladin Shash 02:05:43 No, that hurts.
Zariel Torgan 02:05:45 Ouch.
Dungeon Master 02:05:58 This one right here. He will move out of this to avoid taking fire. He just sort of shovels over to get advantage on you, Leo. You see this like skeleton, sort of like undead creature that had been disguised before, sort of just like as it runs up to you, it'll take its three attacks.
Leopold Magnus 02:06:24 Wait, before we get too far, if he took advantage, what if I had advantage on this guy when I did my stone? Okay, so it has to be a melee to have it. Okay, got it. Right, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:06:32 He gave you, I thought he was giving you a flat. No, because that wasn't a melee.
Dungeon Master 02:06:38 yeah yeah you weren't he he just got flanking with his buddy uh and then he will take his three attacks i think the highest of that one was 14 so 19 to hit what i think still misses
Leopold Magnus 02:07:11 Yeah. That does it. Got it.
Dungeon Master 02:07:11 Uh, 30-20, still misses. Uh, 24 to hit. Okay, we did some damage. Uh, five points of damage. You feeling the wrath yet?
Zariel Torgan 02:07:36 Heh heh heh
Leopold Magnus 02:07:42 I'm so angry.
Dungeon Master 02:07:47 Uh, lair action 15, a couple things going to happen. Uh, nobody, no soldiers have died yet. So nothing comes back. Um, but as a legendary action, he is the Reverend is going to, uh, spend two legendary actions to cast guiding bolt. Uh,
Dungeon Master 02:08:16 It just makes sense to do Zaro because he's right there. Go ahead and give me a ranged spell attack. He's within five feet though, so it'll have disadvantage. But I can't do that because I don't... I didn't actually give it to him. I just made it a legendary action.
Dungeon Master 02:08:48 First one is 17. Second one is 19. Does 19 hit? OK. So you take that. I believe it's 46. Yep.
Zariel Torgan 02:09:02 19 does hit. Oof.
Dungeon Master 02:09:20 You take 16 points of radiant damage. And then it is your turn.
Zariel Torgan 02:09:33 Let's see. I know we're just getting in the middle of this. Trying to think here. I gotta start getting ready to set up for the employee dinner meeting. Is there a stopping point? I mean, I guess, I don't know. I don't know, just trying to think.
Dungeon Master 02:09:59 How much yeah, like how much time do we have left? Mhm. Could you 545? No, and there was some other stuff to introduce, so long as we get to the other part to set up for next time, that'd be fine.
Zariel Torgan 02:10:03 Um, I was wanting to go get started on it at like 530, but that's, that's like really close. And so, I don't know, what do you think? Like, like 545 or something? Or I don't think we're going to finish this fight is my concern. 545?
Zariel Torgan 02:10:28 Okay, all right, well then, yeah, sorry about that, guys. It's just a lot of stuff all happening at once, end of the month and everything. Let's see. Okay. And then we're playing this Wednesday, right? Okay. Okay, okay. I would like to back into my bear form, because I have two of those.
Dungeon Master 02:10:42 Mm-hmm. That's my plan.
Leopold Magnus 02:10:43 Yeah, I think that was fine. Let's see. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:10:44 Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:10:58 and just get back up to some health there. And then, let's move that out of the way. And then, make my attacks on him in bear form. That's all I can do. So that's gonna be a natural one. And,
Kaladin Shash 02:11:20 The numbers could be different. You could still be favored.
Dungeon Master 02:11:27 I miss those. I kind of like it both rolling. You hit with a 19, but if he takes a lot off it, he can, I think, take you down because you're currently at 21.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:31 A 19, now he's got Bane on me, and I've got Bless, so should we both roll, or should it just cancel? Okay. Okay. So that's a two. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:11:58 He takes it back down to 19, you still hit. Nice. Okay, he will use another legendary action.
Kaladin Shash 02:11:59 New. Neutral.
Zariel Torgan 02:12:01 Nice. Nice. Okay, so that's gonna be... 8 slashing damage. And then that's the end of my turn. I used my bonus already, so I'll just stay here, and I'm good.
Dungeon Master 02:12:31 can either move or he can hit you. I think he's going to hit you. He does have advantage because he hits you with the guiding bolt. 19 to hit. Some of you take that plus
Zariel Torgan 02:12:38 Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:13:05 You take 30 points of damage in total. Nice. Okay. That was his lair actions for the round gone. It is now these other undead soldier, the one who's sort of sandwiched.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:14 Still a bear.
Dungeon Master 02:13:36 They're going to try to use their pack tactics to be a little more beneficial to them. So he will just take attacks on Leo because it's a little more convenient to get advantage. And he'll do this two-handed. First one misses.
Dungeon Master 02:14:05 Your AC is so fucking high. Misses. No. I don't think so. And that's 20. Yeah, I didn't roll a 16. I don't know where that came from. They were all pretty low. Misses all three attacks.
Zariel Torgan 02:14:07 Heh heh heh.
Leopold Magnus 02:14:07 It's pretty crazy. But did he roll at 21, though? OK. 20 misses. Got it.
Dungeon Master 02:14:32 Kaladin, because you rolled that d4, your turn, you get a message directly to you from the core. It's really frantic, but you hear this voice hushed, but really anxious and goes, sorry, this is Beatrice. I work in the med bay. Sorry, you're here more often than the others.
Dungeon Master 02:15:01 There's people trying to get in the door. I don't know how they got in, but there's people here. And then it's your turn. Like, it was just to him.
Kaladin Shash 02:15:06 All right. We need to. I think I would communicate.
Leopold Magnus 02:15:19 Was it pretty quiet or what have I heard then too? Got it.
Kaladin Shash 02:15:40 The court is under siege. And the girl we saved might be... They might be coming for her. As my dream said. We need to make quick work of this. I'm going to cast Thunderwave at first level. And I'll sculpt it so that Leopold's doesn't take any effect. This will be a con save.
Dungeon Master 02:16:07 Mm-hmm. Can't save out of both of these guys. They don't have any resistance saves. 11 on the first one. And 12 on the second one.
Kaladin Shash 02:16:34 OK, yeah, the damage wasn't spectacular, but they both fail, so they'll also both be pushed. 10 feet. No force movement doesn't.
Leopold Magnus 02:16:45 So do we all get a tag of opportunity then? Got it. I didn't see your ping, sorry. Is it the one closer to me? Okay, yeah, I see it.
Dungeon Master 02:16:50 No, force movement does not. They both take six. Which one is he? This one right here is looking a little more hurt than the other one. This one right here, yeah. It is Donnie's turn. Unless you've got more.
Kaladin Shash 02:17:11 Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No, I don't think I would. I think I'd move on my turn yet, yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:17:31 He'll... He still has Bless Up. He doesn't want to drop that. A lot of this stuff is concentration. He'll do Toll the Dead at the one who's taken the most damage. So this one right here. And it'll need to be a Wisdom save of 15.
Dungeon Master 02:18:00 Natural 19. He saves. Is it half damage? No. It's all or nothing. Okay. At the end of the turn, it'll be the Reverend. He will...
Kaladin Shash 02:18:03 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:18:32 He'll take an attack at the bear, I guess. But no advantage because he used that. Have you? Perfect, okay. First one was a natural one, which he misses. Does 15 hit?
Zariel Torgan 02:18:39 So OK. And I don't know if you saw these rolls. I was just rolling to see if I maintained concentration on the flaming sphere. Yeah. I did it last time. OK. Yes.
Kaladin Shash 02:18:52 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:19:02 OK. And you take 26 points of damage.
Zariel Torgan 02:19:20 Oof. Ooh, that might be... Okay, so 26, that's 14. I am down. Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:19:35 Zariel is down as well. Oh no. Yeah, his sword is nasty. And then he has a flying speed, so he will maintain his height. So he's about 30 feet off the ground, but he will move forward to the center of the room.
Kaladin Shash 02:19:42 And this guy's banging out radiant damage.
Leopold Magnus 02:19:49 Um. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:20:05 And that'll be the end of his turn at the start of the round. We'll hit the top. Go ahead and somebody roll me a d4 for the lair action. Three, okay, three. Divine Reinforcement. It heals the Reverend and two of his allies for 2d8 hit points.
Zariel Torgan 02:20:17 You want it rexed or you want me to do it? Okay. Ouch.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:23 Three.
Dungeon Master 02:20:41 You see that the stained glass sort of thrums and radiates healing energy. And he and his allies gain five each. But then after that, Leopold, it is your turn. I think he said that out loud.
Leopold Magnus 02:21:02 Yeah, so did Kaladin pass on the information that he got? Okay. I'll say, Kaladin, I think we'd best be going. We need to figure out how to get Zariel. He's taking a little bit of a dirt nap over there.
Kaladin Shash 02:21:08 Yeah. Red Sheet, tell Red Sheet to do it.
Zariel Torgan 02:21:22 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:21:38 Yeah, red shit. Aren't you like, you know, the medicine man type of dude? What, what, what have you been doing? Get in there. What do you mean a bear? That was just Zariel. It's like a thing he does, you know, he turns into animals, but it's still him on the inside.
Dungeon Master 02:21:43 Well, fuck, he was a bear beforehand and then he died just now. I haven't had a chance. I can't heal the bear if it's not Zariel. It's like I fucking thought about it. I just didn't have a chance. Right, but I guess the metaphysical question is if I healed the bear, would it have healed Zariel or just the bear?
Kaladin Shash 02:21:48 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 02:21:52 Okay, Keywords.
Leopold Magnus 02:22:08 Oh, God. All right. I'm done. I'm done arguing. We've got a battle to fight. Let's go. And I'll just run. Kind of take maybe some partial cover behind this. Is this a solid sphere or is this burnt? This is a burning area on the floor. Oh, yeah. OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's see. How far is this?
Dungeon Master 02:22:24 It's gone now because it's already looked down. Yeah, so if you're completely behind it, you can get half cover, which is plus two to your AC.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:25 It's just a ball. Oh yeah, yeah, it's down.
Leopold Magnus 02:22:37 Okay, so I guess I'm going to dash is my bonus action. And is this something to hide behind? Excellent. I'm going to hide behind that. And then for my bonus action, I'm going to go ahead and cast Magic Stone. So pull up three more.
Leopold Magnus 02:23:07 So that's my action that I dashed. Yep, that's my turn.
Dungeon Master 02:23:13 I think that's everything. Okay. It is this guy's turn. He will converge to Donnie and take his three attacks. 13 misses. 19 hits.
Dungeon Master 02:23:44 And that is 23 three hits. So that'll be. I it was only one hit, right? That's what I said. Had to go to a different screen. I think the first one missed for sure, but then it's two hits, so it's 2D8 plus 6 instead.
Leopold Magnus 02:24:04 I know you said three hits, but. Jesus Christ. That should get it together over there.
Dungeon Master 02:24:16 Ratchet takes 20 points of damage. Heavy hit on him. Layer action 15 is when the comms go off. You hear...
Dungeon Master 02:24:46 Captain Levi goes, fuck, fuck, fuck, okay, uh, I've dispatched a few soldiers, uh, I had my mage abandon that fucking chapel, it's, there's no use, I'm gonna head back to the Corps. Uh, do you guys need help? Hello? Okay, uh,
Kaladin Shash 02:24:56 We're going to need something.
Leopold Magnus 02:25:14 Oh no, no!
Dungeon Master 02:25:14 Let me try to get back in contact with Sylvarius. I doubt he's fully dead. Okay, I'll get working on something. And then at the top of the round, Zarya will go ahead and give me, well at the end of the round, give me a death saving throw. One fail.
Zariel Torgan 02:25:33 All right. Fail. I like that it reminded. That's a real snitch thing to do.
Kaladin Shash 02:25:43 Silence.
Dungeon Master 02:25:45 Ratchet has to make a concentration check. I put the concentration adjustment on the token, and then it did that for me. Which is pretty cool. Oh, you called it a snitch thing, though? Con save. Oh, he has War Caster.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:03 It is. Yeah, it is cool. It's just like it's real. It's really. It's really calling you out.
Leopold Magnus 02:26:15 That would get you.
Dungeon Master 02:26:15 He makes it. So you have one fail. OK, we're almost right at 45. Do we want to stop it with that fail? OK.
Kaladin Shash 02:26:19 Saves for sure. That's OK. OK.
Zariel Torgan 02:26:38 Yeah, I'm cool with that. I mean, it leaves it as a suspenseful spot. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:26:43 Zarial, we'll transition for a second to give you something to hang on to. If you'll let me. Let me move it to something else. Do this one.
Dungeon Master 02:27:10 Yeah. Unconscious, you lay in your memory. It's that same one that plays over and over again, where you're in that white, sterile room, and there's the people working on you, except you hear tightening and ratcheting, like a shh, shh, shh, as the ratchet goes back and forth, a memory that you've never seen before. You catch yourself raising your hand, and you look down.
Dungeon Master 02:27:38 You see a metallic hand from your point of view. The hand clenches, all the little gears whir and whiz as the musculature of metal sort of forms and expands. And then you hear the guy go, this one's awake, put him out. And the memory fades. Everybody on the battlefield, give me a second check.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:00 Bye.
Leopold Magnus 02:28:10 Okay, not bad.
Dungeon Master 02:28:12 30, 20 is enough. Uh, in this moment, as you're in this moment, you're probably looking at the river as it's approaching you. You look past it and you see the shoulder wound of where the sword comes through the bear's form, dispelling it and then embedding into
Dungeon Master 02:28:30 Zarya's shoulder before knocking him unconscious, instead of seeing meat and sinew in blood, you see a glint, a shine, something metallic beneath the coating of the skin. And we'll stop it there.
Leopold Magnus 02:28:48 Yeah. Well, that's, that's some pretty good stuff.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:53 Interesting. All right. I really like how you set up this encounter. Yeah. Having all the stuff happen outside and having them die quickly, it was just enough to raise up the little hairs and be like, something else is happening. Something else is going to happen. So very good.
Kaladin Shash 02:28:53 OK. All right, cool.
Dungeon Master 02:29:03 Oh, thanks.

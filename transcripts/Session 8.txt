Kaladin Shash 00:00:00 Welcome Craig. Uh. The only thing I wanted to do before we try to continue on is own his aimhawk.
Dungeon Master 00:00:00 This guy fucks.
Leopold Magnus 00:00:02 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 00:00:07 I have a... Yeah, I think that's good. I would agree. I was gonna say something silly and make a joke, but now I feel like the moment... I'll just say it anyway. Can we get Craig to say specific phrases?
Leopold Magnus 00:00:37 Oh, like a soundboard? Yeah, I don't think so, but that would be funny. I'll play around with that. Maybe I can get a soundboard in here just for fun. What do you want it to say for future reference? Oh, yeah. I have one here.
Dungeon Master 00:00:38 I don't believe so. I think I have downboard. I don't know where I got that from.
Zariel Torgan 00:00:42 Okay. Alright. Alright. I was just- I mean, I don't know. You know, like, uh, if you- I was just thinking of it, you know, like, uh, if you don't chew Big Red, then fuck you, or something like that, you know, just- just some- some fun,
Kaladin Shash 00:00:42 Critical! Critical Role!
Dungeon Master 00:01:11 Oh, I have them, but they're for a different chat, so I can't use them. I just have the basic ones. Imagine using that at the end of somebody's speech.
Zariel Torgan 00:01:15 I heard a duck. Nice.
Leopold Magnus 00:01:22 Yeah, that's the extent of my soundboard. Anyways. Yeah. All right, so Kaladin, you wanted to go see Hamhawk. I think that would be good for me, too. I haven't seen her in a while. I think it would be helpful to see if she needs any help, considering I'm her apprentice.
Kaladin Shash 00:01:26 Thanks. Thanks.
Zariel Torgan 00:01:49 I think, um, before, before we leave the compound, did we come to a consensus on whether or not we wanted to touch base, let them know like, Hey, we're going to be in this area just in case we never come back. Okay. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:01:54 Well, okay.
Kaladin Shash 00:02:06 Yeah. I thought we talked about letting him know what we already know. Rick Ratchett is that we're talking about. Yeah, we can touch base with him. We could do that now before we set up for him. Rocks this mid morning. Uhm? Right?
Zariel Torgan 00:02:20 Yeah, because I was thinking, shit, we just go talk to Hammock and then head straight over. But I mean, we can do other stuff too. Yeah, some civilian clothes, because I have my engineer's clothes and this.
Kaladin Shash 00:02:26 Well, I mean, we could talk to him, see if they can give us any other advice on how we how we could infiltrate or sneak in. Right. Like as far as like some disguised clothes rather than our uniforms or whatever. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, we've got the the amulet or whatever the thing is that helps us get in. That we would normally show where the talent.
Zariel Torgan 00:02:53 Yeah, we probably don't need anything too crazy.
Kaladin Shash 00:02:58 And all we know we just we we was it did all we know was it was an old chapel. Is that what it was, Tom? I was underground, so do I. Basement. OK, based on some chapels.
Dungeon Master 00:03:07 You were told that it wasn't necessarily an old chapel, but that the cult is operating out of the basement of some chapel.
Leopold Magnus 00:03:22 Yeah, I think it might be best to see Hamhawk to see if I can get a disguise, because I think that might be a little bit more difficult than you guys.
Kaladin Shash 00:03:31 Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:03:36 Yeah, I do like the idea that there's a robocop wearing a cop uniform and you're like, uh, hello fellow students. Like you're not like the only robot cop, like in the entire world.
Leopold Magnus 00:03:51 That would be funny. I think canonically speaking, Leopold is very unusual. Is that correct? Yeah. Yes, exactly. Yeah. And then you said there wasn't very many automatons. Right. Got it.
Dungeon Master 00:03:52 I think you described him as being like very tall, enormously heavy and clumsy. All about flavoring because you're still a preacher, mind you, mechanically. And yeah, there's just not a ton, not openly and not anything like as advanced.
Kaladin Shash 00:04:03 Like almost 8 feet tall, like 7'10 or something. What do we want to tell Ratchet just that we got information out of? Not Ollie, what was that one? Cedric.
Zariel Torgan 00:04:34 Yeah, I figure we just kind of let him know what we've heard, maybe just as a bit of a soundboard to see what he might think. And then just say, hey, we're headed this way. If you have any ideas, just keeping you apprised. That was kind of my hope, but I'm a greedy bastard, so.
Kaladin Shash 00:04:52 Yeah, maybe we can get a token for our effort. Yeah. Yeah, that's all right. Celebrate that.
Dungeon Master 00:05:07 All right, you guys, yeah, you make your way down the hall of the sort of corridors of the core towards one of the meeting rooms until you see through like a thin window, not actually reflected on this map, again, just a general map, like just into like an office and you see Ratchet is at the corner just looking over some paperwork, typing some stuff in, seems to just be doing some like general
Zariel Torgan 00:05:07 But I'll follow you over there.
Dungeon Master 00:05:37 uh commanding officer task that he does every morning probably he's got like some arcane rune that reflect on his like wrist guard and he seems to be inputting some stuff you don't know what it could be it could be in essence like
Zariel Torgan 00:05:42 When you say typing stuff in, is he using a... What's he using?
Kaladin Shash 00:05:50 Are you ready?
Dungeon Master 00:06:02 the equivalent of a calculator it could be he's casting magic you don't know but there's definitely like a pad similar to what you've seen with Kaladin I don't know if it's been really discussed too much but his spells come from essentially what is his tome which is like his wrist guard which pops up the rooms he needs going to cast stuff
Zariel Torgan 00:06:23 Interesting. Very cool. All right. Sorry, go ahead.
Leopold Magnus 00:06:29 What is the, is the room decorated with anything?
Dungeon Master 00:06:33 It's more basic than this, but there are just like some random paintings on the wall, some like graphs stapled into like the wall that have just like, you know, employment rates and employees versus cost versus this. And there's like on a different wall, very similar to like the main meeting room, you have like open job assignments that have yet to be filled, things like that, just like general things you would find in what you expect to be like a military office, just like reports, graphs,
Dungeon Master 00:07:04 a painting here and there, some books that are just vague in general and don't seem entirely interesting kind of deal, just like random shit. Yeah, go ahead and give me, are you just gonna go right up to it?
Leopold Magnus 00:07:15 Cool. Can I make a little investigation check into the open jobs just to kind of file them away for later? Yeah, I'm just going to walk in and kind of scan those posted papers.
Dungeon Master 00:07:32 Yeah, you see like one of them says open assignment challenge low and then like below that just a little quip with like a little hash mark that just says good job for new recruits assigned to next batch question mark. Another one says missing persons report location storm district and like a sticky note put over it says
Dungeon Master 00:08:01 tied to other case close. And then one that you had already seen, but now has sort of been opened up, they have a big open report that says, assignment, dome exploration. And then it had like a little quip about the festival and the attack and the loss of the sort of omen nights as they have not been recovered.
Dungeon Master 00:08:25 And that one says just like searching for candidates is like the only other thing written on it. And those are like the three open ones. He just looks up at the weird pause as three people enter the room and one of them is standing at the wall looking at the assignments.
Leopold Magnus 00:08:35 Cool, awesome.
Dungeon Master 00:08:54 And he just, he looks at you and he goes, Lorna, could I help you? Well rested in you. Right. Please sit. Let's hear what you got.
Kaladin Shash 00:08:57 Hello, Rachid. Yes, Rachid, how are you doing today? Very good. We've got some more information about the investigation you asked us to do about the cultists. We spoke with an informant.
Zariel Torgan 00:09:18 Thank you.
Kaladin Shash 00:09:25 Informant was a man named Cedric at the spit and swallow. Yeah. Yes, there are some. Basic negotiations, if you will.
Dungeon Master 00:09:29 You see he starts typing in arcane runes that you see very quickly or shorthand. They each mean syllables of a sentence, as you can tell he uses this to scribe down active thoughts, or in this case a report, as he's just matching basically what you say.
Kaladin Shash 00:09:55 He answered some of our questions. And we've got a lead. In what is the Dom district. We found out they are operating out of a basement and a chapel. Do we know of any other information in the area?
Dungeon Master 00:10:16 Well, uh, not, not necessarily. It's fairly vague. I appreciate your voice is enthusiasm, but I would say this is far from done, right? Um, Dawn district is a good start. We can put a little heavier rotation of some soldiers out there. Um, any idea on where or just Dawn district?
Kaladin Shash 00:10:44 That's all we have for now. Oh man, I'm way off on the accent there. Yeah, very good. Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:10:49 I'm bringing... I'm bringing... Daphredonia. Uh... Yes.
Zariel Torgan 00:10:49 It's all right.
Leopold Magnus 00:11:00 I think Leopold kind of steps backwards from the wall. His head spins 360 degrees to look towards Ratchet. And he goes, Sir Ratchet, I have one question for you. Has there been any known disturbances in the district? You know, anything maybe we should be aware of that's been coming through the grapevine?
Kaladin Shash 00:11:25 Good.
Dungeon Master 00:11:25 And he looks down, types some things in, he pulls up an arcane screen powered, you can see, from the table where a base set of runes project information. And he goes, well, it's not really my district. I could do some more research if you'd like, but this is all fairly new, if you guys, if you boys remember, this is... Days have only passed. This is... You are the assigning team. This is...
Dungeon Master 00:11:53 You would be the folks to tell us any new information. What do you mean a voucher? Uniform update. First you have to see HR.
Leopold Magnus 00:11:57 Yeah. Let's.
Kaladin Shash 00:11:57 Very well, very well. My other question, can I have a voucher to go visit Hermark? I need a uniform update.
Dungeon Master 00:12:20 and they'll get you a form for job transition title. Are you, uh, sorry to pry if it's private. I understand if it's like a medical thing, but which are you changing things? Are you, what's sort of the uniform chain, right? Uh,
Kaladin Shash 00:12:37 No, no. I have new skills. I have a need for better armor.
Dungeon Master 00:12:47 Well, I'm going to be honest, I could, but I don't think I'm technically allowed to. You get like one voucher. It's sort of the whole thing. It's self-mending. It's a big deal. But from what I understand, you're pretty close with Ham Hock. I figure they might do it for you on the house, so to speak. He sort of looks a little interested.
Kaladin Shash 00:13:07 Very well, very well. Yeah, I would, as my spear is dexterity-based, I would just simply, because we're seated, I would just stand up.
Leopold Magnus 00:13:12 All right.
Dungeon Master 00:13:17 what you've been working on then. I've seen you demonstrate some pretty strong magic before.
Kaladin Shash 00:13:36 and the quarterstaff would extend to its full length and I would just sort of do a quick like set of steps and poses and whatever, some twirls. This is what I can do. Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:13:52 I like it. He's just fucking doing some Bruce Lee type moves with just like a spear. Fucking fantastic. I'm more of a support soldier myself. I was never one to get my hands dirty, but I've always had an envy of those who could fight. You guys are a pretty interesting trio, I will say.
Leopold Magnus 00:13:56 It's playing in the ground.
Dungeon Master 00:14:18 Unless there's something else, I'm expected for a meeting in here shortly. It'll be weird if you guys are seen just sort of dilly-dallying. But not you will be aware. It's a new as far as anybody is concerned.
Leopold Magnus 00:14:28 Yeah, I was going to say so he was going to look through that that data. I guess what I'm looking for is maybe going back more than a couple of days because like this cultist group has been operating for for a while. Right. So I was maybe going to try to. Right. Yeah, exactly. So some evidence of weird stuff ongoing that maybe could tip us off to the cultists, that's why I was going to look through the records.
Kaladin Shash 00:14:28 Yes, very well. Right, but are there regular reports of crime or missing things or whatever?
Dungeon Master 00:14:51 Yeah, and he'll go, right, I'll look into it. Like I said, this is, I primarily am responsible in operating the storm district. I'd have to reach out to a colleague. It'll take a little bit, but I'll look into it if you'd like.
Kaladin Shash 00:15:02 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:15:15 Well, yes, of course, that would be excellent. I would even be happy to assist you. I am quite a wizard when it comes to paperwork. Well, to be honest, sir, no, actually. Yes, yes, okay.
Dungeon Master 00:15:22 Oh, that's fine. I'm sure you have important things to do. No, no, really, I insist. I implore you to please go do your job. No. You forget that we're all sort of friends in the higher ups. I've heard about your little expedition and the fucking
Zariel Torgan 00:15:23 He doesn't he does make a really good apprentice.
Kaladin Shash 00:15:38 You.
Dungeon Master 00:15:52 The lab there. Apprentice, may I ask? You are my fucking subordinate. Get the fuck out of here. I'll get back to you. I'm sure they don't want to. Please.
Zariel Torgan 00:15:58 Uh...
Leopold Magnus 00:15:58 Oh, excuse me? How dare you talk to Hamhawk's apprentice in such a way? Well, of course, but you know Hamhawk will be hearing about this. And I'll walk forwards, but I'll still have my head on backwards, looking at them kind of walk into the wall, stumble backwards.
Dungeon Master 00:16:24 He's just staring. He just looks anxious. He just doesn't understand. Go ahead and give me a perception check as you walk away, because you were the closest to him. 11. Yeah, nothing special.
Leopold Magnus 00:16:31 As I stumble backwards, my head flips forward and I walk on out. 11. Got it.
Zariel Torgan 00:16:36 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:16:57 Just some fun stuff you missed. OK. What's your guys' next opposite to ham hocks?
Kaladin Shash 00:17:03 Off to him, Mark, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:17:07 You guys are moving around a lot. Again, this is a pretty big city, so like an hour or so later, hitting about noon, you guys finally managed to make it to Hamhawk's sort of forge lab that's situated at sort of the beginning, sort of the entrance area of the Storm District. As you guys make your way in, get your little tokens on here.
Dungeon Master 00:17:33 If you guys are at the entrance as always, not where it puts you. You guys are over here. Do anything special or just right to business?
Zariel Torgan 00:17:43 Hmm. Insight check. Is it OK if I roll an insight check on that?
Leopold Magnus 00:17:47 Yeah, as we're walking over to the shop, I'll explain to the group about my workshop, talking about how, you know, it's not really Hamhawk who's in charge, kind of bragging a little bit. Yeah, absolutely. Let's see.
Kaladin Shash 00:18:02 I love that. Yes, she's gonna win. She's gonna win. He's like, he's like, wow, right? Yeah, boy. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:18:08 Yeah. Give me deception or persuasion, depending on if you believe yourself. Oh!
Zariel Torgan 00:18:12 Oh, so bad. So bad. So you're saying that I reach out and I grab your shoulder? I'm like, really?
Leopold Magnus 00:18:17 I'm going to do I'm going to do a persuasion because I. I believe it. Well, yeah, I guess maybe it would be a deception. Leopold kind of. Oh, he wins. OK, so, yeah, you just you just think it's a. Yeah, that's funny.
Zariel Torgan 00:18:40 You're saying that you're really the one running things around here? You can see Zariel has a gleam in his eye. He's very impressed.
Leopold Magnus 00:18:43 Well, you know, I kind of am, to be honest with you, but maybe not running the whole show. But to be honest, I'm in charge. And then I kind of bump into a table and some flasks or whatever was sitting on it falls off.
Kaladin Shash 00:18:58 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 00:19:04 and what the
Zariel Torgan 00:19:10 I had no idea.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:23 Oh, uh, yes. Uh, uh, sir. Uh, ham hock master. Yes. Uh, Leopold Magnus, your utmost, uh, fervent assistant at your service. And I kind of back away from the table and kind of bobble head up. Right.
Dungeon Master 00:19:41 Oh. Again, I'm... No, uh, it's... Huh. Light hand or heavy hand? You are not... my apprentice. Let's get that clear. What? What do you mean about that? Anyway, well...
Zariel Torgan 00:19:53 You can say that again. Yeah. Yeah. No, you're right. You're no apprentice. You're no assistant. That's ridiculous, an insinuation. You're a good man.
Leopold Magnus 00:19:56 Well, you tell him, Zariel. I did tell you the truth. And then I kind of underhand try to cuff my breath. Tell Zariel, I just let him do it so it makes him feel better.
Dungeon Master 00:20:10 What the fuck can I do for you guys? Good to see you, but Jesus.
Zariel Torgan 00:20:22 Very generous. And I'll just kind of slowly make my eye contact back over to Hamhawk. You're doing good work here. Good work, Hamhawk.
Kaladin Shash 00:20:40 Okay, enough, enough of that, both of you, stop. Hamak, I have a special request.
Dungeon Master 00:20:56 on a 16 Hamhawk looks at you and narrows their eyes. Hmm. Yeah, what can I do for you at Caledon? OK, I can.
Kaladin Shash 00:21:08 I've expanded my own skill sets. I need an automer. I need a medium automer that can protect me a little bit. If he alters the current stuff,
Dungeon Master 00:21:24 I can alter your current and stuff, or we can start from scratch, I suppose. I'll just charge your cost of materials, because that's all, it'll be pretty easy otherwise.
Kaladin Shash 00:21:39 Yeah, if they do the current suit, does that mean I still get the healing? Or if he totally does something and we come back, does that mean it doesn't do healing or regenerate or whatever?
Dungeon Master 00:21:50 It would all have the same stuff in the end anyway. It's just whether or not you want to keep like the same flavor of your outfit that you had designed up for yourself. Or do you want to just be like new armor, new look.
Kaladin Shash 00:22:06 No, I think it would be a progression of what it already looks like. I think my armor was described as like. Like blue and something else. What did I say? Yeah, like silver platinum, kind of like my hair.
Dungeon Master 00:22:19 I've got it written somewhere, honestly. Nice. Yeah, so you are welcome to do that. She takes down sort of the description, writes in like bullet point details, and then look at the mage hand, sends it over to a desk, and she goes, oh, I'll get on the,
Zariel Torgan 00:22:21 Yeah, I thought it was like blue and platinum and like, like, yeah, yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:22:49 Pretty quickly, if you'd like, actually. Come back in a half hour or so. I could use some base plates that I've got on some pending orders. I'm sure they're not going to love their stuff being late, but what can you do about it? Anything else I could do for you? Well, I'll just look up what the price of, like, are you looking for medium or heavy?
Kaladin Shash 00:23:02 And then, Jonathan, would I understand what cost of materials would be? Medium. I don't want to have a stealth disadvantage. And as I'm a dexterity-based fighter, I think medium just plays a little better into it. It still has some magic. Like we said, for flavor, I could still have a breastplate and one shoulder guard or something.
Dungeon Master 00:23:30 Mm-hmm. Yeah, studded leather is classically 45. We'll just say cost of materials would be 20. There's just the upsides of it. I don't know. I'll get you the change on whatever the materials is. And you see, same thing, mage hand over to the corner, just like next to the parchment and the tip, just planted there, just as like a reminder. She goes, ah.
Kaladin Shash 00:23:38 Okay, I still throw 40 gold on the counter.
Dungeon Master 00:24:00 Like I said, yeah, they'll take a pretty short time, just cost of enchanting and cost of time of enchanting, pardon, don't want to get misinformation these days. Anything else I can do for you? Love it. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 00:24:12 That's going to be it.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:14 Well, do you think that I might be able to get some, maybe some medium armor as well? I've noticed I'm real easy to hit, so that kind of sucks for me. Well,
Dungeon Master 00:24:37 What's, if so, your armor class these days? Oh, you just have light armor. Are you proficient? Oh, you are a proficient median. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:24:44 As of right now, without a shield, we're looking at about 13.
Dungeon Master 00:25:05 She goes, oh, yeah, same thing. I can get you some heavier shit. Sorry, I guess I just, when I first saw you, you kind of looked like a pussy is all I'm saying. I didn't think you could handle it. She's smart, like a big, big sort of ogre grin, just kind of fucking with you. Same thing, just, yeah, custom materials, give me some bold appointed list of what you want and give me,
Kaladin Shash 00:25:15 Bye.
Zariel Torgan 00:25:17 Well, that does hurt my feelings.
Dungeon Master 00:25:32 15 more minutes I can sort of double-task a lot of the things similar enchantments I can do at the same time As long as I can focus after this so we'll say Caledon back in an hour. Are you back in an hour 15 deal? Love it lovely any hesitant to fucking ask nah, uh, I
Zariel Torgan 00:25:47 Sounds fantastic.
Kaladin Shash 00:25:48 Excellent.
Dungeon Master 00:25:57 I got nothing for you right now, Leopold, my dear. You're not my apprentice. I don't need your help with any projects. I promise I'll let you know through your COs if I need your help. But for now, I'm going to require some privacy.
Leopold Magnus 00:26:11 Well, okay, if that's what you insist. Then I lean back to the rest of the guys and say, I let him do that because it makes him feel better.
Zariel Torgan 00:26:24 You truly are a good person. You gotta just let people have their run of things sometimes. It builds character. I was gonna ask earlier if I could just cursory glance at anything that just looks sweet. Could I also take a peek?
Leopold Magnus 00:26:35 And then can I kind of peek just in the workshop a little bit, see if I get a glance, anything interesting that they're building right now?
Dungeon Master 00:26:42 Yeah, give me a perception check. It depends. You are in sort of, we'll say like the foyer, like a lot more forged type things, basic weapons, armors, some enchanting and book stuff. But where Leopold is right now, he's looking into like Hamhawk Slav Official. So he's going to see if there is anything, the cooler stuff, whereas you would see just like
Dungeon Master 00:27:12 Is there other normal cool stuff here, if that's cool, unless you want to walk up and try to look behind them? Yeah, go ahead and give me a percentage check, too. No, you did not.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:20 Yeah, well, while I'm chatting with Leo about, because, you know, Leo told me he's in charge. I'll take a peek over there if I can. Fifteen?
Leopold Magnus 00:27:34 I don't think I've got much.
Dungeon Master 00:27:39 15 you see that the at like their main table just sort of in the back corner of the room. There's like an enchanting circle itch on the table and there seems to be like some sort of pinned blueprint with something they seem to be working on but a 15 is not high enough to sort of get a look at what it is that there is currently a project.
Zariel Torgan 00:27:58 Interesting. Alright, well, I'll leave well enough alone, drop off the same amount of cash that my friend Kaladin did, and make my way out.
Kaladin Shash 00:28:18 Ham Hock. Ham Hock. Last question. Is there a place that we could perhaps get potions or perhaps some sort of a ring of protection?
Leopold Magnus 00:28:18 Um, oh, good.
Dungeon Master 00:28:19 Yeah. That's more of a, I guess, like a market district kind of find. If you've got the cash to pay street rates, go for it.
Zariel Torgan 00:28:34 That'd be sweet.
Dungeon Master 00:28:48 You guys are just sort of new yet. The Corps has access to capabilities like that. It's just sort of a prove your worth, get your bonus kind of deal. So, you know, the streets work a little bit harder. I may go on a regular basis. I just can't get you in right now.
Kaladin Shash 00:28:59 Yes. Okay. Okay, good to know. Thank you.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:02 We are impatient by nature. Yes. Thank you. Guidance. Guidance.
Leopold Magnus 00:29:19 And I guess as I exit, I will try to persuade Hamhawk to contact me if they have a job. Because I don't think they will. Ah, 13. All right. Ah, 15.
Dungeon Master 00:29:20 Absolutely. Give me a general persuasion check. I'll put D4.
Kaladin Shash 00:29:28 Thanks, thanks.
Zariel Torgan 00:29:41 I have a D4.
Dungeon Master 00:29:49 It was a DC 15. I'll call that good. Then you just, you, you, it's less of them saying something that reaffirms it. I think you mentioned something on your way out that they don't really respond to, but after saying it, you're like, they'll probably recruit me. Like I, I do have value in the field. Like at least like some self-talk as you're like walking away, like you did a pretty good job of the last thing you did. It's not like they're not going to contact you.
Leopold Magnus 00:30:19 Got it.
Dungeon Master 00:30:25 Where to now? It's sort of more advanced as New New Arbor is compared to
Kaladin Shash 00:30:29 Would we have any idea of how much street value would be on items like that, like a potion or ring of protection, something simple?
Dungeon Master 00:30:51 classic D&D type stuff, it is still very like barter and trade method stuff. So it's, you know, if the person likes you, it might be cheaper. If you make a bad impression, they'll charge you more. They're going to charge you enough to make a profit and then be able to get new stuff as well. So it's a lot more like, I hate to say it with the parties dynamics, but it's a lot more charisma based encounters to get good deals on stuff. There is a general rate price range on reference, but
Kaladin Shash 00:31:16 That's fine. I don't have anything to do for the hour. Do you guys have anything to do or want to do, address?
Dungeon Master 00:31:21 Good check to find something and then good checks to make sure you can afford it.
Zariel Torgan 00:31:36 Um... Nah, I think I'm good.
Leopold Magnus 00:31:43 Yeah, if we're not going to the market, I don't have anything. Not for an hour.
Kaladin Shash 00:31:49 Oh, cool. We just time jump? Or is there something that we should be doing? I think the blue studded, I think the studded armor component would have like a sort of a,
Dungeon Master 00:31:54 Yeah. You guys come back at that same time. You pick up your armors. If you want to describe something new, go for it, of what it looks like. Otherwise, we'll just go into the next thing of whatever you guys want to do after you pick up your armor.
Kaladin Shash 00:32:17 a darker blue sort of brown hue to the leather itself, right? And then I think that the chest plate and the shoulder piece would still be like a kind of like a brushed nickel-esque, still with that blue and sort of silver component. Maybe I don't have
Kaladin Shash 00:32:47 Ants, you know, maybe I still have sort of like a sort of a split robe sort of bottom type thing like leather up top. A little wizard approach going. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:32:59 Nice, nice, nice. Heavier armor top, flowy bottom, color scheme keeping the blue and the sort of cerulean colors. Zorro, what does your new fit look like? Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:14 Um, I assume that going from light to medium is going to be from like leather to studded leather or something. And so I hope that, uh, ham hawk, uh, I just watched escape from the blood keep. So I keep wanting to say ham head. Um, uh, took the flowery design with the vines and the pedals and just add it in like thorns.
Dungeon Master 00:33:32 Mhm. Mhm. Mhm.
Kaladin Shash 00:33:32 To.
Zariel Torgan 00:33:43 two of the studs for the studded leather. And so there's just lots of little pokies and little metal tines and things that are just kind of crafted right into the petals and the stems of the natural design.
Dungeon Master 00:34:01 Alrighty, alrighty. Love it. Yeah, maybe like more of that sort of metal wooden plating, just in different spots for a little more reinforcement protection. So once you guys pick up the stuff, what's what is sort of your direction here?
Zariel Torgan 00:34:13 Mhm. Um.
Kaladin Shash 00:34:20 I guess start heading to the Don district just to see if we can figure out anything.
Leopold Magnus 00:34:26 Jonathan, do we have a map of that district? Like, would that be available to us from the Corps? Okay, and would it describe, like, where churches are and other locations?
Dungeon Master 00:34:33 Yeah, like general city map you can get one focused in on like the Dong district easy enough But it would have Like the whole thing is technically like a religious district. So there are churches gathered everywhere to obscure gods and the prime deities and like
Dungeon Master 00:34:57 multiple chains of the prime deities and like all of that and like there's some housing in between but the the Dondestik is truly for like the devout and faithful and so a map that had just like a list of the chapels would still have like hundreds of locations.
Leopold Magnus 00:35:16 Got it. Is there, I guess, like, if I did a religion check, is there any religions that are maybe known for being more radical than others, like zealots of a specific cause, or, like, just ideologically, like, isolated, you know, maybe not as popular as some of the other religions?
Dungeon Master 00:35:36 Yeah, go for it. Nine, I mean, they're like the deities of old before the age of the heroes where the new gods ascended, where you've got the classic devil who was Asmodeus and you had
Leopold Magnus 00:35:50 Damn, not getting much.
Kaladin Shash 00:35:54 Mm-mm.
Dungeon Master 00:36:06 The Dawnfather Pelor and all of these other things and then when they left the world there was like the uprising and now there's the new pantheon of like Viteo and Ica and fate and you've got Zera and like all of the prime deities that if you wanted to spend time looking into you could. But then like
Dungeon Master 00:36:28 I'll say a nine is low enough that you, again, because you've done this before, so I like planning this. A nine is low enough that you know you're missing something. There's something you can't recall that most people remember when they think about religion. But in this moment, you're like, just drawing a blank. Just cat got your tongue, can't get it out. Yes.
Leopold Magnus 00:36:47 So I would remember that Cedric was a follower of Viteo, though, right? And the knowledge of Viteo, are they kind of like that type? Or I mean, are they just kind of all blend in, the rest of them, like in my mind?
Dungeon Master 00:37:01 um equivalent like true neutral vitae was an adventuring party member of the like the big five the group that ascended in like the most recent age uh and they are like the the deity of justice and wrath so they sort of
Dungeon Master 00:37:23 their balance in the whole divine equation is just making sure there is as much social balance, and that's what the preach is. And when they were on the prime realm in Redivir, their word was law. They dealt out justice in their city. But since they've left, it's, again, just back to the concept of morality, ethics, law, fair, right, and then the counter of that
Dungeon Master 00:37:49 uh just uh the wrath and punishment and you know actions have consequences kind of god so it's it's but it's like a ying and yang in one because and this is common knowledge at the at the time of ascension two gods came together it was va and teo it was justice and wrath but neutral overall
Kaladin Shash 00:38:13 Mm hmm.
Leopold Magnus 00:38:13 Right, yeah, I recall that. Okay, then I will turn to the party and... Hey, boys, do you find it odd that Cedric was a follower of Viteo, and that he pointed us towards a chapel in the Dawn District?
Zariel Torgan 00:38:33 Out of game, we knew that that wasn't necessarily true. We just rolled like dog shit to figure that out, right? That he wasn't really a follower of Viteos, or that there was some weirdness to that. That he was being apprehensive, that we thought that it was maybe something different.
Dungeon Master 00:38:43 Which part? You could tell that something wasn't being talked about, but the symbol he carried is like very obviously a variation that he gave to you of Viteo.
Dungeon Master 00:39:04 Um, and he preached that he was a follower of a tail and. Um. There's not a lot else to get from it. You do guys do remember out of game that you rolled pretty poorly, but in game there you just caught that they didn't trust you. Up to you.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:21 Yeah. Well, that makes sense. Okay.
Kaladin Shash 00:39:23 Jonathan, is there a specific armor kit you want us to load? Just any medium armors? Studded keeps coming up as light. Well, yeah, all the studded I can see keep coming up as light armor.
Dungeon Master 00:39:33 Studded armor is, I think, the most consistent, like, best medium armor. Yeah, then you guys keep talking, doing things, I'll figure it out.
Kaladin Shash 00:39:57 Okay. And I talked about having some half plate anyway. That's one of them. Spiked armor.
Zariel Torgan 00:39:58 We could just do like scale mail. I mean, it's basically the same. I mean, isn't... Aren't all the deities...
Leopold Magnus 00:40:17 Did you guys have any thoughts around that?
Dungeon Master 00:40:18 Okay, you do have play for sure. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 00:40:29 in the Don district, isn't that kind of where they're all relegated to? So it wouldn't be that crazy.
Kaladin Shash 00:40:33 Yeah, I think we could start with the churches that would, I think we could start with the churches of that deity, the goddess of justice, was it Voltara?
Leopold Magnus 00:40:49 Wrath and Justice Mateo. Yeah, I was thinking it's probably our best lead, considering Cedric was a little bit cagey when it came to the questioning about his connection with the cult. So I think it might be a fair bet to say that they were associated.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:09 Yeah, I would think so. So all of these medium armors are giving me a disadvantage on stealth. Is that normal? Alright, well I won't get too worried about it.
Dungeon Master 00:41:13 Alright, so. You might be adding. Yeah. He says he's proficient with medium armor, but. I'm not sure why we could fix it later.
Kaladin Shash 00:41:22 if you're not proficient.
Zariel Torgan 00:41:38 Just wondering. I'll deal with it later. All right, there we go. I got something.
Leopold Magnus 00:42:02 So, how many temples of Viteo are on the map of the Dawn District? Oh, there's that many of Viteo specifically.
Dungeon Master 00:42:10 uh again just like a fuck ton you guys can go to the most popular but like game lore wise i did not write down like 200 names of different temples of pateo but there are very i mean you gotta remember new new arbor is like a mega city and the don district is a sixth of a megacity so there is a lot of large small you know
Zariel Torgan 00:42:15 Mmm.
Kaladin Shash 00:42:31 image.
Dungeon Master 00:42:38 cathedral size, single story house size, like there's the variation of everything, but there's just like a lot of followers of the tale.
Zariel Torgan 00:42:52 Hmm. Yeah, let's do it.
Leopold Magnus 00:42:54 the
Kaladin Shash 00:43:04 Yes, let us seek one out.
Dungeon Master 00:43:12 Nice. We're hitting about two o'clock or so in the afternoon. It's still plenty of sunlight. You're out in your day. You're strolling. You make it into the dawn district and truly like living on the other side of paradise. You guys go from like the dreariness of the storm district and you hit like the dawn district and it's bright and it almost feels golden around you of just light ambient and natural and like lantern and
Dungeon Master 00:43:43 Everybody is talking and chatting and walking with him. Most people you see dress in very modest attire. You know, they give themselves in their piety and they don't have material goods. And then you see some people who are very obviously wealthy and they're just like visiting the Don District for the day for prayer and temple and all that stuff. And just so people going to and from chatting as they make their way and you're walking through.
Dungeon Master 00:44:11 Do you go to a specific location? Do you stop somebody and ask? As you guys sort of will say, enter the district and you're sort of taking everything in. What is your mode of sort of sussing out where to go?
Kaladin Shash 00:44:29 Can I make a an investigation check and see if I notice any sort of. Markings that we saw similar to. The cultists had this. Didn't they carve something into their paint something on themselves? Broad. Yep.
Dungeon Master 00:44:48 Give me a perception check first, because you're taking in a pretty large array of space, and then based off of that, you'll get a perception check out of it too. I mean, sorry, an investigation. It seems good.
Kaladin Shash 00:45:00 OK. OK, yeah, so yeah, I'm guessing right now I'm just looking for symbols over doorways or on a signpost, just something whatever. I'll do the. The first. Glance. Oh, that's not bad. There's almost 2018.
Zariel Torgan 00:45:02 Yeah, can I? Nice.
Dungeon Master 00:45:19 Yeah, give me, as you walk up, give me, you know, I won't even make you do the investigation. You'll find like the best thing in this area that you're looking for. You guys are walking down the street and you see there is a short sort of rotund man balding on top. He's got just like auburn brown hair that's thinning.
Dungeon Master 00:45:45 you see that he's got this little cart and on it are a lot of like talismans and necklaces hanging from like wooden pegs he's got on the backboard the whole part moves so you think that he probably like rolls it in and out and around trying to catch the the most popular times but on it are very obviously very similar frontward facing palms with the fingers spread out the fingers aren't curled forward like the one you have they are
Dungeon Master 00:46:13 almost identical even in the metal otherwise and you see him just sort of like please stop in the name of the lord i've got talismans for all one silver a pop and you'll get closer to god as he's just doing his street performance to sell these stuff in uh that's the closest thing you find
Zariel Torgan 00:46:40 I'm gonna guide Kaladin. No, I assume you're gonna interact with this guy and you're gonna need to make a roll. So just way ahead, I'm just gonna reach out and just give you a little burst of light. You got this.
Kaladin Shash 00:46:47 Like just right now, like roll it again, or you want me like just the next time I'll have guidance. OK. Thank you. No guidance. Oh, I have an approach. I just kind of continue to walk up towards the cart. Do you make these things? Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:47:10 As you get closer and closer, he looks right at you and he goes, I can tell you are in need of faith, my friend. How do you feel about the fair and just goddess Viteo? Interesting answer, but I do see a lack of
Kaladin Shash 00:47:27 She is of great interest to me. Yes. Of course, I have a question. I see all of these with hands stretched out. You have one with hands curled.
Dungeon Master 00:47:37 Iconography, we'll call it, on your person. Do you practice? Are you looking to practice? I don't normally make them like that, no. I guess I could bend them. It's not a very hard metal under heat.
Kaladin Shash 00:48:01 I've just seen other ones like it. What are the most popular spots for you to sell these?
Dungeon Master 00:48:06 I don't do normally custom orders, but uh, why? He sort of drops the theatrics for a second. You know, it's like going to a street person stand and being like, Hey, can you bend this jewelry for me? Well, um, mainly I,
Dungeon Master 00:48:34 I switch up my tech, well, in the name of Pateo, I sell them where I feel I am drawn to. So this is just where I felt inclined today, and it has nothing to do with incoming and outgoing masses of certain followers. Just drops the act. All right, guy, Jesus.
Kaladin Shash 00:48:38 Speak more plainly. Where is your best business at?
Zariel Torgan 00:48:54 We should probably ask him. Oh, go ahead. Sorry. I was just going to say, um, our guys are shady, probably very poor and they're working out of a basement.
Dungeon Master 00:49:04 I sell normally just out of the main chapel.
Kaladin Shash 00:49:12 Do you ever see any? Yeah. Yes, fair enough.
Zariel Torgan 00:49:23 So we should probably ask him where his worst business is. And that's probably where they're going to be.
Kaladin Shash 00:49:35 My colleague would like to know too where perhaps is the worst of your business, perhaps clientele wise, or perhaps a practice in an unusual setting.
Dungeon Master 00:49:50 I mean, obviously, you guys are legionnaire. I'm just saying you guys are weird in the way you come off and these are some odd questions with no context or pretext. Uh well, my my main gig is II attend the court of Mateo, the main chapel sort of on the main strip over there. Uh my big thing is I give a donation of each of the
Dungeon Master 00:50:17 And that way, the High Cleric doesn't forbid me from selling memorabilia, essentially, of the god of Viteo, sort of just like a treaty we have on this. But I would say the worst spot to sell iconography of Viteo would probably be on a few spots that worship, like, the New Age betrayer gods.
Kaladin Shash 00:50:37 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 00:50:46 God, uh, forget all their names, but the primary ones that, you know, most people tend to not worship openly would be, uh, Jathan Renan, the sort of new devils of the world before the war and all that. Uh, obviously everybody knows that. So that's, uh, where I tend to not be most often is outside of those houses. But you looking to get into some dark shit?
Dungeon Master 00:51:16 He's like like fully just like more interested in your story now than anything just like what are you getting up to? That is what I said You've just sort of been talking about it you haven't shown it
Leopold Magnus 00:51:23 Oh, dark shit, I say. I do say, good sir. Have you ever seen anything quite like this? And I hold out the, uh, you know, the finger with the thumbs curled.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:24 Have we shown him the hand? Has he seen the iconography thing that we have, or have we just been roundabout? It's his robot penis.
Leopold Magnus 00:51:55 Well, I'm holding it basically at waist level, so it does kind of look like maybe at first glance it could be.
Dungeon Master 00:51:56 Oh, flashing. So you're suit armor, you don't have a dick. You hold it out and shock hits his face first more than anything, and he goes, well, Viteo, judge me just. That is, in fact, one of mine, but shit, I apologize for my hasty decision. I guess somebody is, in fact, bending the tips of the fingers.
Zariel Torgan 00:51:59 Okay.
Kaladin Shash 00:51:59 Okay.
Dungeon Master 00:52:27 Couldn't tell you why, but I can promise you that's one of mine. Give me an insight check. As truthful as anybody else you've ever talked to. Doesn't seem like he's lying.
Zariel Torgan 00:52:32 Do I believe him? Guidance. 26.
Kaladin Shash 00:52:42 Guided. Very guided. Oh yeah. So can we check the perimeter of the main chapel and see if there's some sort of basement where he does, I mean I guess he just sells stuff, he does not
Leopold Magnus 00:52:56 I want to ask him if he's seen something like that before. Or would we know? He would have already. He hasn't.
Kaladin Shash 00:53:21 I think he just was like, that's mine, but I've never made it that way. And he didn't really say anything about seeing it.
Dungeon Master 00:53:27 Yeah, he very obviously recognizes it, but he only recognizes it as a talisman that he's made. And obviously, after selling to however many people he sold these to, this one has got like the fingers bent forward.
Leopold Magnus 00:53:43 Right, okay, well, I'll offer. I was just gonna, before we leave, I was gonna offer him a gold and buy three of those talismans. Yeah, I'll just say keep the change, you've been very helpful.
Zariel Torgan 00:53:45 Do we oh, go ahead. Sorry
Dungeon Master 00:53:56 Uh, he goes to hand you back seven silver. I didn't even have to put on my show for most of this. You're going to give me, I mean like a fucking 210% tip. Are you sure?
Leopold Magnus 00:54:12 Why, yes, kind sir, you've been very generous with your information. And may I say, if you do come across anything suspicious, please let us know.
Dungeon Master 00:54:24 I mean, shit, will do. I'm going to take the day off. Hell. He just gave me a day's wages.
Zariel Torgan 00:54:29 Before he goes, can I ask, well, if somebody's ripping off your merchandise, I'd imagine they're probably buying more than one if they're making these fancy hands. Is there anybody that's a relatively new customer that's bought in bulk?
Zariel Torgan 00:54:54 that might stand out to you as a bit shadier than your average religious zealot.
Dungeon Master 00:54:55 And he's like picking up and packing up his cart, and he goes to lift it in like a deadlift sort of stance to get the wheels off the chucks. And then he looks at you, thinks for a moment, sits it down, and goes, sorry, sir, but honestly, no. The most I ever sell is a few to a family visit in town,
Kaladin Shash 00:55:12 moving forward.
Dungeon Master 00:55:25 Most people only need one, right? He sort of steps into the general flow of traffic and starts walking away.
Zariel Torgan 00:55:29 Very fair enough. I appreciate your time. Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 00:55:39 And then, I guess before we kind of take off, I was going to hopefully use the right tool for the job to kind of fashion these fingers on the badges, kind of bend them around, maybe some robot strength, so they look exactly like the other one.
Dungeon Master 00:56:00 I wouldn't. Again, you're strong, but you're not like strong enough to bend metal strong, especially like fingertips as much as the flavor is nice, but right tool from the job lets you create anything you'd need with enough time to do it. So as he's chatting, you're sort of fiddling with one of like your prods and you do a quick edge of like a controlled flame sort of spell at the tip.
Dungeon Master 00:56:26 And then like as he's walking away, you're holding in your hand, you create basically just like a non open flame porch kind of deal where like the end of the rod heats up almost to a burning red hot. And then you're able to like put that on the metal and as a heat seek mechanism, the fingers heat up to match. And then once they get hot enough, you take like one of your clamps and your pliers and you just sort of bend them each gently forward one at a time. Just something you're fiddling with as everybody's talking.
Dungeon Master 00:56:56 Easy enough to do.
Zariel Torgan 00:57:01 Perhaps... Yeah, I'll take one. Perhaps, um, if I look around, do I see a lot of times in, I mean, big religious pilgrimage areas, you can buy, like, you know, your tourist, like, toga to go do your worship. Is there some places that are selling just, like, cheap, like, throw over the top of everything, just, uh...
Leopold Magnus 00:57:02 Cool, yeah, pass them out.
Kaladin Shash 00:57:10 Remember this?
Zariel Torgan 00:57:31 you know, yeah, just something that's just, it's going to go over everything just cheap that I can just see that I'd like to buy for us. Guidance. That's a natural 20.
Dungeon Master 00:57:38 Mm-hmm. Yeah. Give me a perception check as you're sort of scanning. Yes, it is. Quickly, just a couple blocks down the street, you see. Let's see. I did not write her a description. A woman.
Kaladin Shash 00:57:53 Mm-hmm.
Dungeon Master 00:58:08 You know, it's unfair to do the classical fair, beautiful, but she's, I would say, a normal looking woman, average by all accounts, nothing super like, oh my God, she's the most attractive woman I've ever seen, but like, not ugly, just like very normal looking person in very basic garb, brown hair that lays flatly overhead, tied up tight on the back.
Kaladin Shash 00:58:26 you
Dungeon Master 00:58:37 She's got big brown eyes, a little bit of chubbiness to her cheeks, and she smiles pleasantly as you walk by. And you see that she has, in fact, got stacks of basic tan throwover robes for sale. And they say two silver apiece. You see one of her kids is sitting behind her stand playing with a couple little dolls. And she just seems very pleasant as you approach.
Kaladin Shash 00:59:10 you
Zariel Torgan 00:59:10 Do I see a ring on her finger? I won't guide myself. 19.
Dungeon Master 00:59:14 Okay, perceptive check. No guidance. You don't have time to guide yourself. 19, no ring on her finger, but you see, weirdly enough, she's got like a tan line where she was obviously wearing one until very recently.
Zariel Torgan 00:59:38 Well, me being the suave, charismatic person that I am, I'll just kind of make my way over, doing the old Midwest, oh, excuse me, oh, as I walk past the people in the crowd. Yeah, hello, my name's Zariel, and I couldn't help but notice you were.
Dungeon Master 00:59:58 Pleasure to meet you, Zario. I'm Serafina. Thank you. Thanks, you. This is Amber. Hi! This is my doll!
Zariel Torgan 01:00:04 It's a lovely name. And you've got some lovely children here. I'd like to buy... Oh, hello. Hi, Amber. I'll tell you what, I'll... Oh! It's a very nice doll.
Kaladin Shash 01:00:27 6-2.
Dungeon Master 01:00:30 His name is barry. He's pretty cool She goes anyway, um, are you interested in some cloaks?
Zariel Torgan 01:00:34 That's a lot of names to keep track of. All right. Absolutely. I'd like three, one really, really big, one normal sized, and I can't remember how tall Kaladin is. See, like kind of 6'2", and then one just a bit tall, like a large.
Dungeon Master 01:01:03 Um, this should do nicely. Um, it'll be six silver, please and thank you. No, I just, I've been sort of doing this since my husband passed.
Zariel Torgan 01:01:10 Do you have any marked up extra stuff that you sell that you make a bigger margin on? That is unfortunate. Hopefully he wasn't made of mushrooms.
Dungeon Master 01:01:32 Gotta pay the bills, you know. Huh? Thank you for your patronage. Hope to see you at the court.
Kaladin Shash 01:01:40 Excuse me.
Zariel Torgan 01:01:42 Anyway, I gotta go. Here's your money, and I'll take the cloaks and I'll just shuffle off. Very nervous. That's it. Stop, turn around. Where? Ah.
Dungeon Master 01:02:02 the Corte Verteo, the main chapel, the one we're right next to. Do you not also go here? Oh. Well, welcome. It's a pleasure to have you. I don't mean to persuade you, but honestly, the high cleric father
Zariel Torgan 01:02:10 I'm new to the faith. I've been on a long journey.
Dungeon Master 01:02:30 Calo, he's truly the best. Just get lost in his words almost. It's lovely. It's a nice wholesome experience and they've been very supportive of us and our time. They give us donations when they can and he saved me from becoming homeless.
Zariel Torgan 01:02:50 Well, that's nasty here. What's that? And I'm going to try to distract her and just put a little bit of money in a basket or the kid's pocket or something really easy. I have terrible sleight of hand.
Dungeon Master 01:03:02 So the kid is behind her, behind the thing. That'd be a tough ask to do. Yes, you can.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:15 Okay, so like if she's got like a coffee cup, yeah, I'll just leave it on the counter and just run Can I do that? Okay, I'm just I got a big giant armload of cloaks and I just like Holy look at oh my god. Is that God and then I just drop the money and just run just beat red
Kaladin Shash 01:03:17 Just leave it on the counter. Yeah. They look good.
Dungeon Master 01:03:37 Jesus.
Zariel Torgan 01:03:40 I got the cloaks, I got them right here. I got the cloaks right here. Here you go, let's go. Hand you guys the cloaks. Don't talk about it, let's just keep walking. She's a nice lady.
Leopold Magnus 01:03:48 Oh, Zariel, who was that fair lady you were discussing with? Oh, okay, well, it seemed like maybe you guys were hitting it off. A nice lady, indeed.
Kaladin Shash 01:03:48 I don't have to explain myself. I best stop asking so many questions.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:07 Very nice got a kid Yeah, I don't Yeah Yeah, let's let's uh, let's catch some bad guys or something I I don't like feeling this uncomfortable for this long
Kaladin Shash 01:04:20 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:04:29 I'm always uncomfortable. I'm a giant suit of armor. Do you think this thing is well-oiled? I'm just dabbing oil on one of the joints of my arms. It's a little creaky.
Dungeon Master 01:04:29 Okay. This is the silence.
Zariel Torgan 01:04:38 you wear it well.
Kaladin Shash 01:04:55 What was the name of the main clerk?
Dungeon Master 01:05:02 He's known as the High Cleric Father Kallor, K-A-L-L-O-R.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:21 throw my robe over, maybe pull the hood over my face? Is it possible to obscure my face? Or would that draw attention? OK. Yeah, is it possible, like, is leprosy a thing? Is this common to have people who are kind of
Dungeon Master 01:05:30 If you were to hear all of your face, it would look weird. Like, um, you know, if you were walking down the street and you saw somebody with like a full face covering cloak, it'd be, it would draw your eyes probably. No. No leprosy.
Leopold Magnus 01:05:51 covered in scabs that might need to bandage themselves up. OK. Yeah. I could just wear maybe some bandages on my face. I'm going to claim I'm a burn victim. Oh, he's back. OK. Yeah, so that's what we'll be going as.
Kaladin Shash 01:05:56 No.
Dungeon Master 01:06:09 I don't know where it just to go. Yeah, that could work. OK.
Zariel Torgan 01:06:21 And I think that Kaladin and I, I mean, do we, do you, Kaladin, do you want to like do something to try to make us look a little different or do you think we're just good enough the way we are? Yeah, same thing here with my armor. I think, I think I'll be covered up and then we'll just be good to go.
Kaladin Shash 01:06:34 No, I think as long as my my half plate's all covered, I'm fine. If I have a hood, do I have a hood or is it just robes? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:06:51 just ropes mostly but you guys like have hoods and stuff from other armor pieces that you could have like up also
Zariel Torgan 01:07:00 Yeah, but then the color wouldn't match. It would just look bad. So, did he give us, like, a direction of Jaith and Renan, and that, or he just mentioned it and we didn't follow up?
Kaladin Shash 01:07:23 No, he said that's common knowledge, the names, or that they're like the newer devil deities or what you call them.
Dungeon Master 01:07:31 Mm-hmm. They're in the age of the new ascension of the new heroes. While like, this is just like back lore, while trapped in the planes of hell and the planes of the abyss respectively, Jath and Renan overthrew the reigning hierarchs of those realms and basically were like the new Asmodeus and the new Demogorgon.
Zariel Torgan 01:07:31 Yeah, but did he tell us where they were?
Kaladin Shash 01:07:58 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:08:02 but they were defeated a long time ago. Not specifically, but there's less of those temples, so you guys could use your map to find some.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:03 But did this salesman tell us, like he obviously knew that there were these religious people. Did he say where in the Don district we could find them? I don't know, I feel like that's a decent start. What do you guys think?
Kaladin Shash 01:08:30 I'm on board.
Zariel Torgan 01:08:33 Yeah, I'll just work with Leo looking over the map. And then can I just try to look around and piece together where we are and try to find it? Guidance.
Dungeon Master 01:08:47 Yeah, go ahead and just give me a general, it could be like survival check, you know, managing the city as you sort of go through. 15, it takes you a little bit, but eventually you sort of find your way down, like,
Zariel Torgan 01:09:00 That is a 12 plus 15.
Dungeon Master 01:09:14 in this area of really bright light and everything is clean and it very much feels radiant and divine sort of a darker alleyway where you see some people in like darker cloaks talking and just low voices to each other you draw a little bit of attention at first but people seem to pay you no mind because it's sort of the if I don't overwatch you you won't overwatch me kind of non-verbal agreement you have in these kind of situations and as you guys sort of like slowly step
Dungeon Master 01:09:44 inside shoulder pass people you eventually come to like what is essentially that the hole in the wall of some broken down building that you can't see from the other side and like scratched into like a wood plaque at the very top says house of the devil.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:06 What do you boys think? Check it out or?
Kaladin Shash 01:10:11 We can check it out. I'm not certain yet.
Leopold Magnus 01:10:17 Daryl, I do wonder, do you think those cultists were more ideologists or devil worshipers? If you had to guess.
Dungeon Master 01:10:26 Right, next question.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:30 It seemed to me that they were more of the zealous type, which lends a bit more towards spirituality in a sense. It's hard to get that radical about an ideology unless there's a really big foundation. I'd guess, unless the hand of God is some sort of metaphor, that we're dealing with some sort of entity that they're gaining their powers from.
Zariel Torgan 01:10:59 But that's just all gut, all gut. It's possible, I would imagine, that we might have heard about them
Leopold Magnus 01:10:59 That's very, very astute. Yes, I think it's worth maybe making a cursory passover of this location, but I suppose that our suspects probably belong to a larger, more established religion base.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:27 being the, and I'll just whisper, Hand of God, if they were big enough to have a base that's large, they probably wouldn't be underground. My guess is we're looking for a very devout, small group. I'd like to use my ability Detect Basement.
Kaladin Shash 01:11:47 Love that.
Leopold Magnus 01:11:49 That's a great idea. Yeah, you should definitely be using that.
Zariel Torgan 01:11:53 Yeah, can I just look and see if this place looks like it has a basement, you know? Dirt floor, or what, is it stone? Oh, it is a basement?
Dungeon Master 01:12:02 But this place looks like it is a basement. Like, it's that grungy look that as soon as you go past sort of the shaded front, it's gonna be like stairs down, you know?
Kaladin Shash 01:12:17 It's a basement, let's check it out. Nothing else, we meet some new friends. I'm walking first.
Zariel Torgan 01:12:24 All right, who wants to lead? Do we wanna establish our fake characters now? That way we don't trip each other up in there. All right, I'm gonna be, I gotta get a scarier name. So I'll be Terrence. It's like terror, but Terrence.
Leopold Magnus 01:12:55 Quite good, quite good, Zariel. I think that my name... Huh? What? Who? Oh! Oh dear, yes. Terrence. That is quite astute a name of you, Terrence. I think I'm going to... Um, I think I'm going to go by Fred? That seems pretty, pretty, pretty scary, don't you think?
Zariel Torgan 01:12:58 Like, you know, I would say we're going to get in character. You got to call me Terrence. Yes. Thank you. And what about you?
Zariel Torgan 01:13:27 I couldn't agree more. What about you? Well, dig deep and pull out that big Fred energy. See if we can make something happen. What about you, Kaladin? What do you want to be? Killer Kal. All right.
Leopold Magnus 01:13:29 There was this one boy on my primary school team named Fred. He was quite the bully.
Kaladin Shash 01:13:47 You just call me Cal.
Zariel Torgan 01:13:55 Well, let's do it. And I'll bring up the rear just so I can make sure nobody's closing in on us or anything like that.
Dungeon Master 01:14:08 Yeah, you do a brief look. It doesn't seem like anybody's paying you attention as you guys sort of like. Die almost delve into this just building, but as you go past the main sort of shrouded blackout curtains, there's no natural light in here. It does indeed descend down some stairs. Stone pillars mark the end as it sort of goes to the open courtyard or. Wrong word common room of this.
Dungeon Master 01:14:37 House of worship and you see everybody's in dark looks the people who don't have like red makeup drawn and smeared down their face as they just give you a look in the breathy. Exhale not really making words but each of them and like their private sort of alter seem to be just sort of in there. Whatever rituals they do here.
Dungeon Master 01:15:01 obviously doesn't all seem super kosher, but none of it looks outright. They're not doing human sacrifice or anything like that. As you guys sort of keep your heads low and you're looking around, you see there is a figure in the center who does take notice, a particularly tall, like almost, can't be but like seven foot, lie, thin individual, gaunt face, sunken eyes, completely bald, just smooth head.
Dungeon Master 01:15:31 perfectly round with like nubbed ears, not particularly large. Their nose is a little small and points up a bit. And you see this picture moves unnaturally smooth towards you, not a whole lot of up and down in their step. And before you know it, they're right in front of you. And they go, good afternoon. I walk you through this house. I am Varik.
Kaladin Shash 01:16:00 Hello, Varek. We are new to this house. Perhaps you can give us an introductory tour.
Zariel Torgan 01:16:09 Mmm. Mmm.
Dungeon Master 01:16:11 I'd love to. To have found it, you probably are aware that our choice of worship is, of course, Rean and Lord of Destruction. Looks at you waiting.
Kaladin Shash 01:16:38 We know this, yes, yes.
Dungeon Master 01:16:43 Alright, just don't want you to be in the wrong place. Pardon me, and a creepy wide grin stretches across their face. Um, the tour is... I'm not going to lie, a weird ask. Has anybody told you that? But, uh, I digress. I can show you the history. Always welcome a new follower. And you see they walk you down sort of the perimeter at these sort of paintings and murals and depictions. You see...
Dungeon Master 01:17:13 A figure shrouded in dark smoke and black fire, bright lights coming from the insides of the armor of this former-like demon that was Rinan. There are pictures of them sitting in like a throne-like chair, leg crossed in black obsidian armor, looking in deep thought, piercing red eyes and a crown of fire above their head.
Dungeon Master 01:17:38 You see other depictions of them in a fight, a fight against Jafe depicting some end of war battle. You see them in a fight against what appears to be the prime deities and striking down what is like commonly depicted as what Beteo looks like, this more androgynous person of like black woman of color is how they presented more than anything. And you see this depiction of Reenan is like,
Dungeon Master 01:18:06 blazing fire out between the armors and underneath this huge flaming spear in one hand and this huge morning star in the other foot on their chest. And it seems like as Vitae was being honestly looks like they're being murdered in this scene, but the painting itself is burned and is like it's being destroyed and preserved here is a depiction of some glorious battle. You see, uh, like,
Dungeon Master 01:18:33 skulls on shelves with candles melting on top. Some of them look very human and normal, like the common and do than people. But then you see some that are like elongated snouts and fanged teeth. I'm not sure what it looks like. It's humanoid, but it's like, would be what you imagine a vampire skull is like, like somebody has some monster skull. And so they're just walking you through giving you this history.
Dungeon Master 01:19:01 when this cathedral sort of came into place, the safe harbor it provides for those who want to worship the god of their choice without the judgmental eye of the council. Doesn't like through the obviously not going to be like in here we do human sacrifice and in this door we do illegal stuff but like the presentation is more doesn't strike you as like overly
Kaladin Shash 01:19:16 Bye.
Dungeon Master 01:19:30 angry and it it doesn't really even seem to encapsulate the views of what you imagine the devil would be it seems like this is just a harbor for people to escape the the holy uh order of bateo and ica and fate and all that stuff it's just like uh you know a getaway not a getaway you know what i mean like a safe harbor for alternative deity
Kaladin Shash 01:19:59 Yeah. You seem quite nice here. Very nice people. Can I do a little look over? Do I see any hand of God stuff with fingers curled? I don't need it. I don't need it. Yeah. Critical fail.
Zariel Torgan 01:20:04 Guidance.
Dungeon Master 01:20:09 Go ahead and give me an investigation. You don't see any.
Kaladin Shash 01:20:29 Of course I don't. I'm not sure. It's very dimly lit apparently.
Leopold Magnus 01:20:31 So the club that I spent a bit of time in partying at, would there be any overlap with that type of crowd here at this church?
Dungeon Master 01:20:40 The club that you were in briefly before being in the Storm District probably would have had mostly followers of Ika as like Ika was the goddess of storms and nature. And so like that district tends to be like the exception of the rule where Ika's followers mostly reside in the Storm District.
Dungeon Master 01:21:10 You don't see a whole lot. I mean, in theory it could be, you know, people openly worship Ika and then secret worship Rinan kind of deal. He had, like, plastic teeth in. The impression you got of him was, like, rave nerd virgin kind of deal. Like, he was just weird. He had, like,
Leopold Magnus 01:21:10 Got it. Right, this wasn't the guy that I came across in the line. Didn't he have vampire teeth in? That made it look like he had vampire teeth or?
Kaladin Shash 01:21:30 Great.
Dungeon Master 01:21:38 wolf ears on like furs and he was like in leather we'll go like athlete's chaps kind of attire like not not necessarily like the soul for this it is absolutely possible
Leopold Magnus 01:21:41 Right. So maybe in a counterculture type of way, he might identify with the darkness of this establishment. Got it.
Zariel Torgan 01:21:41 Hm. And I, I mean,
Zariel Torgan 01:22:06 I don't think we have any reason to believe this is the place. This seems to be more of a melting pot. I think I'll just kind of, like, give a little bit of a nod, like, my head back towards the door. I'll try to be subtle, I don't want to hurt this dude's feelings, but it seems like we need to keep moving.
Kaladin Shash 01:22:09 No. I agree. I think perhaps we do need to go into the main temple and perhaps from within there we will find more information.
Leopold Magnus 01:22:37 Yeah, I agree. I think we need to go into the temple and maybe just be observant, looking for that symbol in particular, or maybe just kind of pass around enough places that we could come by it. Something to cue us in.
Kaladin Shash 01:22:50 Right there, look for them. We'll put them on as we go in.
Zariel Torgan 01:22:50 And there's, yeah, and there's also a chance that, you know, he gives the talent, you know, with air quotes, this symbol to hold so that they know who's who. It probably wouldn't hurt just to, yeah, just like walk around with it. Yeah, yeah, just walk around and be like, you know,
Leopold Magnus 01:23:13 Yeah. Oh, my perception is terrible.
Zariel Torgan 01:23:16 talking loud and just maybe like a couple of us walking out in front and then like one person watching the crowd from behind or something like that? Yeah. Mine's plus five.
Kaladin Shash 01:23:24 I imagine, I imagine Leopold can handle talking loudly and drawing attention. What's, how's your perception? How is, how is Ariel, how is yours? Okay, so maybe you should be, maybe you should be lurking. I think you've got the best perception.
Zariel Torgan 01:23:46 Yeah, I figure I'll walk behind you guys like 30 or 50 feet, maybe. Maybe a little closer in case something goes wrong. I'll be like 30 feet back, and then I can just be scanning the crowd as you guys walk through holding up your hands. I'll give my...
Kaladin Shash 01:23:54 Okay. I like this idea to put my amulet in an obvious place around my neck over robe.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:17 Well, actually, we all have enough for everybody to have one, so I'll just tuck mine away. That way they don't look for me. Well, Fred and Cal, this might be a little too much for me on the day of our Lord.
Leopold Magnus 01:24:26 Catch mind in my belt, just kind of dangling around.
Zariel Torgan 01:24:43 Uh, we gotta get back for Grammy's luncheon. Uh... Shit. Yeah, I'm just gonna leave.
Kaladin Shash 01:24:54 we can we all leave thank you so much tall thin man did we catch his name
Dungeon Master 01:25:02 Varic. Pleasure. I have an allergy to natural sunlight. I blister. Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 01:25:07 Well, Varek, I do suggest you get outside sometime. I think you could use a little vitamin D, if you know what I mean. Oh, oh dear. Can I make a, I don't know about insight, but like a way, is there a way to maybe determine whether that's an allergy or if he's a vampire?
Zariel Torgan 01:25:24 That's hardcore. Vitamin D check. I already left, so I can't help you.
Leopold Magnus 01:25:38 Yeah, like an arcana check maybe. Medicine maybe, I don't know. Not sure if we. OK. Hey, here we go 23.
Kaladin Shash 01:25:38 This is.
Dungeon Master 01:25:49 Uh, yeah. Could do either Arcana or Medicine, I guess. Uh, 23, pretty good. Um, just a really pale dude. Nothing really going on here. No.
Zariel Torgan 01:26:00 Nice. I mean, murder him just in case.
Leopold Magnus 01:26:14 Got it. Okay. So it's not like maybe he's a vampire. Now, now, sorry, you better calm down. Got it.
Kaladin Shash 01:26:27 Listen. Let's let us go. Right?
Zariel Torgan 01:26:27 Oh no, I already left, that's just me. That's just me as a player. Yeah, I scurried outside. I gotta stop trying to talk.
Leopold Magnus 01:26:53 So we're walking kind of down the main square now.
Dungeon Master 01:26:54 Yeah. Yeah, as you guys make your way towards the main chapel, just sort of walking down the street trying to be noticed, go ahead and you can give me a perception check to see the symbol and
Kaladin Shash 01:27:02 As we're going, can I just kind of perception check looking for this variation of the iconography of the Hindu god? Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:27:20 It sounds like Zariel is looking to make a perception check to see if you guys are being like tailed at some point.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:27 Yeah, I just, I don't know if I need to be like constantly rolling or I just want to be actively scanning the crowd to see if anybody picks up on the two of them walking with the hands.
Leopold Magnus 01:27:39 And I'm going to make a performance check. And as we're walking, I'm going to be talking to Cal, and I'll say, well, after those burns hit my face, I haven't been able to do anything. It's been awful. This is some of the worst, worst pain I've ever been in. Thank God Viteo saved me from my wretched squalor in that dirty alley.
Zariel Torgan 01:27:58 Thanks.
Dungeon Master 01:28:07 You hear somebody go, oh man, from down like that street. As you sort of are moving down towards the Chapel of Caledon, you know, a 22 is good. You are fairly certain you're not missing something. Again, this is a busy main throwaway. There are a lot of people moving back and forth, but you're scanning waistlines and necklines and you're looking for
Dungeon Master 01:28:31 Any sort of variation, and it's kind of hard from this sort of distance to gauge, like, if the fingers on the talismans are slightly bent or not, but you're pretty sure you're not seeing any. Leopold, you're being pretty loud and obnoxious, but you're not sure, I think, personally aware as if it's, like, effective or not, but you are successfully sort of drawing attention to yourselves.
Kaladin Shash 01:28:43 Right. Tell me more about the burns on your face, friend.
Zariel Torgan 01:28:55 Hmph.
Dungeon Master 01:29:04 Sorry, you made a tech save.
Leopold Magnus 01:29:06 Oh, I was trapped in that burning library for hours with the shelf laying on top of me, smoldering. It's a wonder I made it out.
Kaladin Shash 01:29:21 There's a phrase, Oteo. You know what's that for? Okay. Guide yourself, please.
Zariel Torgan 01:29:29 Yeah. Sorry. I was just, I was just trying to see something on here, but it's, it's not relevant. Um, yeah, I was just, yeah, I was, I wasn't sure if you wanted me to, when you wanted me to, I was going to guide myself to, um, if I can. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:29:37 Go ahead and give me that perception check that you never made one. I will say guidance applies to a specific action. Generally watching to see if your friends are being followed is more of like an ongoing thing. So I'm not going to do guidance on this one. 19, that was good.
Zariel Torgan 01:30:00 That's fair. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:30:05 You are not seeing anything. It seems like as you're heading to the main chapel, everybody's sort of heading in a similar direction. But at this point, you're sort of staying back 20 or so feet, just sort of trying to blend in and watch. You're not getting any like they're being tailed by three specific people. It's just like nothing sort of going on right now. OK, and you guys have sort of.
Leopold Magnus 01:30:29 So should we walk towards a mass like a service?
Dungeon Master 01:30:32 Yeah, that's it. You guys have done all your sort of checks. And so now, as you're sort of heading to the main chapel, you do hear people are quieting down taking their seats, they have the option of going in, you have a chance to talk before but like this, you see like in chiseled marble over the archway of the double doors, it says,
Zariel Torgan 01:30:44 You know,
Dungeon Master 01:30:51 Court of Viteo Holy House. And you see like a lot of people are going in, there's somebody giving donations at the door. You see that short old guy is like out on the corner again, sees you guys, sort of waves excitedly, but then goes back to his sort of thing of getting people to buy these talismans before they go in. And you guys have the chance to go in.
Leopold Magnus 01:31:13 On. Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 01:31:16 You know, out of, uh, out of game, I don't know if, uh, it's very possible that they are worshiping like Viteo, but they're just like crazy people. You know, it's a, it's a warped Viteo symbol. So maybe, maybe you guys are right. Maybe they are just in the basement of the main area. So yeah, let's go in there and check it out.
Kaladin Shash 01:31:31 Yeah. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:31:42 Yeah, I was thinking they were definitely related. Maybe not necessarily of this main, but you know, like French, French group type. Yeah. Yeah, so I'm going to enter the chapel. And are they are they pews? What's the layout of the church?
Zariel Torgan 01:31:46 Yeah. Yeah. No, I think you're absolutely right.
Dungeon Master 01:32:07 Let me show you. As you guys step into this truly massive vaulted ceilings, you hear a faint just sort of thrumming and humming of just like holy, almost like halo-esque music of just up and down the scales in Gregorian chant in the background.
Kaladin Shash 01:32:09 Let us go to the church.
Dungeon Master 01:32:36 As you guys sort of step in, you see that there are some open seats, but Leopold, being in his large size, walks up and sits directly between two people a couple rows in on the right. The person next to you gives you a big shush with the finger up to their lips. The sermon starts.
Leopold Magnus 01:32:49 I sit down and go, oh, my wretched bones, Mateo, justice and wrath, give me, give me. I'm sorry, sorry, my burns cause me awful pain anytime I sit. And I try to quiet down, but you can still hear me wince.
Dungeon Master 01:33:06 Somebody else shushes you. Have some manners. He's really messing it up, you guys. He's making a lot of noise in this very quiet room.
Leopold Magnus 01:33:23 I'm gonna do another performance check to see how that goes. 13.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:26 Better. I will sit somewhere else. Let's see.
Kaladin Shash 01:33:37 Yeah, I just quietly walk over to the first seat.
Dungeon Master 01:33:48 Zaria, where do you want to see? The other one hasn't set themselves. In this large crowd, give me just a perception check. Don't want to. Okay, she went to the open seating. All right, 24, you do see them. They're up at the front.
Zariel Torgan 01:33:53 Oh. Yeah, sorry. Um... Uh, I don't see the girl with her kids, right? Oh, I-I don't wanna s- I don't wanna see them. Yeah, I just- I- Oh, shit.
Kaladin Shash 01:34:12 But you see them. But you see them.
Zariel Torgan 01:34:19 Alright, I'm just gonna try to make sure I don't catch their eye line and I'll sit back over here.
Dungeon Master 01:34:25 you quietly sit down and in the group of a hundred or so people who are filtering in, blending is not an issue unless you're really making a lot of noise. And then this old frail figure, he's got like poofs of gray hair that stick up at the sides as he's sort of walking and he's sort of smacking his lips, stands at the altar. And a very popular figure in the community, this is,
Dungeon Master 01:34:54 who everybody sort of refers to as High Cleric Father Kalor.
Dungeon Master 01:35:00 Uh, his eyes hang low, his top brow sinking over, his bushy eyebrows also sort of making it, you wonder how he sees anything at all. He's in these large, thick, like, gray-brown robes that hang. He's got a large tome in his hand with chains to attach. Uh, a very religious zealot-looking figure, wise and sage in his years. As he steps up, and he goes, oh, calm down.
Dungeon Master 01:35:29 And the whole room sort of shush and you have some murmurs and he starts this sermon and he mostly just talks about the blessings and As he's sort of droning on about you know that values and all that You guys are kind of getting bored. You're looking around. You're not really seeing anything Uh, if everyone wants to give me a perception check while he's talking go for it But he continues on
Dungeon Master 01:35:53 And then at some point, he gets to. OK. Nice. 19, 24. Yeah, I'm not going to make you roll for it, because they are just, in fact, some normal people next to you. They seem like they're sitting next to him.
Zariel Torgan 01:35:54 Guidance.
Leopold Magnus 01:35:58 Can I, instead of trying to look around the whole room, just kind of take a quick detailed look at the people sitting next to me? Got it. Is that a woodcutter? Got it.
Dungeon Master 01:36:21 Those are just basic commoner tokens, they're nothing too special. But you see them, they seem, you know, watching him intently, appreciating the things he's saying. At certain points, they nod their heads in agreement, or if the high father's talking about vandalists sabotaging the gardens in the courtyard, they shake their heads, you know, angrily at the whole thing, and it comes to a down. Eventually, the father's like,
Dungeon Master 01:36:50 Alright, you've all been so wonderful. We'll end this all the same way. As many of you know, I am running for council seat as soon as the current religious district council member passes. Unfortunately, it seems like it'll be rather soon and has failed in age. Currently, the council is represented by ICA, but I am confident with this cycle that I can get
Dungeon Master 01:37:20 A word of Ateo into our high council of this great city. I count on your support in continued times against these attacks of these religious folk desecrating the name of our gods. And he starts talking about some of the recent attacks and he goes into detail about how it seems like they are desecrating the symbol of Ateo in an attempt to mask themselves
Dungeon Master 01:37:49 And he goes, I encourage you of any information on this matter. I am working closely with our legionnaire to get to the bottom of this. I will not stand for it. And he sort of raises his fist shakily in the air. And he goes, I also implore you to look for our missing folk. The city often forgets about our underfed, but I haven't had as many of our less fortunate people visiting for donations or rations recently.
Dungeon Master 01:38:18 I am concerned about their well-being, so please keep an eye out. And he starts listing off some names of a dozen or so people who have just stopped showing up. And it does happen for us. It's like common knowledge. If you starve to death, you're not going to show up anymore. But the list does seem a little long. And eventually, everybody sort of says a prayer together, and everybody starts to get up and walk away, sort of exiting the building in between these sermons.
Zariel Torgan 01:38:48 When he's listing off the names, can I watch the lady to see if one of them seems like it's her husband? Like if she reacts. Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:38:59 You were listening, and none of the names that he lists in this moment seem to be her husband. No. Not from reactions, at least.
Leopold Magnus 01:39:07 And I, yeah, I was all along that same vein, wondering if when he's talking about, you know, the religious nuts that are vandalizing the temple and stuff, does anyone look a little shifty or uneasy, you know, maybe like they don't agree with what he's saying? Ah, there it is. There's going to be a one that rolled over.
Zariel Torgan 01:39:28 Ooh, good call. Nice.
Dungeon Master 01:39:29 Sort of doing that. My pain. You're looking at, you see some people seem sort of like an anxious look comes across your face and it's
Kaladin Shash 01:39:34 Yes.
Dungeon Master 01:39:48 hard to tell if like it's the setting of like oh yeah talk about scary people that's scary or if it's like oh man people are out to get me but there are a couple people who look unsettled by the mention of these sort of religious folk and these zealots but with the 19 you actually see sitting in one of the rows
Dungeon Master 01:40:10 Up over here is none other than Cedric, who the fighter you met at the pit seems to be listening intently, holding just like, from this it's hard to tell, but it looks like just like another symbol of a tail, maybe his personal one or something. But it does seem in fact that he attends this chapel.
Leopold Magnus 01:40:34 And did he look like he shifted a bit when he was talking about that? Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:40:37 No, he seems just sort of in his own pair. Maybe not necessarily listening to this one, but he is in this place to worship. You don't...
Zariel Torgan 01:40:47 Can I, while everybody's still seated before everybody gets up and it's hard to see, can I see if there's any like side doors or entrances or stairwells that look like they go down?
Dungeon Master 01:41:04 You can go ahead. You don't need to make it because there's obviously nothing in here. But you do remember that when you had walked up to the chapel, there was like another couple set of doors on the side of each of the building that seemed to lead somewhere else. And it looks like the building is wider on the outside than you are seeing in here.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:26 care.
Leopold Magnus 01:41:29 We're kind of shuffling around here like everyone's leaving. So that's the idea. OK, I kind of I'm going to try and be subtle, but I'm going to try and kind of tap Zaria on the shoulder here and not point, but gesture kind of my head and maybe a little bit of body language that Cedric or he should look over in the corner over here.
Dungeon Master 01:41:34 Yeah, everybody's sort of getting up in ass.
Zariel Torgan 01:41:56 I, uh, follow his gesture and he catches my eye line. I give a nod of recognition. I writ.
Leopold Magnus 01:42:05 And then I'll kind of filter out muttering to myself about how awful these burns are and how bad it hurts and how much my life sucks. Tell them that Tao came and saved me.
Dungeon Master 01:42:20 I was looking at Monk's music, but that's a little too dark, I think.
Zariel Torgan 01:42:26 I really want to just like, loudly say like, Hey, that dude's a robot, right? I just how much you're hamming that up. Shit. Um, do you guys think we should
Kaladin Shash 01:42:34 Oh.
Leopold Magnus 01:42:38 Yeah, I think I've rolled very poorly on my performance checks too. I'm sure the bandages are starting to slip a bit. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:42:50 yeah like one of his joints and cog wheel sets like releases pressure
Zariel Torgan 01:42:59 Do you guys think we should try to talk to the father? I mean, he's saying he's closely working with them. I imagine he made a complaint and that's why we're here. Do you want to see if he can get us access or do you want to just do it on ourselves?
Kaladin Shash 01:43:17 I think we could inquire about missing persons and tell him what. Well, we could see if we can be really honest, hopefully is and then we can talk about. What we may already know about this extremist group practicing. Yeah, I mean, we can say that we've just, you know, we've just reported.
Leopold Magnus 01:43:30 Yeah. Maybe we try to be, like, a little bit agey. Not necessarily, like, just lay all the cards on the table. Yeah, yeah, maybe we can get a read better on his opinions.
Kaladin Shash 01:43:47 from the Legionnaires about maybe some of these missing persons as well and we're just following through.
Zariel Torgan 01:43:53 Yeah. All right, well, I'm going to try to head up and catch the father. Usually, I mean, people are probably trying to talk to him a bunch. I guess I'll just wait in line, make sure I don't miss him if he has like a back door or something. I'll head up to the front.
Dungeon Master 01:44:11 Yeah, I mean, just like your first idea, it seems to be the former than the latter. It seems to be like taking questions and comments and giving reassurances to people on a line, so you sort of get in a line. And eventually, you sort of pop up, and it goes, Aaron, nice not to meet you, my child. And he goes to like, brace you on the shoulder nicely.
Zariel Torgan 01:44:35 Uh, hello. Hello, father. Um, you guys are with me, right? I'm not alone. Am I the talker? What's going on here? Okay. Kaladin, did you come up with me or are you hanging back? Okay. I'm going to defer to, to Kaladin for speaking roles.
Leopold Magnus 01:44:43 I think that I was keeping a bit of distance that way it wasn't obvious we were together. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 01:44:54 I would have shadowed with you. I'll shadow behind you. I have I have. I have I have. I have no bonus and I think. I think Zario is negative one, yeah?
Dungeon Master 01:45:04 I think you both have the same bonus, don't you? I think Leopold has the best. OK, all three of you are in line then.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:08 There's no way, my Christmas dog shit. I'm negative. Yeah.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:10 I think, funny enough, I might have the same, Kaladin and I. Oh yeah, I have plus two. Oh my God, all right, all right. So I'll kind of come up here with them then.
Kaladin Shash 01:45:24 There you go. On our way up there, I would have whispered to Leopold on the way up. Tone it down a little bit, my friend. Don't talk about your burns.
Leopold Magnus 01:45:47 Oh, oh, yes, indeed. Maybe I should. Yes, of course. Sure, certainly. And then I'll approach with the group.
Zariel Torgan 01:45:58 Yes, father. And. Yeah, I'll let Leo talk. Since he's up here now.
Kaladin Shash 01:46:12 Priceless. I didn't know you were a plus two on charisma. I love it.
Leopold Magnus 01:46:15 Didn't I didn't know I was the highest because I feel like that shouldn't be the highest Yeah, that's hilarious Yeah, so I'll approach the father and I'll say way yes father you know as a humble member of your flock and Secondarily a member of the stonewall Legionnaires. We are here to assist you and anything you might need and
Zariel Torgan 01:46:39 Eat. I felt.
Dungeon Master 01:46:43 you see at the mention of legionnaires his back straightens a little bit and he goes oh soldiers made it here right my complaint was heard thank you for tail he goes uh are you here on a official business give me a deception check
Leopold Magnus 01:47:00 Why, yes, sir, and also personal, because I am quite a beloved follower of Viteo. Oh, yeah, that's not good. Can it be a performance?
Kaladin Shash 01:47:01 Live.
Zariel Torgan 01:47:11 Oh, Jesus. Can I roll something better?
Dungeon Master 01:47:18 No. Nine. He just raises an eyebrow for a moment and he goes, son, there's no need to lie in the house of the gods. Follow who you want and who you will. It's their way. This just happens to be who I choose to place my faith in. He goes, but please, not a moment.
Dungeon Master 01:47:48 to waste. Tell me if you have information updates. Is there something we can do? He goes, my faith and everybody go ahead and give me a
Leopold Magnus 01:47:59 Well, as you know, sir, there have been reports of some cultists who are linked to your faith. And so we are understanding maybe where their bouts are, if that makes sense.
Dungeon Master 01:48:16 either insight or perception checks to see like around the room just to see as you're having this conversation out in public if somebody's like taking notice. Which is good.
Zariel Torgan 01:48:30 Jesus, Callan, you're kicking ass.
Kaladin Shash 01:48:32 I'm getting lucky on these passive checks. I'm going to catch this on the Cleric's face.
Dungeon Master 01:48:40 Kaladin, you catch a look of surprise at the mention that it is, like the Legionnaire has knowledge this much, like maybe he didn't know that you had learned so much about it already, and you're not sure if it's like he feels out of the loop or something, but he just like, you say, you guys are like, yeah, people are impersonating followers of Mateo, and it's like instant reaction of like, really?
Kaladin Shash 01:49:12 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 01:49:13 And he sees that he sort of levels back out and he goes, interesting. It's worse than I thought. Please come with me. And we'll just put you guys there. He's got a little office space back here that I've got in shadow. I'll reveal it. You guys are sort of like finishes talking with people, has you hang out for a moment.
Dungeon Master 01:49:36 all of you sort of he is sort of ushers you back he like hobbles and walks uh excitedly in a like a walking cane back into the hallway you guys would see like right here is a door that he takes you to and that leads all the way around to that office space so uh he takes you back there and he goes please please have a seat and then he starts pour some tea doesn't even ask if you want some he just you know politely gonna offer it sits down he goes
Dungeon Master 01:50:04 And you see, as he talks in private, his posture is much straighter. It's not straight, but he, you definitely get the sense and it'd be like a great, not a great, an easy one, two, three logic process step of being like, oh, he's maybe hamming up his like gentleness in old age because he is going for essentially what is the equivalent of like a public office, right? Like he,
Dungeon Master 01:50:32 He's trying to gain favor of everybody. And maybe this is he figured being the nicest possible person he can is the best way to do it. But he's he's just a little straighter up in his chair, his brow first. But even then, you see more of his eyes because it's not quite as drooped over as when he's giving his like speech in front of all the people when he goes. I had. I thought as much when some of the poor folks stop, stop showing up at first, you know, you think the worst and then
Dungeon Master 01:51:02 two or three at a time don't show up and it's, I just, I don't, it's, I don't understand what, what the prompt it is, if that makes sense. It's, you know, why am I here? But he goes, I did have a feeling that it was happening in this area, this sort of, I just didn't know it was Vitello specifically. What have you learned? Is there,
Dungeon Master 01:51:33 Is the Legionnaire planning on doing something or can you not tell me is it covert or is there something going on though? It didn't seem like it.
Leopold Magnus 01:51:40 I guess before we get too far along for the perception check to see if anyone had picked up on their conversation and rolled it. Okay, cool.
Zariel Torgan 01:51:53 Did I, was I able to get from the crowd to the back office without that lady and her kid seeing me? Okay. No, no, I wanna, no. Father, do we, do you have, oh.
Dungeon Master 01:52:01 Yeah, unless you want that to be an issue, I wasn't going to make it an issue. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 01:52:16 any sort of catacombs or underground access points from the main chapel here. I attack.
Dungeon Master 01:52:27 And he goes, underground system. Sorry, that was me coughing out the character. It's just so you don't overlook and do it. Training my voice as he's speaking because no, this chapel is actually one of the fortunate few where it's main level only. It's there was a chapel that had burnt down at some time prior, but to my knowledge, the only underground system is in the back courtyard. There's a.
Kaladin Shash 01:52:34 Okay.
Dungeon Master 01:52:56 Like just a grave catacombs where we store like our funeral rites. People get waiting to get buried out in their chosen locations. But there are, I mean, underground pathways that run through the city. I guess it's possible that something runs through here.
Zariel Torgan 01:53:17 Hmm.
Kaladin Shash 01:53:18 Could we have access to the graveyard?
Dungeon Master 01:53:26 Uh, yeah. Uh, you, you, I'm sorry, you asking this? It goes, Oh, of course. Uh, anything for your investigation? He goes, uh, there are some groundskeepers that shouldn't let you in. Uh, I have a set of keys, but there, uh, I just don't have them on me at this moment, but, uh, there are staff of the chapel who do manage it. Just let them know. I sent them your way. Uh, but nothing, nothing you can tell me otherwise. Uh,
Leopold Magnus 01:53:56 When I walk into his back room here, can I make a quick maybe investigation and see if I see anything interesting at his desk or in the room? No, I'm not going to rifle. I'm just going to glance. Maybe he's left some paperwork out. Got it. OK.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:05 I'm just rifling for death. Um...
Dungeon Master 01:54:10 This is one of those situations where it's just the map doing you dirty. There's not like a desk with things that you can look into, nothing planned. There's just, main thing is this is just a private space to talk.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:25 Are we cool with telling him that we've heard that they're working out of the basement of a chapel and that, are we cool with asking him if he has an idea of like rundown chapel that might not have great security or anything that, you know, are we cool with asking him that? Yeah. Like as a possibility.
Kaladin Shash 01:54:44 Yeah, let's. Yeah, you can post that. I wouldn't say that we know for certain that's a thing. I would just ask it vaguely. And as he does that. Yeah, and then can I watch his reaction again as I picked up? Previously, as we discussed certain things.
Leopold Magnus 01:54:59 Yeah. I was going to say we should maybe ask him also if he has any idea where the other folks, the parish, the parish is gone. Like maybe they're getting like drawn away by another church. If there's like rumors of that in the parish.
Zariel Torgan 01:54:59 Okay. Well, father, uh,
Kaladin Shash 01:55:14 Alright.
Zariel Torgan 01:55:27 One of my personal pet theories is that perhaps these warped worshippers are trying to perhaps use one of your less secure chapels, maybe an attic or a basement or some sort of other adjacent area. Do you know of any chapels that might have an adjacent space that
Zariel Torgan 01:55:55 offhand you can think of that might be a bit less secure.
Dungeon Master 01:56:01 and goes, uh, thinks about it for a second ago. So there's a, I mean, a few of the ones that don't get as much service nowadays. I hear from my fellow holy folk that they're just not as much drawn in the masses that sort of matches it. And he'll like point out in your map, a couple of locations, a point of clarification. Do you guys have the sort of twisted talismans out on display still?
Kaladin Shash 01:56:31 Yes.
Leopold Magnus 01:56:34 Yeah, I think I kind of have it on my belt. Maybe I'll gesture to it to describe if he's ever seen that symbol.
Dungeon Master 01:56:34 OK. And again, he examines it the same as before.
Zariel Torgan 01:56:42 He's carrying around upside-down crucifixes in a church.
Dungeon Master 01:56:54 There's like the confirmation of a suspicion, kind of look on his face. Kaladin, since you sort of caught it before, you can give me another insight check and you can do it with advantage.
Kaladin Shash 01:57:07 Awesome. Two nines, that's a bummer.
Dungeon Master 01:57:22 Yeah, that's pretty average. Same sort of thing. You know, there's not anything more you can lean off of it. It seems he's observing it and there's frustration in his face that it happened to be like something that affected him more than he wanted it to. Now that like, you know, he's got this public office thing, so like he's reminiscing, he's talking to himself and he's like, I really hope you guys can all fix this so that people won't trust that
Dungeon Master 01:57:51 the followings of a tale and I don't want to lose those that we've gotten so far. And I was really hoping we could use this to change this part of the city. I mean, we got we have so many. Unfortunately, it just keeps going on these rambling. He goes, yeah, sorry. Feel free to check out the grounds, the father at this. And he points that one thing again.
Dungeon Master 01:58:20 uh the other chaplain he's like this one is a friend of mine is his name is drezio um and this one is uh father sable uh just let them know that father calor sent you they shouldn't give you too much trouble if you want to look around but what you're saying is true it's it possible that they can't be trusted is that what you're getting at
Kaladin Shash 01:58:39 Can you interpret it however you'd like? Is there an item you could give us so that we can show them that we know you, so they will aid us more easily?
Zariel Torgan 01:58:53 Good answer.
Dungeon Master 01:59:02 gives a wheezy little laugh, right? Well, he passes like very basic outfit, and he goes, I wish there was something, but I keep as little as I can between me and my prayers. I mean, there. So he goes, I thought I was giving that to you when I told you that you could just drop my name.
Kaladin Shash 01:59:12 Perhaps a nice little letter. A short note, my friend.
Dungeon Master 01:59:32 I could write you a letter too. Seems a little irritated. You're making him do extra work. Starts writing out some stuff. Hastily scribbling a letter. He writes out the letter. Gives it to you guys. This will do if word doesn't.
Zariel Torgan 01:59:40 He doesn't know how to write.
Kaladin Shash 01:59:46 I put one. I put I put I put I put one gold in like the poor donation box on the wall. Very slowly, just keeping eye contact with him. Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:00:01 His head is still hung up in the air, chin raised like, is that all?
Zariel Torgan 02:00:09 I'll step forward and I'll say, I'll take out 10 gold. And I'll say, there's a lady in your group who recently lost her husband. She's got a daughter. This is so that they can keep off the streets. And I'll just set it on the little desk if he's got one.
Dungeon Master 02:00:44 Yeah. Love it, love it, love it. Are you guys gonna sort of step out at this point? You'd have to like go out of the building and then into like, there's like a gated
Leopold Magnus 02:00:54 Yeah, I think so.
Zariel Torgan 02:00:54 Yeah, I'll just turn and sprint out. Oh yeah, good call.
Kaladin Shash 02:00:55 Yeah. I want to check out the grounds. Is that just the same way we came out or is there a different door?
Dungeon Master 02:01:14 courtyard that's got like certain gravestones of important figures, but it's mostly just like flowers and it's nicely maintained so it's like people can walk the courtyard of the chapel. But you make your way through it, you know, weaving through people when necessary. There are some people hanging their heads, maybe a little Solomon of the Lawson family member, some people just chatting and having a walk in this beautiful area. But eventually you get to like the back of, we'll say like the property, and you do see like
Dungeon Master 02:01:44 A little bit sunken down, not quite as tall and grand as the rest of everything. A basic wooden door that goes into like a stone building that is like the, just like the area below the ground that goes into and it's got all of the, what's the word I'm looking, like mausoleum almost.
Kaladin Shash 02:02:06 Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:02:09 But as you approach, you do see that there are, in fact, like, two people who seem to be, like, working the grounds back here. One of them is a larger, thicker, almost orcish figure in appearance, kind of a big, like, underbite, just sort of tusks, lower teeth sort of poking out a little bit, but, you know, just doing the work, shoveling some stuff, transferring it to, like, a pile in the wheelbarrow from the ground.
Dungeon Master 02:02:38 And the other one is like a more like, I will use the term like devilishly handsome in that their base origin is like tiefling. They're just, there's something very charming in their appearance. And they just seem to be like trimming up some rose bushes as they've got like a front apron on and they've got like the shears in it, both male figures. And they just like are having pleasant conversations as you walk up.
Kaladin Shash 02:02:49 Hello.
Dungeon Master 02:03:04 And the more orcish one goes, good day. Good day. The other one, the more tiefling-esque one, spins around, very intrigued, and it goes,
Kaladin Shash 02:03:17 We need to get into the mausoleum. Yes, we do. And we have the blessings of Kolor to enter.
Dungeon Master 02:03:32 And do you have official business in the mausoleum? I was just getting to that. I was just seeing if you were actually allowed to be here. Absolutely. And then as this conversation goes on, Zario, go ahead and give me a perception check.
Zariel Torgan 02:04:01 All right. Nine. There you go.
Kaladin Shash 02:04:06 Somebody noticed something. Okay, okay, okay.
Dungeon Master 02:04:10 Nine. Everybody give me a perception check. Sorry, I don't really notice anything. 18.
Leopold Magnus 02:04:21 We're getting a little better than nine, but not much. There we go.
Dungeon Master 02:04:29 Callan, you're chatting, and you see very distinctly this more tiefling-esque person notices at your belt this symbol as he's chatting with you, very pleasantly and everything. And Zario, you don't notice it at all. And Leopold, you notice it a second too late. But Callan, as you're sort of having this conversation, there are people sort of like you hear the gate to the courtyard closes, just like the click of the gate.
Dungeon Master 02:04:58 as it like latches and you see there like three or four people walking in slowly pacing towards you at the other end of the corridor you see like four or more so people sort of like slowly walking in as you're having this conversation and this uh more tiefling-esque figure just goes uh i will let you in but i have to ask do you prefer justice or do you prefer wrath
Zariel Torgan 02:05:29 Ooh. I. OK, never mind. Oh, I know I was just going to. I don't know if it was too late, but I was hoping to see if I could do some sort of like insight.
Kaladin Shash 02:05:35 I hope that doesn't change the interaction that we're going to have. But for justice, what do you want to wear? Do you want a giraffe?
Zariel Torgan 02:05:56 As they're giving the options if there's one that they're clearly preferring Well, I was just gonna I was just gonna blurt it out if Because he said hmm I was thinking if I had a chance, but if not, it's totally fine Well, he said justice if we want to go with that then i'm cool
Dungeon Master 02:06:02 I'm gonna say that this is all happening real time, and since Kaladin was doing the talking, you wouldn't have, like, a moment to be like, I think you should pick this one. Like, he's just gonna... he's gonna... Uh, Giphy...
Zariel Torgan 02:06:27 All right, just say wrath or justice, would you? Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm.
Kaladin Shash 02:06:31 I said justice, but that's I could have been mine just individually.
Dungeon Master 02:06:32 Give me an insight check. I'm going to say it's a pretty high DT to connect to something that's already happened. And it's not going to change that Calvin said something, but he's going to say justice no matter what. But this is like whether or not you get a different answer out at the same time. 15.
Zariel Torgan 02:06:59 Yeah. I do. That's a 19.
Dungeon Master 02:07:01 Go ahead. Do you want to like bless yourself or guide yourself on that? 19. It was a weird offhand comment that Leopold made in the bar last night.
Kaladin Shash 02:07:15 Yes. I did.
Dungeon Master 02:07:25 where he just very, very obviously blurted out something about how he bets all of these people worship Teo, the god of wrath. And it was just sort of like, ha ha, that's weird. Nothing founds on that. And then you get to ask this very specific question. And I think because the insight wasn't amazing, and it didn't beat the check that I had in my head, but it was really close, so I gave you something. I'm going to say, you don't get off
Zariel Torgan 02:07:36 Mmhmm.
Dungeon Master 02:07:54 an answer quick enough that it's like, oh, he's looking for this. But you do hear Kaladin say, justice. And in your head, you're like, that sounds wrong. But then as this happens, because again, all happening at the same time,
Dungeon Master 02:08:08 Steven just goes, for the father, I will let you into the grounds, no problem, as promised. And you see he turns the key in the lock, turns it to the right, opens the door. You hear like the creak and the silence and the dust settles of like the dark catacombs below. And as you guys are sort of monitoring the situation, you see that all the people that were sort of walking towards you are dispersing, not like paying you specific mind, like, like,
Dungeon Master 02:08:37 weird horror movie type moment where they were all approaching you and then you look back up and they're just sort of all doing their own thing, looking away, talking with each other as if they were never walking towards you. Instantaneous. But you guys have entrance into this place.
Leopold Magnus 02:08:58 What I clocked at that it was wrath because I had picked up on it in the bar. I don't think I did like a perception check here, or maybe I was that for this engagement? Yeah, it must have been.
Dungeon Master 02:09:07 You had... You never did an insight check. That's because you hadn't rolled enough earlier. I will say, like, if you, the player, tell me that your character would not have dropped that idea, you could also have put it together, but it won't change the fact that Kaladin did say the wrong
Dungeon Master 02:09:35 thing as far as you would know like if you believe the answer is wrath he said justice and you guys aren't going to change that by backtracking things but I will let you be like oh we have hold also knows that's probably the wrong answer.
Leopold Magnus 02:09:50 OK, yeah, that's all I was looking for.
Zariel Torgan 02:09:51 So he's opened up the catacombs and let us, like just said, go for it, like letting us go down?
Dungeon Master 02:09:58 Yep, opens the door, gives you a light, polite bow, goes back to trimming, like, his little rose hedge that he's got. The other guy, the more brutish sort of orc figure, goes back and just, like, looks like he's maybe digging a grave, like he is digging dirt out of the ground and putting it into a wheelbarrow.
Zariel Torgan 02:10:22 Could I wait to see if Kaladin is going to start walking down? And if he is, can I just take a beat and approach this guy? I don't know. I don't want to go out of order.
Kaladin Shash 02:10:46 I mean, all I did was unlock it. Um, would I have clocked that as he used the key? There would have been an option to turn it or engage at the lock a different way than he did. Yes, I did.
Dungeon Master 02:10:47 That'd be a great question for Cal. Give me an intelligence check.
Zariel Torgan 02:11:06 Good question. Nice. Natural 20.
Dungeon Master 02:11:16 That girl went to absolutely, you needed this. Kaladin, you were the most keen on the sort of like the weird tension in the air. He sticks this key in the lock and you see it absolutely looks like it has the ability to turn both ways. But furthermore, with sort of like your inherent arcane eye, when he turns the key right, you see there's like a flash of magic.
Kaladin Shash 02:11:27 Thank you.
Dungeon Master 02:11:44 and then the door opens but it's very subtle and it's only because you got a nat 20 on the key mechanism specifically like a very well-placed question as a player that you even catch this at all um you think that like if the door were closed and you turn the key left a different effect might happen and something else could be like changed you don't know what necessarily this is all again you know bullet time everything's happening right after each other
Dungeon Master 02:12:15 Yep, you've got the two sort of groundskeepers right at the entrance of the place. And then there's like the, you know, 15 or so people who are just sort of like randomly walking around the courtyard.
Kaladin Shash 02:12:15 That's perfect. Has that has the devil? You said the devilishly handsome guys already went back to tending his bush, right? Yeah. That's right, there's like a bazillion of those baddies. I think I would whisper to Zario.
Kaladin Shash 02:12:44 We need to speak to him again. There's an opportunity, it's the door, a different way.
Zariel Torgan 02:12:48 I'll just, I'll give a nod and I'll approach, I'll try to approach the guy that we just spoke to in a casual yet
Zariel Torgan 02:13:09 meaningful way. I'm trying to make it not seem super obvious, but I'm trying to let him know that I would like to speak to him if he would turn and give the opportunity to do so. Interesting.
Dungeon Master 02:13:22 Uh, you notice that he doesn't.
Leopold Magnus 02:13:31 Still.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:34 I'll say, uh, I'll just say like, kind of just in the air, I'll just say, uh, well, maybe Cedric sent us to the wrong place and here I thought we were going to be able to make some real change happen. And I'll just kind of take a step away.
Kaladin Shash 02:13:57 From the doorway.
Zariel Torgan 02:13:59 Just away from the guy. Like I went to talk to the guy and he didn't want to talk. I just want to throw that out there and see if he does anything with it. They're both just as bad. I'll do persuasion because
Dungeon Master 02:14:09 Give me persuasion or deception, depending on how you're trying to sort of catch his attention. It might be the same check for you, but yeah, you might have been proficient in one. It is the truth.
Zariel Torgan 02:14:29 I it is the truth. Is it too late to guide myself? Do I lift this guidance? Do I need to start like following a specific rule that way it's not just going to an annoying thing? Hmm.
Dungeon Master 02:14:42 I mean, it's always an annoying thing to add on a check afterwards. But it is also important to keep in mind that guidance is touch and it is a spell. So for you to be like, Oh, this Cedric guy sent us but on place you touch yourself and there is like a radiant of energy that flows into your body when you do it if you're going to use a spell on you. It's just worth keeping in mind that it's not like
Zariel Torgan 02:15:04 Yeah. Yeah. People are going to notice if I touch myself. Yeah. OK. All right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, OK.
Dungeon Master 02:15:08 a bardic inspiration which is just like a reassuring touch or something like that it's like an actual spell there there is something to it however quick right or if you're like you know walk up and touch somebody on the shoulder right as they do something in conversation that's very obvious action
Zariel Torgan 02:15:30 All right, deception. No, persuasion. All right, here we go. Minus one. Nine. Not good.
Leopold Magnus 02:15:47 So he's taking us just into the catacombs, essentially. Got it.
Dungeon Master 02:15:51 He's not taking you, he's opened the door for you to explore it. Zario, this is almost painfully difficult for you because you do notice when you say Cedric's name and you say that phrase, he catches his attention. You almost had it, but if this were the equivalent of a speakeasy, you gave the wrong password at the door and they're not going to let you in just because you changed your answer, right?
Dungeon Master 02:16:21 Like, even though the, you know, you guys aren't obviously cops right now or whatever, legionnaire, equivalent of law enforcement as like your job, you're, you sort of obfuscated that you still sort of like said the wrong thing to the guy at the door. And so you were saying good things afterwards, but like, just not quite there. You're going to have to find a different way.
Dungeon Master 02:16:47 So you say Cedric's name, he sort of perks up, but he doesn't turn to you to do more with it. Yeah, like he is a groundskeeper for this chapel and the like the high cleric of the church said that you could look around the grounds. So he has opened the door for you to look on the grounds, but
Leopold Magnus 02:16:55 So he opens the door and then just kind of heads on doing. Right.
Zariel Torgan 02:16:56 Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:17:14 There's obviously more going on, but to address it would be like outright blowing your cover, and it might be very dangerous for you to do that.
Leopold Magnus 02:17:32 Does anybody have a high dexterity? I'm just wondering, is there a chance we could distract him and snipe that key off his belt? Yeah, maybe you could get some guidance and I could maybe try and distract him so he's not paying as close attention.
Zariel Torgan 02:17:32 What do you guys think? Do you want to just? Not me. I was thinking that.
Kaladin Shash 02:17:40 That's a pretty good dex. Oh, my sleight of hand's not fantastic, but we could try. It's not bad, but it's not proficient.
Zariel Torgan 02:18:02 Heck, you know guys, all we gotta do is bring a dude back alive. Why don't we just merc this dude? Yeah, let's just... Let's just, uh...
Kaladin Shash 02:18:09 I know. I honestly honestly when. We we missed the get in. I was like, alright, well, at least we know we've got the spot and then you mentioned that like we could. Well, there's like 15. There's like 15 people in the courtyard.
Leopold Magnus 02:18:23 I could charm him. Yeah, I could charm him, and then he would be on our side, and then maybe he could take us in, and it would be a little bit more undercover. OK. Yeah, so as he's walking away,
Zariel Torgan 02:18:27 Yeah, yeah, why don't we just try to get him out of sight and then just, you know, yoink him. Oh shit, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:18:42 Give it a run, give it a run.
Leopold Magnus 02:18:51 I think what I'll do is, is there any bushes nearby? What's kind of the route he's taking?
Dungeon Master 02:19:00 the
Dungeon Master 02:19:17 And you guys had sort of interrupted his task, and he sort of responded to you, opened the door for you, and then he went back to doing that, and he is very obviously ignoring you now, but he's not, like, walking away. So he's just standing there. Just, yeah, just working on the bushes.
Leopold Magnus 02:19:30 He's working on the bushes. OK. Yeah, OK, so what I'm going to what I'm going to do is I'm going to use one of my magical tinkering abilities and I am going to
Leopold Magnus 02:19:50 put in a message that's playing and I'm going to tuck it kind of behind in the bushes. I'm going to try to sneak back there and kind of plant it or maybe just toss it in there. So the sound sounds like it's coming from the bush.
Dungeon Master 02:20:05 And then I need a pretty good stealth check just because, again, this is broad daylight in an open courtyard. And there are like, I mean, they're pretending not to notice you now, but like at least 15 people who were walking towards you at one point. So you'd have to get a pretty good sleight of hand sort of stealth to not be noticed doing this.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:27 Okay, there's no way I can grab a rock and tuck behind a corner or something like that. Okay. What about if I just went down in the catacombs, are there people down there?
Dungeon Master 02:20:33 It's not like a heavily forested area. You can't just like bob out of view out of nowhere. It doesn't seem to be like when he opened the door it seemed pretty like hollow sounding and empty. That much you know for sure.
Leopold Magnus 02:20:57 OK, yeah, maybe I'll talk in the catacombs and pick up a small rock and imbue it with a little message. And then I'll just try and subtly toss it in the bush, kind of back up the bush and toss it. Maybe that'll make it a little easier to hide the fact that I've done that.
Dungeon Master 02:21:15 Okay, do we want to do a loose initiative or a normal initiative for this as you guys sort of like Leopold walks into the sort of mausoleum at one point what are you guys doing during after before.
Zariel Torgan 02:21:29 So, I don't know that he's doing anything. My shot missed, his missed. I'm just kinda looking after Kellen Oak to see, you know, he knows that my second attempt didn't work. I'm just gonna see Leo walk down towards the mausoleum, I'll just start heading down too.
Kaladin Shash 02:21:30 I think I would stand at the top of the stairs and see. If this does not work, we grab him.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:00 Oh shit. Yeah. Sounds good to me.
Leopold Magnus 02:22:06 I guess a first order of business is how big is this bush? Is this something that I could pull him into and be obfuscated or is that not going to happen either? Oh, OK, OK, I kind of imagined it a big hedge that maybe I could duck him into a hedge. OK.
Dungeon Master 02:22:16 It's like a rose bush and like it's not that huge. There are some brown. Once I get you guys to the map, we'll get and we can base stuff a little bit more about that, but nothing like right next to the entrance of this building.
Kaladin Shash 02:22:21 You got it.
Leopold Magnus 02:22:41 Well, that's what I'm targeting, is a bush that Mike catches attention. And I'm going to put my magical tinkering item inside it, kind of deep inside the bush. Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Dungeon Master 02:22:50 Okay. And let's get some people in here, shall we? I'm just going to throw in a bunch of placement things. I didn't know this was going to happen this way. Continue to make your plan though. Don't let me.
Zariel Torgan 02:22:53 You know, put your magical tinkering at him deep in the bush.
Kaladin Shash 02:22:58 Keep this.
Leopold Magnus 02:23:18 Yep. Okay. So once I cast that, I'm gonna, I'm gonna put my magical item in the bush and it'll just play six seconds of what sounds like very steamy sex. Yeah. So I'm, I'm down there tinkering and, and you're just hearing a very light
Zariel Torgan 02:23:31 What is happening?
Kaladin Shash 02:23:31 I was going to say, you had to make the noise that you recorded, correct? Top of the stairs, I'm so confused. You know, that's what Zaria likes, okay.
Dungeon Master 02:23:41 It's from the bottom of the mouth.
Leopold Magnus 02:23:59 but I'll come back and my bandages will be all disheveled a little bit.
Kaladin Shash 02:24:03 Okay, so you guys, I'm going to try to, we're going to try to distract him, I'm trying to pickpocket him, or you're going to try to charm him first.
Zariel Torgan 02:24:10 That's a different burning sensation. I think we gotta try to charm him before, because if we yank him into a bush, all bets are off.
Dungeon Master 02:24:11 That's cool.
Leopold Magnus 02:24:20 I'm going to try and get him to look into that bush to investigate it, maybe. And then we can pull him in. I'll charm him really quick and push him out of the bush.
Kaladin Shash 02:24:34 Charm him before anything. Yeah, it's over. Right, charm him first and then tell him that you want entrance into Teo's temple. You can't be in the bush, it's a rose bush, man. Oh, the hedge, hedge. That's right, okay.
Leopold Magnus 02:24:47 OK, yeah, I guess if he comes close enough and I'll be inside the bush, I'll be able to charm him without. Yeah, exposing the fact that I've done that. No, no, Jonathan said there is some bigger. There is a bigger hedge.
Dungeon Master 02:25:04 There are some hackers, yeah. You guys on the map now? Okay, these are not all the same people, but I just had to get like 15 of people. Yeah, so you could have been like in the bottom of the mausoleum type deal, done your message, sort of popped back up, and when like, I don't know, somebody body blocked, you just sort of tossed it back for a second.
Kaladin Shash 02:25:06 Here we go. Yeah, awesome. Great.
Leopold Magnus 02:25:18 Yeah, so maybe up here around the corner, I don't know if this map is. And then I'll go around this side of the building and try to subtly get into the bush.
Dungeon Master 02:25:43 I mean, are you hiding the fact that you were walking around the building? Okay, go ahead and give me a stealth check.
Leopold Magnus 02:25:48 Yeah, I mean, I guess what I'm trying to do is very subtly just kind of patrol the grounds. And then, yeah, right here, look back and maybe try to dip behind the building when nobody's looking.
Dungeon Master 02:26:06 I'm going to give you disadvantage if you don't already have it, because you are out in the open and you obviously, I think it's like very strenuous. People are watching you. You know, sixes could have been worse. You don't know how successfully you slipped away or how many people, but you definitely like take some time, maybe like making fake observations, picking up some fake stuff as part of like the investigation, and then you sort of slip behind here.
Kaladin Shash 02:26:20 Mm-hmm.
Leopold Magnus 02:26:38 Cool. Yeah, then I'll try to hide there and wait to see if the guy with the key comes to investigate. Because he's within earshot of that, I would imagine.
Dungeon Master 02:26:50 Mhm. You guys just waiting at the front then?
Kaladin Shash 02:27:04 Yeah, I just stepped to the side of the entrance, just waiting.
Zariel Torgan 02:27:04 I'm just waiting to see if that charm works or whatever he's got going on. I assume he's got a plan.
Dungeon Master 02:27:17 So, a beat passes, you guys are standing next to the door, not really going in after this point. Leopold has disappeared around the back, and then you guys start hearing some, like, raunchy, overacted sort of sex sounds from, like, the bush. And everybody sort of, like, looks up at the origin of it. It's just like, what's going on over there? Do you guys do anything? Do you pretend like you don't know it? Do you act like you don't?
Kaladin Shash 02:27:46 You're the groundskeeper, aren't you? You're the groundskeeper. Go check out that bush, groundskeeper.
Dungeon Master 02:27:47 Don't understand what's going on. You guys are in such a deep fucking hole.
Zariel Torgan 02:27:47 Hmm. Oh, strange sound. You better check it out. Yeah, that's your job, man. I mean, I don't know much about much, but sure. Amy.
Dungeon Master 02:28:20 this uh tiefling figure looks up at you like drags their hand down their face just like uh what what is what is all this going on here are we playing a game is this fun for you he looks the other guy he goes uh haggard come
Kaladin Shash 02:28:31 you.
Zariel Torgan 02:28:40 I surely don't know what you mean.
Dungeon Master 02:28:48 Come with me, let's go check this out. And you see the Tiefling figure and the Orcus figure sort of like push past you, a little bit fed up with the fact that you guys are still here. Like, you both know what's sort of going on, but this is just sort of who plays chicken kind of deal, who breaks first. And they're sort of just like, you're really not giving up yet. And they're walking around the corner to the back, out of view from, I'll say, like, more than half of the people.
Zariel Torgan 02:29:23 I am gonna try to sneak back there as well, behind them. Alright. 13.
Dungeon Master 02:29:30 You can still check with disadvantage. We'll do just their active checks. The tiefling gets a plus three and the orcish figure gets a plus one.
Dungeon Master 02:30:00 on their perception. Kiefling does not notice you. And the orchestra does not notice you. You are successfully sneaking. Yep.
Kaladin Shash 02:30:17 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 02:30:21 So have they approached the bush yet? Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:30:28 There, they're walking up. I mean, like, your stealth check was bad, like, there's like, again, like I said, there's this very awkward weird game of chicken where like, they kind of know that you're back here making noise, but this is just sort of like you're exchanging weird formalities and politeness until they're hoping you just leave.
Dungeon Master 02:30:51 And so, like, you're going back there and you see them walking up. They don't, like, investigate the bush. They, like, walk back there together. They stand a couple feet away, not to get too close, and they're just looking in, like, seeing if they can spot you, because you're the only member not fully present they could see. But you don't know if they see you necessarily. You are tucked in there pretty deep. You see from the other direction as, like, they're looking at you. You do see Zariel sneaking up behind them, and they don't seem to have noticed him.
Leopold Magnus 02:31:21 Okay, and if I were to cast a spell on this bush, would that draw attention to anyone else besides the two in front of me? Okay. So yeah, as they approach the bush, I'm gonna kind of peek out so I can, you know, cast a spell, and I'm gonna use Charm Person at the second level, which should allow me to charm both of them.
Dungeon Master 02:31:29 No, probably just the two of them. OK. The charisma saving through correct.
Leopold Magnus 02:31:54 It's a wisdom saving throw DC 14. Yeah, it's kind of cool. Yeah, I clicked on it and so that's what came up.
Dungeon Master 02:32:02 Gotcha, gotcha. Oh, that is cool. Yeah, let me get their sheets to pull it up.
Kaladin Shash 02:32:04 I'll put the saving through in the little chat.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:08 That's kinda cool.
Dungeon Master 02:32:35 OK, I can't find it. I'm going to say just being general practitioners of arcane wisdom is going to be a better step, but not great, so I'll just give them a plus 2. If it was charisma, maybe. This will be, we'll just keep going the same order, tiefling first.
Zariel Torgan 02:32:37 It's all right. You can just say that. You can just see that they failed at school. Minus two would be fine, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:32:40 Yeah, that's fine. Well, that's what we want.
Leopold Magnus 02:32:43 Oh.
Dungeon Master 02:33:05 Natural two. And the orc does succeed. So you've seen term one, you see he goes from being like really annoyed to like, he gets a little more playful look in his eyes. And he seems to find a little bit more funny, but the guy on his right does not seem to think it's funny.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:07 Jesus.
Leopold Magnus 02:33:14 Okay. Yeah. So after that takes effect on the T-plane, I'll say, um, dear sir, do me a favor and grab that gentleman and bring him in here.
Zariel Torgan 02:33:36 Oh, shit. Wait. Damn it. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:33:43 Do you mind reading Charm Person for me?
Leopold Magnus 02:33:48 Yeah. Tip to Charmy Humanoid. You can see within range. Mace of Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. Charmed creature regards you as friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.
Dungeon Master 02:34:10 Okay, so he'll know he's trying at the end. He doesn't necessarily consider his friend an enemy. He just doesn't consider you an enemy. You are currently an ally. So he goes just straight up. He just goes, No, I'm not. Not gonna do that to him. What are you doing back there? That's you're being so playful.
Leopold Magnus 02:34:35 Okay, so charm person doesn't necessarily allow you to control them like Got it, okay Then yeah, I'll kind of pop out of the bush and I'll say oh dear sometimes these rusty gears get a little stiff if you know what I mean, and I have to stretch it out before I drop a load and
Dungeon Master 02:34:40 You will not be controlling them. That'll be dominate person or dominate monster, which is a stronger spell.
Dungeon Master 02:35:05 Okay, I've had enough of this and you see the other guy grabs his shovel and he's going to hit you in the head. Everybody go ahead and roll me initiative.
Zariel Torgan 02:35:13 Ah, shit.
Kaladin Shash 02:35:15 One board so on paper all. No, he's not.
Leopold Magnus 02:35:34 Wait, so this other guy, is he defending us or is he just standing by letting this happen? He doesn't have anything to say, like in regards to his friend hitting us with a shovel. Got it.
Dungeon Master 02:35:39 He's not currently a Greta. Well, he will. He'll go first, so he will voice his stuff, but he's not. He's like weirdly neutral in this.
Dungeon Master 02:35:58 uh so first up is going to be we've got uh you didn't know his name but his name is zander and he goes uh hagar no uh what okay he was slightly spanish i think it was and he goes i i don't don't you don't do that what are you doing as he sort of he's gonna hold his action um no i mean he you do see him he does see you as a friend he's gonna try to intervene and sort of stand between you and this other figure he's come on he's just playing
Dungeon Master 02:36:28 That'll be his turn. Up next will be Zariel.
Zariel Torgan 02:36:34 What do you say, boys? Can we take out this, like, group of 60 people that are all here? I mean... I mean, what? Yeah, I mean, I don't think we have a lot of options. You said grab him, so, I mean...
Kaladin Shash 02:36:43 just depends if they're all little peons maybe if they're all level right if they're all level three so like we're we're not in a bush we're not hidden some of some someone's going to watch this interaction to occur i whispered to you said if this doesn't work we'll grab him we just he's
Leopold Magnus 02:36:44 I think it's best if we can avoid it, but I I didn't realize the term person was was
Leopold Magnus 02:37:11 different. I thought maybe he would be compelled to help us. But yeah, now understanding that I wouldn't. Right, right, right. Yeah, no, I understand that now. But I think initially, that's kind of what I was thinking. But so I tried to play it off because I was just in there, you know, taking a big job or something weird.
Kaladin Shash 02:37:14 No, if you would have gotten the two charmed, yeah, the two.
Dungeon Master 02:37:15 He considers you a friend. He's willing to offer you information. He's willing to do things for you that he otherwise wouldn't, but he doesn't, like he's not under your control.
Zariel Torgan 02:37:27 No, no, it's... Yeah. I was... Yeah. Yeah. No, it's cool. I was just thinking... We could be like, hey, let's go get a sandwich. Uh, but he already hit you, so... Let's, uh... Oh, I thought... I thought he... Oh. Um...
Dungeon Master 02:37:47 Nobody said anybody yet. This has not resulted in violence yet. No, he's going to hit him. This guy is very much done with this whole interaction because he knows you tried to cast a spell on him. His friend is now acting weird. You tried to lie. You were hiding in the bushes. None of this makes sense, and they're done being polite about it, or at least he is.
Kaladin Shash 02:37:55 He's just he's raising the shovel into it.
Dungeon Master 02:38:15 But this hasn't actually resulted in violence.
Zariel Torgan 02:38:20 I don't know, what do you say, gang? Wanna get freaky? All right. Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna come around here
Leopold Magnus 02:38:26 I feel like we should try to at least exhaust our chances of getting this kind of taken care of because we got one guy charmed and he's the one with the key.
Kaladin Shash 02:38:27 And I. I'm coming up. Right? Right, so you should ask him for the key. I'll hold an action because you're at the bottom of the order.
Zariel Torgan 02:38:49 And I'm going to interpose myself between the two of these guys. And I'm going to say, well, I'm real sorry, friend. My buddy Leo here, he gets real excited when he meets new people. It's it's not his fault. And I just grab Leo and try to, like, act like everything's cool and he doesn't have to escalate like I'm taking charge of the situation and I'm going to get him out of here. I will be on our way. I apologize.
Dungeon Master 02:39:11 You know I'm going to ask for a deception with disadvantage, but the whole theatrics of pushing him away, I'll make it straight. Not bad. Hold on. On a natural six that I just rolled physical dice.
Zariel Torgan 02:39:25 All right, deception. That is a 16.
Kaladin Shash 02:39:31 It's not fair.
Leopold Magnus 02:39:32 Pretty good or minus one.
Dungeon Master 02:39:40 He doesn't sort of see past it. He goes, he's got the shovel up and he just sort of lets that up. I just, you guys get out of here. Tired of dealing with your nuisance.
Zariel Torgan 02:39:54 I'm real sorry. Real sorry. Yeah, we'll move on right now and I'll just start bringing Leo slowly and circuitously around so that he can interact with that guy if he wants to, or maybe we give it like a beat and then try to talk to him in a second or what, I don't know. Anyway, my turn is done.
Dungeon Master 02:40:19 OK, I will go loose initiative. Callum, you can do something if you want. Otherwise we'll go to Leo and Zander.
Kaladin Shash 02:40:27 Uh, I'm just gonna cast bless. I just kind of. Just wait. Hoping that we can get. Uhm, he only views. Strong person just means that right now Leo pulled his viewed as a friendly. Correct?
Zariel Torgan 02:40:32 Ace.
Dungeon Master 02:40:52 Yeah, Leopold is going to be the only in on this because he's the only one that they, like, remotely trust, and that's only for however long the spell lasts. And only between them two.
Kaladin Shash 02:41:00 That's fine tonight, then I'm going to go ahead and. I'm going to go ahead and maneuver myself closer to the guy that has the key so that whenever. Do you pull begins to interact with him? Can I hold an action to try to? To pickpocket him. You can. I know if it doesn't work, I'm gonna. That's what I'm gonna use my action at the bottom of the turn.
Leopold Magnus 02:41:18 I think we could just ask him to let us in, or at least I can, because he's charmed. Yeah. Oh, I see.
Kaladin Shash 02:41:31 Maybe we can swipe the key and then come back later.
Dungeon Master 02:41:32 OK. Moving back to the two that Leopoldos, this will be just your chance to talk back and forth with Xander. So what do you say sort of as it hits your turn?
Leopold Magnus 02:41:44 Oh dear, oh dear, I do apologize. Like, like Zariel said here, I get carried away. Sorry. And then I'll try to turn to the tiefling and just kind of subtly say, well, may I have a word with you in a bit? It's one more thing I'd like to discuss.
Dungeon Master 02:42:04 No. No, of course. I feel bad. I feel like maybe we got off on the wrong foot. Yeah, please. Let's take a walk. And how long do you have on this spell? Just so I know, timeline-wise, how fast are you going to work? An hour? OK, cool. So not super stressed on it. He starts walking and chatting with you. What do you want to talk about?
Leopold Magnus 02:42:19 It's an hour. Yeah. Well, as you see, my friend here, he prefers justice, but I myself find the wrath more interesting. And I don't think we ever got a chance to discuss it, but I would really love to meet like-minded people.
Zariel Torgan 02:42:21 Jesus Christ.
Kaladin Shash 02:42:28 you
Dungeon Master 02:42:50 See, Sparks had, again, a devilish grin across his face. He goes, you know, I thought it was odd that he mentioned Cedric and everything. And then, you guys, you're just really sorry about that. But you got the password wrong. There's no letting you in. But if you do mean it, you are a follower of RAP.
Leopold Magnus 02:43:13 Oh, indeed, and I show my talisman. In fact, I think that we could help out the organization quite a bit.
Dungeon Master 02:43:20 Let me help you. I like what you've got going on. I believe that you are cool. Absolutely, through and through, there's something about you that I trust. But you're friends, and then I'm going to need you to go ahead, and this will be like the last check on this. You do God bless.
Dungeon Master 02:43:48 He goes, how do I know I can trust your friends? And go ahead and give me persuasion or deception.
Leopold Magnus 02:44:00 Okay. Well, you see, they aren't quite fully bought in, but I'm convinced that they will be critical to the cause and that I can really lead them to true wrath. In fact, I think he is quite moldable towards our vision of the world. So maybe we just give him one chance. Oh, for fuck's sake.
Dungeon Master 02:44:26 1.
Leopold Magnus 02:44:32 Dude, that was on an actual 20 and then it just rolled over. Yeah, I guess I'll just throw that bless on there for shits and giggles to make it eight.
Zariel Torgan 02:44:46 Just go without us, man.
Dungeon Master 02:44:57 Um, I think you get advantage on charisma-based chicks against people who are charmed by you, or is that not a thing? Yeah, he's in. Yeah, this is whether or not Xander lets you two in as well.
Leopold Magnus 02:45:06 Oh, let me double check. Yeah, it doesn't specifically say anything. It just says regards
Zariel Torgan 02:45:11 I thought that you just automatically got what you wanted if it was like something friendly. But I think it has to do with him.
Dungeon Master 02:45:30 I'm just going to give you advantage anyway because I want you to get more than an 8. You guys are trying really hard at this. It's a lot of wasted effort otherwise. So it's a 12 plus 4. You already rolled a d4. You got that 4. 16.
Leopold Magnus 02:45:35 Okay, hopefully. Yeah, we'll see. Yeah, how about a 12 still not very good. Oh, yeah, we're gonna keep the old one. Yeah, I guess. Okay. So, yeah, like 16.
Kaladin Shash 02:45:47 16.
Dungeon Master 02:45:57 um he looks past he sort of bites his lip and sort of like sucks in through it just you know like light sucking status how about this i don't trust your friends gonna be honest it's being you against the world right uh and your name is by the way
Leopold Magnus 02:46:21 Oh, me? Frederick, Fred for short.
Zariel Torgan 02:46:21 Ah shit.
Dungeon Master 02:46:25 Frederick Fred, for short. I knew I could trust a name like that. I will grant you audience, but... And here's what I'll say. Obviously, you guys are a team of some sort. Friends for life, whatever you guys are doing, wandering around. I cannot let them in or it'll be my ass. And I do mean this literally, they will kill me. You are cool to come in.
Dungeon Master 02:46:56 And whatever this turns into, I don't give a fuck if you work with them on whatever it happens. Sorry, it makes more sense if I can explain it all. Does this sound fine for you so far, though? Mikey.
Leopold Magnus 02:47:14 Well, I tell you what, kind sir, how about we try this one more time? How about you give me that key? Yes, I'd love to. I'd love to take a look at that. Looks quite nice. Well, yes, and then borrow it for, you know, maybe a short period of time. Of course, yes, of course.
Dungeon Master 02:47:30 They're just going to look at it. But they will get it back. So you don't want in our group. Oh, I mean, we just. OK, well, then how do you know about Cedric and Rath if you don't want in?
Zariel Torgan 02:47:37 Hmm.
Leopold Magnus 02:47:50 What? No, no, no, of course not. I just want to take a look at that key. Well, I did, but now I really am interested in this key. To be honest with you, I like the look of that thing.
Dungeon Master 02:48:06 Uh, okay, sure. Holds out the key.
Zariel Torgan 02:48:07 It's complete 180. What?
Leopold Magnus 02:48:13 Alright, I'm gonna take that, I'm gonna look at it very slowly, carefully, and I'll say, May Wrath be with you! And walk over to my buds and I'll be like, guys, we gotta get out of here, they're lame. We got some duds on our hands, let's get out of here.
Kaladin Shash 02:48:33 We can leave. Can we come back later perhaps and try to go in and turn the key to the left? I think it was great. Yeah, we'll try again. Good. Yeah, let's let's make our way out while he's still charmed and you're the ones not doing anything to us.
Leopold Magnus 02:48:40 Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Try sneak sneak in here when they're when it's less busy now.
Zariel Torgan 02:48:52 I have a secondary pitch that is probably a little late now. Um, is he the only guy that lets people in and has a key? Cause we could have just waited till like a different dude was working and said the right answer, but it's cool. Let's, let's do this. And cause we already have charmed him. So.
Leopold Magnus 02:49:11 Really? Ah, which could potentially use the same key.
Kaladin Shash 02:49:13 Please.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:19 Anyway, but yeah, yeah, I'm on board. Let's do it. Let's let's roll out and come back in later. Shit. You know what?
Dungeon Master 02:49:25 unclear but the high cleric did tell you there were also some other chapels that might be like good locations to check out.
Kaladin Shash 02:49:43 What do you know?
Leopold Magnus 02:49:46 Yeah, let's bug out.
Zariel Torgan 02:49:49 Uh, by looking at the map, are we close enough to make it to another one of those and back within an hour? Okay. I was just thinking that, you know, if we really, yeah. What do you guys think?
Dungeon Master 02:49:58 Now within an hour, I would say like closest one is like you'd make it back right at an hour. But that's like walking distance there, walking distance back, no time in between. You guys didn't really check it out.
Kaladin Shash 02:50:13 He would have known he was charming. He'll see him now.
Leopold Magnus 02:50:16 So there's nothing in the mausoleum, right? We were down in there? Yeah. Okay. And so as I'm talking to him about the scale, I'll say, sir, there was one thing I made note of in this mausoleum, quite an interesting find. Would you mind taking a look with me about it? Okay. Yes, certainly. And I'll walk in there with him.
Zariel Torgan 02:50:22 We had another look, yeah.
Dungeon Master 02:50:37 And he goes, yeah, I don't mind showing you the mausoleum. You walk down the dusty steps, solid thuds on the concrete as you descend.
Leopold Magnus 02:50:47 And I'll just... Oh, hold on. I think I forgot something and I'll run back up to the entrance and I'll just lock the door behind me.
Kaladin Shash 02:50:49 I should. He's my other pitches. We need to leave. He's charmed. We can at least get him to walk out of here and then we can restrain him and take him all the way back to the court.
Dungeon Master 02:51:08 Thank you.
Leopold Magnus 02:51:15 Yeah, I was I was thinking we could at least isolate him in that shed but Yeah, yeah, okay
Zariel Torgan 02:51:16 yeah yeah my my thought was since you got his key from him shit let's just walk him back to the whole thing and then we've got a key to get in and a guy who's a member
Kaladin Shash 02:51:20 No, he'll just he'll just guide us out. Just ask him where the exit is and ask him if he'll guide you. We'll walk behind you.
Leopold Magnus 02:51:40 Yeah. That's a good idea. All right. Yeah. Let's, uh, I, as opposed to, uh, well, I'll take him down to the mausoleum and I'll point out a simple pile of bones and I'll ask him, don't you think those look interesting?
Dungeon Master 02:51:54 It's a really great thing that you didn't try to lock him down here. Cause he goes on. Yes. And the best part about this, this is all an illusion. This is a fake room for the people who aren't really on the level because you can't really see it from this way. But if you were on the other end of the magical barrier, you could see clearly through it. So we sort of monitor those who are pretending to look around here.
Zariel Torgan 02:52:09 Huh.
Leopold Magnus 02:52:10 Oh, oh. Oh, of course. Yes, oh, yes, yes, yes. Of course, I already knew that. Good sir, let's go.
Dungeon Master 02:52:22 So that's not the real pile of bones. Maybe that's why I look odd to you. You do have an eye for the arcane. All right. Where are we going? All right. Hi, guys. I'm picking up early for the day.
Leopold Magnus 02:52:38 Oh, well, I have something at home that I think would be worthwhile. No, probably all day.
Kaladin Shash 02:52:38 Silence.
Zariel Torgan 02:52:45 Go Napa.
Dungeon Master 02:52:49 Let the boss know that I'll be back. I don't know. How long do you think this will take? I'm taking a half day. I'll be back tomorrow. You guys are going to head back, I suppose? You're going to move quickly, yeah.
Kaladin Shash 02:53:10 Yeah, try to get them all the way to the core before the hour is over.
Zariel Torgan 02:53:14 Yeah, let's just hustle our bustle. Do you say survival? Do we want
Leopold Magnus 02:53:16 Is that a reasonable? We can, yeah. I think the Druid would have the best survival check.
Dungeon Master 02:53:20 you can but it'll be it'll be like he might be either losing it right before or um we'll make it the survival check how fast can you like bob and weave through the city to get him to the core before the spell wears off who wants to do it survival yeah getting through the city
Kaladin Shash 02:53:40 Survival. We'll we'll tie him up well. 3020 we're gonna get there.
Zariel Torgan 02:53:43 Okay, I'll roll it. I'll guide myself, too, since there's no reason not to. Oh, actually, I don't know if it's that kind of survival or not. I mean, it's that kind of check. Do we want to play a game like Tie Up Your Friend? Like, while we're doing that? That's a dirty 20. Okay.
Dungeon Master 02:53:51 Go for it. You are a legionnaire.
Kaladin Shash 02:54:07 I was gonna say, if we think we're not gonna make it, we just restrain him and drag him there and take our robes off, right? We're legionnaire.
Zariel Torgan 02:54:18 Yeah, it works for me.
Leopold Magnus 02:54:20 Yep, sounds good.
Dungeon Master 02:54:24 Cause you guys are sort of like rushing him back. Uh, you're making your way through the streets pretty quickly overall. Uh, a 20, a dirty 20 is great. Uh, I will say like it's getting close and Leopold, you're sort of holding the spell. You can feel its effect and when it's going to wear off and like you feel it starting to face, you guys go from like a walk to a fast walk to like a slow jog and then your feet are kind of bouncing.
Dungeon Master 02:54:52 And then eventually, like, you tear off your sort of robes and stuff to reveal that you are legionnaires and, like, you can feel the spell fading and you get him grappled as you guys are, like, walking up to the core and he starts fighting. He goes, I fucking knew it! You couldn't be trusted! You were my friend! Bits at you.
Zariel Torgan 02:55:11 off.
Kaladin Shash 02:55:11 Is it?
Leopold Magnus 02:55:13 uh, please, please, sir, please restrain yourself. This is completely unnecessary. And I'll, uh, I'll grapple on. Can we take them into the cell, like a jail cell at the core?
Dungeon Master 02:55:26 Yeah, I mean, you take them to like a holding spot and everything and easy enough to do you get them like checked in? Yeah, that's it's not too hard once you get them into like the center of military operations to get them into a cell. Do you guys do it all yourself? Do you like recruit some nearby soldiers to help you with it?
Kaladin Shash 02:55:49 Yeah, we wouldn't someone be in charge of like booking we. Tell him what squad was. Yeah, yeah, do that.
Dungeon Master 02:55:53 Yeah, I'm just asking are you guys doing it yourself or are you handing him off as somebody to take care of the rest? So yeah, we could play it out a little more aggressively that he's like fighting you worse and worse as he gets in as he sort of realizes he is now the weak point in whatever
Leopold Magnus 02:56:01 Oh, I think I'll, uh, maintain some custody there.
Dungeon Master 02:56:18 a bigger thing he's a part of. He's like fighting while he's carrying away. And he goes, you count your days. The reverend is coming for you and he'll make you pay. And he starts spitting venom at you. Verbally, not like actually venom. As he's fighting the whole time. But you pick up key things as in there is a figure called the reverend. As he just throws out. And this guy seems pretty confident that he's going to come for you because of this.
Leopold Magnus 02:56:49 Can I do an investigation check on his person to see if he has anything he could use to kill himself? Didn't we, did we see that before somebody killed themselves to prevent information getting out? Okay. Anyways. Yeah. Uh, and I was just maybe, maybe check his person for like some cyanide teeth or, you know, like any kind of weapons he could hurt himself with.
Kaladin Shash 02:57:02 No, I told them.
Zariel Torgan 02:57:03 Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Dungeon Master 02:57:13 You can check his person for weapons, yeah. Give him a pat down. Horton, you find that he's got a short sword underneath his robe strapped to his side. Take off that. He also has his own talisman with the same sort of
Leopold Magnus 02:57:19 Oh. 14. Yeah, I'm going to disarm him and I'll.
Dungeon Master 02:57:35 Slightly bent forward fingers of the outward facing palm sort of hidden under his vestment. You notice that he didn't have it out on display. So that might have been looking back. Maybe your first thing you did wrong was that you had these just openly displayed. So you instantly sort of were the odd ones out.
Leopold Magnus 02:57:56 Right. Okay, Pokemon holding cell. And then I'll turn to the group a little bit. Oh, so which one of you wants to be the good cop and which one of you wants to be the bad cop?
Zariel Torgan 02:58:14 Well, I'm not really much of the talking cop type. What I'd really like is to get our little free spinny thing, get a free token on the spinny thing. That's really what this has all been about.
Kaladin Shash 02:58:34 We can certainly question this guy. Do you want to be good or bad?
Leopold Magnus 02:58:37 Oh, well, I suppose we could go see Ratchet and get our spinny thing. What do you think, Kaladin? Oh, well, I'm not quite sure if I have the knack for being bad, but I've always wanted to give it a shot.
Kaladin Shash 02:59:03 You still have a better charisma than I do. You got to get that out. Okay.
Zariel Torgan 02:59:07 Yeah. It's definitely not going to be me, so... Uh, is Bless... Oh, Bless is faded. I'll do Guidance on the first, uh, whatever it is. I mean, the guy obviously is going to know, but it's at least something.
Leopold Magnus 02:59:23 Okay, so yeah, I'll walk him into the room and I will quickly place the duty maker in the chair he's about to be seated in. Please. I'm hoping to do it so he doesn't notice that it's been done.
Dungeon Master 02:59:34 Do you do it slyly, or do you just put something in his chair right before he sits down? Okay. Sits down, lets out the sound and the smell, then he goes, Mr. Chair, that, uh, what, huh? That was, that wasn't me, obviously.
Kaladin Shash 02:59:56 Well.
Leopold Magnus 03:00:01 Wait, do you think you could come into the core and shit your pants here in front of all of us? That was uncalled for. If you do, if you do that again, I will break your fingers in two. And I kind of turn over to Callan and I give a little like eyebrow raise.
Dungeon Master 03:00:07 What are you even talking about? That was obviously you! What? Now you heard somebody call in San Diego.
Zariel Torgan 03:00:09 Mm-hmm.
Kaladin Shash 03:00:23 Yes, yes, don't mind my colleague. Did we catch this guy's name, Xander? Is that what you said it was? OK.
Leopold Magnus 03:00:38 Now listen up, you're going to tell us everything you know about the symbol and its followers, and I start throwing them down on the ground. Or else, you're getting it, and I just punch the wall. Maybe splinter it a bit.
Kaladin Shash 03:00:54 Xander. I sit. I sit down. I sit down across. I'm imagining that we keep sitting at a small table, right? Like a regular interrogation. I sit across from him. Xander. Let's let's check. Would you like a cigarette?
Dungeon Master 03:00:54 He looks at you spitefully. I am but a piece in this puzzle. I have no weight in the floor. You can take me out. Your throats are empty.
Zariel Torgan 03:01:22 I'll run and get something for him. I come back with some salt water.
Dungeon Master 03:01:25 I don't smoke, it's against the teachings. A bit hard.
Kaladin Shash 03:01:30 That's fine, would you like something to drink? Excellent, whatever, please, please, give this guy something. And then you can do yourself a favor. Let's just talk about what you know.
Kaladin Shash 03:01:57 Perhaps your friends, like you said, won't kill you if you reappear after your half-day off. No one's wiser. Yes, very friendly, you took us to the exit. No one saw you after this.
Dungeon Master 03:02:09 I just, you can't give me any guarantee of this. I mean, I was seen leaving with you. I just, I don't. So I went with friends at one point. What's this deal with you?
Leopold Magnus 03:02:24 I've just pulled a pipe out of my bag, and I'm just kind of tapping it in my hands. Looking very intimidating. See the way I see it, chump, you have two choices. You can either take Kaladin's deal, or you can take the hard end of this pipe.
Zariel Torgan 03:02:32 I just beat him with a pipe.
Dungeon Master 03:02:47 Jesus, I don't mean to shit on your plan, but here's the way I see this, so hopefully you see this from me. Shut the fuck up. You want answers or not? If I tell you anything, I'm dead. If I don't tell you anything, they probably don't believe me and I'm dead. So what am I supposed to do here? What's my angle?
Leopold Magnus 03:02:56 No more talk about shit I heard and smelled what you did when we sat down. I suppose you'll have to live without kneecaps then.
Zariel Torgan 03:03:23 Hey there. Guys.
Leopold Magnus 03:03:25 Turn back to Cal it in like yeah, I'm really good. I'm really playing it up. He's really afraid right now. But can I can I offer him some kind of help?
Kaladin Shash 03:03:26 Xander. Xander, like you said, you're a dead man. We can help you. You just need to tell us some things.
Dungeon Master 03:03:29 Persuasion or deception check.
Leopold Magnus 03:03:55 considering I'm trying to... Yeah, I'll get him.
Dungeon Master 03:03:59 Yeah, you can do it as a branch.
Kaladin Shash 03:03:59 Is the guy. OK, so that's a that's advantage within D4. 19
Zariel Torgan 03:04:21 I've had...
Dungeon Master 03:04:28 Because I don't know that I can return. So if I tell you anything, I need to promise that I can get out of here. And he doesn't know if you're lying or not. But he rolled a natural four. He goes, well, I don't hate to be that guy for you guys, but Cedric,
Kaladin Shash 03:04:38 You have my word. Oh, yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:04:56 As far as I know it, he sends people to us. Normally people seek him out, so they already sort of know what to say, so that's where you guys really fucked up, because you said the wrong thing, but I think you've gathered that up at this point. The big kicker was... I just really opened the door. There's... There are a lot of us, though. I don't know that you know what you've gotten yourself into.
Dungeon Master 03:05:25 Especially now that you're publicly, as far as our organization goes, you are obviously not members. So whatever plan you have, I'd say fucking scratch it. It's bad. I've never met the boss.
Leopold Magnus 03:05:48 That's it. I slammed the pipe down. Gallatin, I think I'm going to kneecap this guy. He's holding out on us.
Kaladin Shash 03:05:59 Let him finish talking.
Dungeon Master 03:06:03 Jesus, calm down. Like I was just saying, I've never actually met the boss. They call him the reverence. What I do know that, you know, I guess you guys should be thankful almost of me that you took me and not somebody else. The chapel, it's deep underground. It's below the chapel of a Theodore.
Dungeon Master 03:06:32 You were at the right location. There's not a direct route necessarily, but we do have tunnels we've dug. No, I don't know that you guys know what you've gotten yourself into. There are hundreds of us. Most of them just come down the tunnel. We get to the food.
Kaladin Shash 03:06:43 Is there a better time of day to go? Perhaps when there's less people there? And leave them. They live there.
Dungeon Master 03:06:59 We get, yeah, the reverend feeds us. I don't need it because I stay out and I've got this public job that I work for Mateo instead. But I mean, all of the urchins and the poor folk and everybody in the city is turned to us because we take care of them. You walk in there unannounced and uninvited. I don't care how powerful you are. You're up against a million rats. You're dead.
Leopold Magnus 03:07:31 That's it. I think we can get this gentleman on Rico. We should wrap them all up, boys. Operation Stinger underway. Let's go find Ratshit and take this colt down.
Dungeon Master 03:07:38 You said that could be fine. He lied and he sort of gets really hostile again, sort of sits back and tries to scoot back his chair.
Zariel Torgan 03:07:39 Bye.
Kaladin Shash 03:07:56 Yeah, we just leave them in the room. You're a dead man. Calm down.
Dungeon Master 03:07:59 You see, he starts to lose it. He's like trying to break the chair from the ground. He's restrained in manacles at the wrists that attach to his feet that are bolted to the ground. He's like pulling against them really hard. You see, he's like losing it as he, you know, is not getting his end of the bargain.
Dungeon Master 03:08:24 He starts laughing hysterically. You don't understand Lear. All dead men for what you've done. He will come. He will purify me and he will desecrate you.
Dungeon Master 03:08:40 And then he goes silent he just almost like unconscious like his body just goes limp and he starts muttering to himself Just then forgive me for that. Please don't die. Don't not the eye of your eyes. I could I could change it again Please forgive me for what I've done. He's just repeating the same thing over and over again As you guys step out and leave them. Um Time for a quick chat. Otherwise, I think we leave it here for now
Dungeon Master 03:09:07 Uh, but you guys have a chance to sort of wrap up with any sort of talk to get out before we end
Leopold Magnus 03:09:15 Yeah. Yeah, I'm pretty good. I think. Absolutely, yeah, we just gotta go. We gotta go wrap him up, you know, do a stink.
Zariel Torgan 03:09:15 I think we're in a good spot. I feel good about it. Yeah. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 03:09:17 I think we did pretty good. We got a key, we got a dude, we can talk to Ham Hock. We know where the cultists meet. That's essentially what the mission was.
Zariel Torgan 03:09:36 Yeah, I say we get another four or five really powerful NPCs, and we disguise ourselves a little bit, and we go in there with a little mini army, take a bunch of them out.
Kaladin Shash 03:09:52 I see.
Leopold Magnus 03:09:53 Yeah, yeah, that's what I was thinking. You could bust through the windows, kick down the door, go arrest them before they can flush the coke. But I'll be standing next to the water tank, a.k.a. the Skettlebutt, just kind of guzzling on some water that's just dribbling through my bones and out the other end.
Leopold Magnus 03:10:19 You'll notice I have got like a fuzzy brown mustache, just like kind of glued across my lip for some reason. Some aviators. Kaladin, that was good work in there.
Zariel Torgan 03:10:24 Hmm.
Dungeon Master 03:10:34 I will say this, I had this going a completely different way. Start, no, there's a whole quest you just missed. Because you're not, yeah, there was gonna be, this is definitely going the path of violence, so you'll get some stuff in the end no matter what, but yeah, this was gonna be,
Kaladin Shash 03:10:40 We still got there. We still got there. Oh.
Leopold Magnus 03:10:49 Because we couldn't go down into the underground.
Dungeon Master 03:11:01 sort of like you get in you infiltrate they ask you to do something for them you get like this side mission that you do or don't go through with and then like once you're in i thought you guys were gonna try to spring it but instantly the the the wrong answer was unfortunate 50 50 shot right um but i also thought you were gonna go to
Leopold Magnus 03:11:19 Yeah, it's tough.
Zariel Torgan 03:11:23 Yeah, I didn't remember what it was either.
Dungeon Master 03:11:27 uh a different chapel and if you had gone to a different chapel you were going to be abducted and sort of like uh introduced through like you know blindfolds on to the place but going to the courtyard instead uh this is not not planned that's the way it goes though sometimes it's not what you think it's gonna be
Leopold Magnus 03:11:48 Man, yeah, none of that happened. That's great. Yeah, I enjoyed playing the bad cop.
Dungeon Master 03:11:57 So, um Just to work out me the stuff right? Yeah, that was funny at the end a good come back up I mean, I mean I've muted a couple times because I couldn't keep it together That's all right ankles just out of nowhere Real talk though, so we're not gonna be able to play next week, correct? You're going on a honeymoon
Zariel Torgan 03:12:11 Bye bye.
Kaladin Shash 03:12:14 You seem to look a bit liberal.
Leopold Magnus 03:12:22 Um, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I won't be able to play the 28th. So we don't leave until, uh, like Saturday. So, yeah, I'll, I'll be in. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Good for next week. And then I'll be gone the next four weeks, basically a month.
Dungeon Master 03:12:32 You'll infer next week then. Okay.
Leopold Magnus 03:12:45 If you guys wanted to play that week of the 22nd, I will get back like Wednesday, so I could potentially play like Saturday or Sunday or some some point. Later, you know, even if we just wanted to do an online thing, but. We're not waiting till the 31st, so I'll be. I'll be in town the 28th.
Dungeon Master 03:13:04 So we've got, I'm sorry, just to verify, you leave the 28th, right? Okay, so we could do a session next week. Okay.
Kaladin Shash 03:13:15 We're playing next week. Yeah. And then when are you back, Rex? I see what you're saying, because you're going to, so we'll essentially miss the whole month of September.
Leopold Magnus 03:13:17 Yes, yeah. The the 25th is when we get back, so that's a Wednesday, so that's why I'm saying we could probably play like Thursday or Friday night like online or maybe I don't know, maybe even in person. Yeah, we could just play like on an off day if that works for everyone or something, yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:13:35 I'm thinking what we do. Yeah. What I'm thinking is we play 28th like normal. Yeah, well not not necessarily in person. What if we just do a normal session next week? I think this is going to be set up for like a pretty big encounter like.
Kaladin Shash 03:13:49 in person that weekend, 28th of September. Yeah. Yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:14:01 You guys are essentially going to organize a strike team. Maybe even multiple strike teams to sort of coordinated attack this place. So I think we do next session build up prep things. Maybe it's a shorter session.
Dungeon Master 03:14:19 You get everything up to date and then we leave the in person session for like when you're back and you can play and we do like a big in person. Maybe even just like drawn out this fight as you fight your way through whatever this hand of God hideout is.
Kaladin Shash 03:14:36 Yeah. That'd be super fun. Sunday the 29th potentially is what we're saying of September. For in person, OK. Either or. I don't think I have anything planned for those. I have to double check, but I think they're fine.
Leopold Magnus 03:14:39 Yeah, that would be really awesome. Yeah, maybe like a Sunday or even Saturday. Yeah, I think because that weekend we'll probably just be taking it easy, but I definitely would. Yeah, I mean, or unless with Saturday works better, I mean, but yeah, I think we can. Cool.
Zariel Torgan 03:15:01 Yeah, it works for me. Yeah, definitely.
Dungeon Master 03:15:05 Okay. Yeah, I'll check my like next month on my counter, but I think that's fine. Uh, and that should be fun. Oh, that was, that was great. Uh, yeah, I uh,
Leopold Magnus 03:15:13 Yeah, awesome. That's a fun role playing there for sure.
Dungeon Master 03:15:32 I was like at first when you guys are like you talk to you didn't even learn his name. His name was, um, Oh, where is he at? Uh, Merrick good barrel, the, the short man who was sort of balding on top. Uh, he sort of also hinted that like, Hey, you should go to this chapel. And then the girl said, Oh, you should go to this chapel. And you guys are like, let's go to this not technically existent
Leopold Magnus 03:15:43 Oh. I was hoping to snag a little Intel there if they were like vampires or something that could have been interesting. But.
Dungeon Master 03:16:00 worship house of the devil instead. I was like, what the fuck? Uh, maybe, you know, the guy you talked to wasn't, but that would be definitely be like the place to look for that kind of stuff. And you, now you're aware it's there. Yeah. You got a little bit of hint of knowledge that there are like,
Zariel Torgan 03:16:05 Thanks for watching!
Kaladin Shash 03:16:05 There you go.
Leopold Magnus 03:16:16 Yeah. Yeah, it might be interesting to know that. That's true, yeah. Yeah, no, I don't. Right.
Dungeon Master 03:16:29 Again, because you had that bad role, you know you missed something. There are, like, the lesser savory gods that don't have much of a role in this campaign, but, like, were the primary bad guys of the last campaign. You should ask Jesse all about Renan.
Leopold Magnus 03:16:46 Yeah, that's sick. That's like kind of has that tie back into the last one. Was that in your campaign? Oh, damn. I guess I didn't pick up on that. Or at least I'd forgotten because yeah, a lot of that stuff.
Zariel Torgan 03:16:53 Mm-hmm. Yeah. There was a cool. Oh yeah. That was all, that was all, uh, last campaign stuff. Well, I don't think Jathan Renan had been mentioned from last campaign into this campaign yet. Yeah. This was the first mention of it, but I remember thinking that was a pretty interesting tie in.
Dungeon Master 03:17:15 They haven't. There have been zero mentions up until now. This is going to be fun.
Leopold Magnus 03:17:23 Yeah, that's really sweet. Yeah, you gotta play the long game. That's why these notes are important. So you can keep track of all that stuff and be like, hey, what about that thing that happened three months ago? But yeah, fun times. We'll see you next Wednesday and hopefully I'll have that summary out the next day or two. Play around with it a bit.
Zariel Torgan 03:17:39 Yeah, awesome.
Dungeon Master 03:17:55 Nice Yeah, I went ahead on the one that you had just posted, uh Six seven I went through and I made a couple edits here and there some of them I left because I thought it was funny but like I said I made like the the page breaks and then like I changed certain things because it was like And zariel turned into a bear and restrained him and I was like he turned into a snake. So that's just way wrong But let me fix it real quick It added like cast lines for people that definitely didn't get said either
Kaladin Shash 03:17:57 Yeah, cool. Those are always super great. We appreciate that.
Leopold Magnus 03:17:57 Cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think that the.
Leopold Magnus 03:18:24 Yeah, I think that the translation from speech to text on the like Slithering noises you made didn't work very well. I don't maybe that confused it. But yeah, I will say that Everyone feel free to update it and like we can kind of crowdsource it so it's accurate to it I mean, I think it does like 85% of the way. Yeah but definitely, yeah, it's I'm always trying to tweak it get it a little better. It's hard because
Dungeon Master 03:18:41 Mm-hmm. It does a great job. Yeah, it's really good Okay, yeah No
Leopold Magnus 03:18:55 They're like, it's just probabilistic, right? It's not like something you can hard code so you get the same thing every time, which is a little bit of a challenge working with those. Cool, yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:19:05 But it's been good enough the last two weeks before I go to prep, like my notes and stuff, I like read over it because it's a really good reminder of like, oh, yeah, this happened, this happened. And when I read through it, I'm like, oh, it doesn't mention that this happened. But now that I'm reading it, I remembered you guys did this instead. Like, it's nice for that. No, it's great. It's really cool.
Leopold Magnus 03:19:24 Right. Yeah. That's why I was hoping a good framework and at least better notes than taking no notes. Yeah. I think it's possible to like, yeah, I could probably build out. It would be really interesting to integrate into like VTT or something. Be kind of a cool, like we'll plug in.
Zariel Torgan 03:19:30 Oh yeah. Yeah.
Kaladin Shash 03:19:32 It is super cool. I've been really loving it.
Dungeon Master 03:19:35 Yeah Yeah, let's do it awesome, that'd be cool um A little bit, but that'd be cool. Um I do encourage you guys to have i'm gonna do what jesse does uh some level of conversation between now and then about like
Leopold Magnus 03:19:50 Yeah, you could just like pull that and then it would automate everything. But that, that would be a lot of work. Try and figure that out. Yeah. Assemble the strike force.
Dungeon Master 03:20:06 How you want to do this, who you want to try to talk to about helping out, things like that. You guys don't know a whole lot of people, so it'll be using the resources you have. I'm so glad you said that, because I did build him out as a character sheet. So he does have a playable character at the moment.
Zariel Torgan 03:20:19 I think that's what it's gonna take. There's absolutely no way we're not bringing Ratchet. He's absolutely riding with us. 100%. Oh, nice.
Kaladin Shash 03:20:35 That's good, we need to rush it.
Dungeon Master 03:20:38 And Ratchet is a cleric. You guys will need some healing.
Leopold Magnus 03:20:44 Yeah, that's a good call. We have a very interesting balance. It's like nobody has really great charisma. Yeah, there's not much in the way of healing. Oh, yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:20:57 No, but I was talking to my buddy, Connor. He's a one of my buddies. I met through Eric. He's like one of the brewers at 10 barrel. He seems interested in playing so I might talk to him about if he can do like a consistent Wednesday commitment kind of deal. Sort of in like the next, you know, month or so in the break. Yeah. And he's pretty cool. The dope guy.
Kaladin Shash 03:21:14 Oh, it'd be like a fourth, round it out. Oh, step in? No way, man, that's funny. The in-person ad's always way more fun.
Leopold Magnus 03:21:17 That would be awesome, man. Yeah, I was trying to get some of my buddies who Portland who play D&D and frequently like if they're ever in town and we're like playing a one shot. Would you guys ever mind if like had had somebody join in on the table? Yeah. Yeah, that's what I was thinking, yeah.
Zariel Torgan 03:21:18 Yeah, that'd be cool. Yeah. Nice. Oh, that'd be great. Oh, yeah.
Dungeon Master 03:21:36 Always down. Next question is, would you want to run it or would you want somebody to run it and you can play in it?
Leopold Magnus 03:21:43 Cool. Well, I'll try to make an effort, see if anybody would want to play. Just have like kind of a fun one shot. Unfortunately, he had... I don't know. I've never actually run a campaign. I'd have to put in some practice, figure that out.
Dungeon Master 03:22:07 They started with a one shot, you know. And the great thing about running the one shot is you can kind of make up whatever rules you want and say that they're law. So even if you were like, I don't totally know what I'm doing, this is what I'm saying is the law.
Leopold Magnus 03:22:09 Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think that's kind of the way to do it. Yeah. Do a little one shot. I could, I could try and figure that out. That'd be fun. Oh, sure. Yeah. Yes. Right. That's a good point.
Kaladin Shash 03:22:22 Oh my gosh.
Zariel Torgan 03:22:26 Yeah. That's rough.
Leopold Magnus 03:22:28 Yeah, unfortunately, that guy, he was running a campaign, but the people he's playing with were like almost completely disinterested in D&D. And so apparently they didn't even get through one encounter from like they played for like months and they didn't even get through one encounter. And I was like, holy shit, dude. And he's like, yeah, I gave him every out. I did everything. I was like, oh, man, you got to play with like a serious group if you're playing, you know.
Dungeon Master 03:22:37 Yeah. That's really. The theorist group makes all the difference.
Leopold Magnus 03:22:55 I mean, you know, like to a certain extent, you're just having fun, but like, you gotta be interested in playing the game for sure, so. But, cool. Well, right on, yeah, I'll mull that over. Maybe I'll come up with a fun campaign to do a little one shot on or something.
Kaladin Shash 03:23:01 Yeah.
Zariel Torgan 03:23:03 crazy yeah yeah it sounds great my only suggestion would be to to
Dungeon Master 03:23:14 Yeah.

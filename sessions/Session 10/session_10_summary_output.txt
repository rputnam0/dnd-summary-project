The air in the subterranean chapel, thick with dust and the metallic tang of shed ichor, crackled with lingering divine power. Deep beneath the Court of Viteo, the newly christened O’dears and their beleaguered handler, Ratchet, found themselves locked in a desperate struggle. The frail form of Father Kallor had erupted into The Reverend, an angelic terror of gold and light, wings beating a furious rhythm as he hovered thirty feet above, his very presence an affront to the mortal coil. Two lesser, yet still formidable, divine beings, remnants of Kallor's monks, pressed the attack on the ground.

Kaladin, his wizard’s mind racing, knew the fight here was but one piece of a city-wide conflagration. He’d heard the fractured comms, the reports of chaos. His first instinct, even as The Reverend’s unholy light seared the air, was for the mysterious Fey Woman. "Captain Levi," his voice crackled over the Legionnaire network, "I need you to go immediately to the Med Bay! The attackers are there now. The girl with the mask needs to be protected!" Levi’s terse reply, whipped by wind as he raced towards the Core, was a grim affirmation. "You don't think I fucking know that? I'm on my way... Why would they want this girl?" A question that would haunt Kaladin even as he loosed a Fire Bolt, the arcane energy streaking wide of the hovering demigod.

Meanwhile, Ratchet, ever the stalwart cleric despite his scrawny frame, saw Zariel fall. With a desperate dash that drew a glancing blow, he reached the druid, a surge of healing light knitting Zariel’s wounds. "Nice," Zariel gasped, scrambling up, only for The Reverend to turn his burning gaze upon Ratchet, a Guiding Bolt of radiant fury slamming into the half-orc. Yet, when The Reverend descended in a blur of speed, his immense blade scything down, fate, or perhaps sheer clumsiness, intervened. "He sort of just back steps at first," the scene unfolded, "not intentionally he had just gone to heal and maybe tripped a little bit and just misses the blade it hits the ground and explodes and it throws him backwards... pretty much surviving by luck." The Reverend, denied his prey, let loose a Lair Action, divine power washing over him and his remaining acolytes, mending their wounds.

"You got it, Dottie! You're doing great out there!" Leopold, ever the pragmatist with a flair for the dramatic, yelled encouragement from behind a brazier before his own armor seemed to shift and sigh. Gears whirred as his Steel Defender, "Bone Crusher" emblazoned on its backplate, peeled away from his frame, a lithe, chicken-legged construct of whirling metal and blue-glowing eyes. A well-aimed Magic Stone from Leopold struck The Reverend, a small victory in the overwhelming tide.

The battle ebbed and flowed, a brutal ballet of divine power and desperate mortal resilience. Kaladin’s spear found its mark on an undead monk, while his Shield spell and shimmering Mirror Images deflected a flurry of blows. But The Reverend was relentless. His Legendary Actions were a storm of attacks, and Ratchet was felled again, skewered through the shoulder. Then, in a moment of grim fortune for the heroes, the cavern wall exploded inwards. Silhouetted against the dust and debris was Sylvaris Sunseeker, Omen Knight leader, his obsidian armor cracked, his handsome face bloodied. "Okay guys," he panted, sword loose in his grip, "what the fuck is going on?"

Zariel, revived once more by Kaladin's quick thinking and a Legionnaire syringe, unleashed an Ice Knife that caught The Reverend in a shower of frigid shards. But the angelic being was a whirlwind of destruction. Another blast of divine energy, and Zariel was down again, unconscious. As he lay there, a Lair Action, a Divine Beam of searing light, lanced from the stained-glass window above, striking his prone form. Kaladin and Leopold watched in stunned horror as Zariel’s flesh, or what appeared to be flesh, burned away from his forearms and elbow, revealing the unmistakable glint of "finely sinewed muscle of like metal instead... ropey metallic... an articulating joint." The druid, their friend, was something more, or perhaps something other, than they had ever imagined. Kaladin, caught in the beam’s afterglow, found his vision swimming, temporarily blinded.

It was Leopold who turned the tide. Seeing Zariel fall, then witnessing the horrific revelation, a fury ignited within the warforged. "Leave my friend alone!" he roared, charging forward. He scooped a hefty stone from the broken floor, his internal mechanisms thrumming. "EAT RUGS, REVEREND!" With a booming sound like a human cannon, the rock launched from his core, striking the angelic being hard. The Reverend staggered, his celestial fortitude wavering. Another stone, this one infused with even greater force, catapulted from Leopold. It struck true, a devastating impact. "The Reverend looks left and right," the DM intoned, "realizing his undoing and collapses headfirst onto the floor." As he fell, the massive, metallic greatsword in his grasp clinked to the ground, its radiant sheen dimming, the shards of metal reverting to pieces of colored stained glass, still hovering in the shape of a longsword.

With their master vanquished, the remaining undead monks, tears of gold streaking their faces, were dispatched by the combined might of a vengeful Kaladin and the wounded but still formidable Sylvaris. As the last enemy fell, Sylvaris slumped. "Alright, guys. That was... pretty intense," he managed. "My other friends didn't make it. They died in the tunnel." He recounted the ambush, the overwhelming numbers, his voice heavy with loss.

The immediate crisis quelled, Kaladin contacted Captain Levi. The news from the Core was dire. "Fellas... I made it to the bay," Levi’s voice was strained. "This woman... she's she's made of stone right now. They they took the mask and ran." The culprit? Cedric, the pit fighter. "They got through these tunnels, and I'm thinking they're heading one way, and that's your way."

While Kaladin processed this, Zariel, his senses heightened by traces of his earlier Faerie Fire, perceived faint, ethereal footprints near the stairs. A new casting of the spell, and the footprints, along with an unsettling "off" sensation that had plagued the chapel, vanished. Kaladin, too, caught a fleeting, familiar scent – wildflowers, just like the Fey Woman’s mask. Cedric had been there.

Exhausted, their resources depleted, the party agreed to a short rest. Sylvaris, ever the Omen Knight, took the unconscious Ratchet back to the Legionnaire Core. During their respite, the party overheard comms chatter detailing the Med Bay attack: guards slain, Cedric leading the charge, his escape. The path back to the barracks was somber.

The long rest brought little peace, only more troubling visions. Kaladin found himself in a sheer fabric octagon, then a field of golden amber wheat, voices whispering of "rulers" and "one of us is special." Zariel relived a memory: a city of copper buildings on a cliffside, a robed figure speaking to him – or *through* him – "How do you know you're just a robot? Is she worth the cost?"

Morning brought a fragile dawn and a heavy conversation. "There may or may not be a chance that we're a lot more similar than I thought we were," Zariel began, finally voicing his fears to Kaladin and Leopold. He spoke of his dreams, the word "robot," the metallic glint beneath his skin. "I need to do some research," he admitted, fear and confusion warring in his voice. Leopold, with surprising gentleness, asked, "Zario, what's a robot?" then quipped, "I did see you eat a spider though, Kaladin," a moment of levity in the heavy air.

The debrief with Captain Levi and a recovering Ratchet (arm in a sling, voice raspy) was a litany of grim reports and hard truths. The party recounted their victory, the nature of The Reverend, the strange liquids. Levi confirmed the Med Bay attack, the Fey Woman's petrification, Cedric’s escape. He also announced Sylvaris Sunseeker’s retirement. "He says it just wasn't quite a good fit for him. Verbatim." Then, a shift: "Seeing as such, there is a promotion available for you guys... to Omen Knight rank." With it came vouchers for armor upgrades. Ratchet, however, had less welcome news: no cash reward for this "informal contract," though he pointed to their tavern winnings with a wry look.

The session concluded, as it often did, at the Legionnaire lottery machine. Leopold received a porcelain-faced doll, which he perched on his shoulder. Kaladin pulled a vial containing a strange, swirling potion of what looked like liquid wood. And Zariel, with a final clunk, received a tiny red toolbox, no bigger than his thumb. As he fiddled with its latch, it suddenly expanded to a foot square, revealing a ladder descending into an inky darkness within.

The battle for the soul of the Dawn District was won, but the war for New New Arbor, and for the Fey Woman, had taken a devastating turn. New powers, new responsibilities, and a host of new, unsettling mysteries now lay before the O’dears.

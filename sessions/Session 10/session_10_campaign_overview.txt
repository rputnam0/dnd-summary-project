Provided comms updates during the operation, reporting thousands of cultists emerging city-wide ("This is huge") and then that the Legionnaire Core itself was under attack. Dispatched his mage from chapel surveillance and stated he was heading back to the Core.
    *   **(Session 10 Update):** Communicated with Kaladin during the battle against The Reverend, confirming he was en route to the Med Bay. Later reported to the party via comms that the Fey Woman had been turned to stone after Cedric stole her mask during an attack on the Med Bay, and that Cedric had escaped through tunnels, possibly heading towards their location. He debriefed the party post-battle at HQ, gathered information about The Reverend's defeat, confirmed Sylvaris Sunseeker's retirement, and promoted Kaladin, Leopold, and Zariel to Omen Knight rank, providing armor upgrade vouchers. Tasked Ratchet with getting a sample of the liquid from the mausoleum. *(Status: Active at Legionnaire HQ, managing fallout from cult uprising and Med Bay attack, promoted the party).*
*   **Lord Marshall Thurr:** High-ranking Stonewall Legionnaire leader. 'Bear of a man', beard, scar, cob pipe. Observed tryouts. Confirmed Legionnaire interest in Isoptic Curse. Endorsed Levi's offer. Fought alongside party against Cursed Fire Elemental. Initiated the cursed soldier program. Conducted Kaladin's post-mission briefing regarding the fey woman and Lancex. Briefed the party and Omen Knights on the Moonhaven expedition and the associated festival, outlining the party's "Watchdog" role. Granted Kaladin's request (Persuasion Nat 20) for party involvement in the fey woman's care. Oversaw the festival and ordered the Arcane Splitter's activation. During the subsequent werewolf and cultist attack, he was persuaded by Leopold to remain and manage the Splitter, sending his "Blackguard" Knight through instead. Abruptly departed the battle after receiving a comm from a calm female voice requesting his presence elsewhere.
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Returned to Legionnaire HQ. Attended the urgent Hand of God cult briefing, allocating significant resources: Ratchet to lead the party's group, Levi to lead a strike team, and an Omen Knight task force. Privately informed Kaladin that he (Thurr) is under scrutiny by the council and suspects a leak within the government, tying up his personal involvement in the field. Captain Levi mentioned in Session 10 "Lord Marshall will be in touch when he can." *(Status: Active, at Legionnaire HQ, dealing with internal political issues and suspected leak, expected to contact party eventually)*
*   **Hamhawk:** Ogre-like female humanoid smithy for the Legionnaires. Gruff, efficient, protective of her advanced forge (Storm District). Underbite, sharp canines, glasses, blonde pigtail.

Revealed Splitter's purpose (Moonhaven). Received final component, confirmed completion. Continued rebuffing Leopold's apprenticeship attempts. Informed party Ratshit was looking for them. Upgraded Kaladin's and Zariel's armor to medium for cost of materials. Zariel perceived a blueprint on her lab table. Leopold's attempt to persuade her to contact him for jobs was met with noncommittal silence.
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Quickly upgraded the party's comms system with a quiet/loud toggle. Was observed by the party working on a schematic for a new "plasma sword" design. Impressed by Leopold's suggestion for an internal power source for the sword, she offered him a conditional apprenticeship if he could find a suitable energy source. *(Status: Active at her forge)*.
*   **Donnie Farsight (Ratshit):** Malnourished-looking half-orc handler for the party. Cynical, fast-talking. Explained barracks procedures, gear, pay/lottery. Delivered gear and first mission folder. Relayed Levi's summons. Facilitated return to HQ and briefings. Deceived by Leopold's prank. Explained reward options. Conveyed Thurr's instruction about Lancex's club. Provided "Watchdog" assignment, requested party name. After festival attack, debriefed party, praised Zariel. Lied to Leopold about civilian casualty (Zariel detected lie). Assigned mission: find "The Hand of God" cult leader (alive), suggesting starting in Dawn District/Spit and Swallow. Stated "nobody called [Thurr] off," contradicting party's intel. Received party's report on Cedric/chapel lead. Seen using arcane rune wrist guard projecting to a pad for input. Stated Dawn District is not his primary responsibility (Storm District is). Denied Kaladin's request for an armor voucher. Rudely dismissed Leopold's offer to help with paperwork ("You are my fucking subordinate. Get the fuck out of here.").
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Documented ("Meeting 435") the Hand of God cult briefing. Assigned by Thurr to lead and accompany the party's infiltration group. Provided them with extra gear (enchanted cuffs, arcane stun grenades, extra healing). Joined the party in the mausoleum infiltration. In the "mass suicide" chamber, detected "off" radiant energy coating residue in cups, expressing unease. Provided combat support with Bless, Guidance (to Leopold), Shatter, and Toll the Dead. Argued with Leopold mid-combat about the metaphysics of healing Zariel's bear form. Took 20 damage from an Undead Soldier.
    *   **(Session 10 Update):** Fought alongside the party against The Reverend, providing crucial healing (Healing Word on Zariel) and re-establishing Bless. Took significant damage, was knocked unconscious by The Reverend, healed by Zariel, then knocked unconscious again by an Undead Soldier. Failed one death save, then made a successful one (Nat 19). Was stabilized by Leopold's Medicine check and evacuated from The Reverend's chapel by Sylvaris Sunseeker. Recovered enough by the next morning to be present at the debriefing with Captain Levi (arm in a sling), taking notes. Informed the party there was no cash reward for the mission, citing their promotion and tavern winnings as compensation. Facilitated their use of the Legionnaire lottery machine. *(Status: Active, recovering from injuries at Legionnaire HQ, continues role as party handler).*
*   **Selena Sal:** Eccentric, seemingly ancient potion shop owner (Storm District). Huge goggles, messy bun, patchwork muumuu. Potentially senile or feigning it. Has a talking hermit crab, Marcel. Her shop contains the hidden entrance to the Fungal Tunnels. Her involvement/awareness remains unknown. *(Not encountered Session 2-10)*.
*   **Lancex the Fungal Guardian:** Former Stonewall Legionnaire assimilated and mutated into a powerful Myconid Sovereign variant. His club's magic was transferred to Kaladin's weapon. *(Status: Deceased/Destroyed)*
*   **Mysterious Woman on Altar:** Young, fair-skinned woman with dirty brown hair. Wears a well-crafted glass mask filled with living plants. Mask emits powerful, chaotic Fey magic vital for her survival. Turned over to Legionnaire command, housed in secure medical sub-level under Thurr's supervision. Party has access runes. Condition was unconscious. Kaladin feels connection to mask. Zariel found facility familiar, felt faint connection to her. Thurr noted unique magic. Kaladin's dreams suggest a connection to an entity trying to get "out."
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Still unconscious in the Legionnaire Med Bay. Her location became under direct threat, as Beatrice (Med Bay staff) reported to Kaladin that intruders were trying to breach the Med Bay doors during the city-wide cultist uprising.
    *   **(Session 10 Update):** Her mask was stolen by Cedric during an attack he led on the Legionnaire Med Bay.

Location remains Legionnaire Med Bay.)*

    *   **Abilities & Curse:** Challenged the party after their pit victories. Possesses significant power linked to the Isoptric Curse. Can unleash energy to heal/empower others (leveled party to 4). In combat, uses multi-attack (fists, kick), Calculated Loss (bonus action move/debuff), legendary actions for extra attacks, inflicts delayed radiant damage, and applies conditions (Stun via Tunnel Vision, Action Denial via Out of Breath) on hits via CON saves. Under pressure, underwent a transformation: radiant energy pulsed, veins glowed, eyes shone, forearms gained golden inlay, power increased but control seemed diminished (similar to Fire Elemental transformation). Claimed to channel power from the goddess Viteo, but the transformation felt unprecedented/uncontrolled to him.
    *   **Hand of God Connection:** Confirmed affiliation with the "Hand of God" cult, acting as a "scouter" finding talent for them. Provided the party with the cult's base location (a chapel basement in the Dawn District) and gave them his Hand symbol token as a potential means of access/introduction. Became defensive when pressed by Leopold about direct involvement. Spotted by Leopold attending Father Kallor's sermon at the Court of Viteo. Xander (cultist) later confirmed Cedric recruits for the cult.
    *   **(Session 10 Update):** Led an attack on the Legionnaire Med Bay. His forces killed guards, and he personally stole the Fey Woman's mask, causing her to turn to stone. He then escaped through tunnels and is currently at large. His actions have escalated him to a primary antagonist. *(Status: At large, actively hostile, responsible for Fey Woman's petrification and mask theft. Primary target for the Legionnaires and party.)*
*   **High Cleric Father Kallor / The Reverend:** Formerly presented as an old, frail-appearing public figure (poofs of gray hair, smacking lips, obscured eyes, large gray-brown robes, carries a large chained tome), High Cleric of the Court of Viteo running for council.
    *   **(Session 9 Revelation):** Revealed himself to be **"The Reverend,"** the fanatical leader of the "Hand of God" cult. Confronted the party in his hidden chapel/cavern beneath the Court of Viteo. Monologued about serving "Teo, God of Wrath," an alleged primordial, suppressed aspect of Viteo, and his mission to "cleanse this world." Attempted to convert the party.
    *   **Transformation & Abilities:** Upon being damaged by Leopold, Kallor's body convulsed and exploded with light, transforming him into **The Reverend:** a powerful, floating angelic being with expansive wings, eyes emblazoned in light, and wielding a large, broken-but-hovering greatsword summoned from a stained-glass window. His attacks deal significant physical and radiant damage (e.g., Guiding Bolt). Possessed Lair Actions (summoned Undead Soldiers from fallen monks, healed self and allies, Divine Beam) and Legendary Actions (extra attacks, Battlefield Rejection debuff).
    *   **(Session 10 Update):** Continued his fierce battle against the party and Ratchet. Utilized Guiding Bolt, Lair Actions (Divine Reinforcement healing, Divine Beam which blinded Kaladin and revealed Zariel's metallic components), and Legendary Actions (multiple attacks, Battlefield Rejection). Was ultimately defeated by Leopold's Catapult spell using a rock. His body (described as 9ft tall, humanoid but not human, with "gold metallic dust of skin" and "gold blood") lies in his chapel. His greatsword transformed into a stained-glass longsword upon his death, which Kaladin recovered. Leopold collected a sample of his "gold blood." *(Status: Deceased. Body remains in his chapel. Transformed weapon recovered by Kaladin. Cult uprising he initiated continues.)*
*   **Xander (Cultist Groundskeeper):** "Devilishly handsome" male with Tiefling-esque features. Publicly a groundskeeper at the Court of Viteo, tending rose bushes. Secretly a member and gatekeeper for "The Hand of God" cult. When the party approached the mausoleum, he tested them with a "justice or wrath?" question (Kaladin answered "justice"). Later charmed by Leopold (failed Wisdom save, Nat 2). Under charm, he confirmed "wrath" was the correct answer, expressed trust in Leopold (but not his friends), and gave Leopold his key to the mausoleum. Was then convinced by Leopold to leave the grounds and was subsequently abducted by the party and taken to a Legionnaire holding cell. During interrogation (after charm wore off), he revealed the Hand of God cult operates in extensive tunnels beneath the main Viteo chapel, has hundreds of members (many poor folk "fed" by the leader), and is led by "The Reverend." Confirmed Cedric is a recruiter. Warned the party they are marked and will die, then suffered a mental breakdown, muttering about purification and desecration. Found with a short sword and a hidden bent-finger Hand of God talisman. *(Status: Captured by party, interrogated, held in Legionnaire HQ, mentally unstable. His key was used by the party to access the mausoleum tunnels.)*
*   **Sylvaris Sunseeker (Omen Knight Leader):** Tall, elven-heritage man with striking blonde hair, a cut jawline, and a muscular build. Wore intricate, deep obsidian black armor that radiates a magical aura. Arrogant and confident. Leader of the Omen Knight task force assigned by Thurr to assist the party's assault on the Hand of God cult. Introduced his team as "Laser, Blazer, and Taser." Coordinated with the party on their entry point into a secondary cult location.
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Shortly after infiltration began, his panicked voice was heard over comms: "Anybody who could pick this up? It was a trap. We're fucking surrounded... Send somebody." The transmission then cut out.
    *   **(Session 10 Update):** Burst into The Reverend's chapel mid-battle, heavily injured (armor broken, face bloodied). Reported that his Omen Knight team (Laser, Blazer, Taser) had been ambushed in another temple and were all killed. He fought his way through more cultists to reach the party. Assisted the party in defeating the remaining Undead Soldiers, showcasing significant combat prowess despite his injuries (killed one with his greatsword). After the battle, he evacuated the unconscious Ratchet back to Legionnaire HQ. Captain Levi later reported that Sylvaris had officially retired from the Omen Knights, stating "it just wasn't quite a good fit for him." *(Status: Alive, but heavily injured and traumatized. Retired from the Omen Knights.)*

*   **Festival Attack and Rise of "The Hand of God":** During a public festival celebrating an Omen Knight expedition to Moonhaven (enabled by the newly activated Arcane Splitter), a monstrous werewolf attacked Legionnaires outside the dome while extremist cultists, identified as "The Hand of God," simultaneously launched a coordinated assault from within the festival.

Kallor transformed into a powerful angelic being. The party, with aid from an injured Sylvaris Sunseeker, defeated The Reverend in a climactic battle (Session 10). Simultaneously, the cult had launched a massive, coordinated uprising across New New Arbor, with an Omen Knight task force ambushed and wiped out, and the Legionnaire Core itself coming under attack. The city-wide crisis continues.
*   **Theft of the Fey Woman's Mask and Her Petrification (Session 10):** While the party battled The Reverend, Cedric (the pit fighter champion and Hand of God scouter) led an attack on the Legionnaire Med Bay. He successfully stole the Mysterious Fey Woman's life-sustaining mask, causing her to instantly turn to stone. Cedric escaped, becoming a primary target.

A known hub for the "Hand of God" cult; the pit champion, Cedric, acts as a "scouter" for them here. Site of the party's investigation and subsequent pit fights.
    *   **Fighting Pit (Spit and Swallow):** A large, sand-filled pit dug into the floor of the Spit and Swallow tavern. Used for bare-knuckle and armed combat with associated betting, managed by a gnome bookie. Site of the party's fights against Alara, Rurik, and Thrag, and their subsequent challenging fight against Cedric.
*   **Talisman Vendor's Cart (Dawn District):** A wheeled cart operated by Merrick Goodbarrel, typically found in the Dawn District. Sells Viteo talismans (depicting an outward-facing palm with spread fingers).
*   **Robe Vendor's Stall (Dawn District):** A market stall in the Dawn District where Serafina sells basic tan robes.
*   **"House of the Devil" (Dawn District):** A place of worship for followers of Renan, the Lord of Destruction. Accessed through a hole in a broken-down building wall, marked by a scratched wood plaque. Descends into a dark common room with stone pillars, private altars, and murals depicting Renan. Offers a "safe harbor" for alternative faiths.
*   **Court of Viteo (Main Viteo Chapel, Dawn District):** A massive Viteo chapel in the Dawn District with vaulted ceilings and faint holy music. Features a marble archway entrance ("Court of Viteo Holy House"), a main sanctuary with pews and an altar, and High Cleric Father Kallor's private office.
    *   `Courtyard & Mausoleum Entrance:` A well-maintained courtyard behind the chapel with flowers, gravestones of important figures, leading to a sunken stone mausoleum entrance. The mausoleum itself (when opened by Xander with his key turned right) was revealed to be an illusory monitoring room. The true entrance to the Hand of God cult's hidden base is believed to be accessed via this mausoleum entrance/key, likely by turning the key left ("wrath"). *(Party successfully used Xander's key here to infiltrate - Session 9)*.
    *   `Underground Cult Base (Beneath Court of Viteo - Partially Explored by Party):` An extensive network of tunnels located deep underground, directly beneath the main Court of Viteo chapel.
        *   `Mass Gathering Chamber / "Mass Ritual" Room:` Large, empty chamber found immediately after descending the mausoleum stairs. Contained hundreds of discarded cups with an alchemical residue (which caused Zariel's mouse to hallucinate) and freshly snuffed candles. Ratchet detected an "off" radiant energy coating the residue. Implied site of a mass ritual, poisoning, or administration of a transformative substance (Session 9).
        *   `Carved Stone Tunnels:` Network of unlit tunnels with smoldering, unlit torches, leading deeper from the Mass Gathering Chamber (Session 9).
        *   `The Reverend's Chapel/Cavern:` A huge, broken-down chapel within a natural cavern, deep beneath the Court of Viteo. Has no intact roof or windows, except for a large stained-glass window at the far end (from which The Reverend summoned his greatsword). Contains a weathered altar, dust, cobwebs, and is lit by dim, cold light from sconces. The air is thick and still. Site of the party's climactic confrontation with Father Kallor, his transformation into The Reverend, and the ensuing battle (Session 9-10). The Reverend's body now lies here. Kaladin recovered his transformed stained-glass sword, and Leopold took a sample of his "gold blood". Contains evidence of lingering magical traces (faint footprints perceived by Zariel, scent of wildflowers perceived by Kaladin). Has outlets leading to other tunnels.

## Ongoing Mysteries & Goals

*   What is the full nature, origin, and range of effects of the Isoptic Curse? (Note: Stress Point activation observed. Cedric demonstrated significant power increase, transformation. Father Kallor transformed into the powerful angelic being, The Reverend, possibly another manifestation or divinely amplified curse. The Reverend's unique physiology (gold blood, angelic form) provide further examples of its extreme manifestations. Cost/drawbacks still largely unknown.)
*   What are the details surrounding Zariel's memory loss and 'accident'? What is the significance of his dream of stasis/medical care? (Note: Metallic sheen. Legionnaire medical facility felt "somewhat familiar". Dream of "Project." While unconscious during the battle with The Reverend (Session 10), Zariel experienced a vivid vision/memory of seeing his own metallic hand, hearing ratcheting sounds, and someone saying "This one's awake, put him out." Simultaneously, his actual metallic components (forearms, elbow joint) were physically revealed when his flesh was burned by divine energy, witnessed by Kaladin and Leopold. He later confided in the party about these experiences and his dreams of being a 'robot,' confirming his Warforged nature and a traumatic, experimental past. He had further visions of a man in silk robes, texts about 'far north' and 'the tree,' and a 'copper city' with a voice questioning 'Is she worth the cost?')
*   What happened during Leopold's past (deactivation, memory issues)? What is the story behind his "Bone Grinder" emblem? Was his brother truly an Omen Knight named Victor? What did his dream signify? (Note: Memory flashes. Felt recognition with Blackguard Knight. Encountered scribe Victor Holloway. Spotted "Dome Exploration" assignment. Omen Knight Laser (now deceased) mentioned seeing the "Bone Crusher" emblem on someone "higher up" in the Legionnaires.)
*   What were Kaladin's specific dreams motivating him? What is the nature of his connection to the Feywild/past lives hinted at in dreams/vision? (Note: Potent Fey magic discovered. Researched Feywild. Connection to fey woman's mask. Disturbing dreams. Experienced a new dream in Session 10: a sheer fabric octagon, then a field of golden amber wheat, with voices speaking of 'rulers' and 'one of us is special.' He also perceived a faint scent of wildflowers near The Reverend's remains, similar to the Fey Woman's mask.)
*   What are the potential consequences or drawbacks of using Stress Points? (Note: Power demonstrated, 3 used by Zariel, 1 by Leopold. Cost remains unknown. Zariel collapsed after using two in Session 6.)
*   Who was the figure Kaladin saw watching him before the tryouts?
*   What is the significance of Zariel's red-tipped orchid?
*   How common is the Isoptic Curse? How is it perceived? (Note: Thurr actively recruiting/testing. Cedric example. The Reverend's transformation could be related.)
*   What is the full power structure of the Stonewall Legionnaires and New New Arbor? What is the significance of the Omen Knights and Alabaster Lords? (Note: Omen Knights elite. Thurr commands "Blackguard." Zariel's dream mentioned a "Council member." High Cleric Kallor ran for council. Lord Marshall Thurr privately informed Kaladin he is under scrutiny by the council and suspects a significant leak within the government itself.)
*   What is the significance of Captain Levi's meeting regarding another domed city? (Note: Related to Moonhaven mission, which was attacked.)
*   What is the nature and origin of the Myconids in the Fungal Tunnels? What is their goal? (Note: Assimilate victims, guarded Fey presence. Lancex was test subject. Source/motive unknown.)
*   Where are the missing people from the Storm District? (Note: Lancex found. Others unknown. "Hand of God" cult a factor. Father Kallor reported missing poor folk. The "mass ritual/suicide" chamber in the cult's base might account for some missing individuals in a grim manner. The city-wide uprising indicates vast numbers of active cultists.)
*   Is Selena Sal involved with, complicit in, or ignorant of the Myconid/Fey activity beneath her shop?
*   What is the significance of the small film reel Leopold received?
*   What will happen on Leopold's arranged "date" with Marcel the Hermit Crab?
*   Who/what is the mysterious woman found on the altar? What is the purpose/nature of her plant-filled mask and connection to Fey magic? (Note: Mask vital. Was in Legionnaire care. Kaladin's dreams/connection. Her mask was stolen by Cedric in Session 10 during an attack on the Legionnaire Med Bay. Upon its removal, she instantly turned to stone (petrified). Her restoration and the recovery of her mask are now critical goals.)
*   Who is the "he" that Lancex warned is "coming for her"? (Note: Phrase echoed in Kaladin's nightmare. Kaladin's dream voice ("Let me out"). Cedric's direct attack on her and theft of her mask in Session 10 makes him a strong candidate, or an agent of this 'he'.)
*   What is the full extent and origin of the Fey magic presence in the Fungal Tunnels?
*   What are the Omen Knights' specific roles, powers, and allegiances? (Note: Elite squad. Moonhaven team ambushed. Thurr's "Blackguard" Knight. Sylvaris Sunseeker's Omen Knight task force (Laser, Blazer, Taser) was ambushed and confirmed wiped out by Hand of God cultists in Session 10. Sylvaris himself retired due to the trauma. The party (Kaladen, Leopold, Zariel) were promoted to Omen Knight rank in Session 10.)
*   What was the significance of the Albatross blood drawing ("one for sorrow") found in the tunnels?
*   What is the creature from Kaladin's dream? (Note: Original dream involved spider-like creature. New dream involved a pit and voice.)
*   What truly happened to Moonhaven to cause its silence? (Note: Omen Knight mission launched, immediately attacked. Status of Moonhaven itself unknown.)
*   What are the full capabilities and implications of Project Splitter (now Arcane Splitter)? (Note: Successfully created temporary dome opening. Revealed extreme danger outside dome.)
*   Who is the calm female voice that commanded Lord Marshall Thurr via comms? Why does Ratshit deny that Thurr was officially recalled?
*   What is the full extent, leadership, and ultimate goal of "The Hand of God" cult? Why did they attack the festival? (Note: Base beneath Court of Viteo. Xander's intel. Leader identified as High Cleric Father Kallor, who revealed himself as "The Reverend." He worships "Teo, God of Wrath," an alleged suppressed, primordial aspect of Viteo, and aims to "cleanse the world." Kallor transformed into a powerful angelic being and was defeated by the party in Session 10. The cult uses alchemical substances in rituals. They have launched a massive, coordinated city-wide uprising involving thousands of cultists and are attacking key locations, including the Legionnaire Core. Key agents like Cedric are still at large.)
*   What happened to Lord Marshall Thurr after his abrupt departure during the festival attack? Is he safe, and what was the nature of the summons he received? (Resolved in Session 9) (He returned to HQ, briefed the party, and revealed he is under council scrutiny and investigating an internal leak.)
*   What is the nature of Leopold's "click" of recognition with the Blackguard Knight? Is there a connection to his past, potentially his brother Victor? (Note: Memory flash. Scribe Victor Holloway. Omen Knight Laser (now deceased) mentioned seeing the "Bone Crusher" emblem on someone "higher up.")
*   What will the Omen Knights (and the deployed Blackguard) find at Moonhaven, and what will be their ultimate fate against the werewolf and other potential external threats?
*   Why did the Legionnaire medical facility feel "somewhat familiar" to Zariel, and does it connect to his lost memories or nature? (Note: Dream reinforces connection to medical/experimental setting. His Warforged nature and experimental past now confirmed via vision and physical evidence in Session 10.)
*   What is the significance of the recurring "metallic sheen" observed on Zariel, particularly on his fur when in Dire Wolf form? (Note: A metallic glint was observed by Kaladin and Leopold in Zariel's shoulder wound in Session 9. In Session 10, his actual metallic components (forearms, elbow joint) were revealed when his flesh was burned by divine energy. His vision confirmed a metallic hand. His Warforged nature is now confirmed to the party.)
*   What is Cedric's exact role within the Hand of God cult ("scouter")? What is the nature and source of his significant magical abilities (Isoptric Curse, Viteo channeling)? What were his motives for testing and empowering the party before fighting them? (Note: Claimed uncontrolled power surge. Xander confirmed Cedric is a recruiter. Cedric attends Father Kallor's sermons. Kallor being The Reverend solidifies Cedric's role as a direct agent. Escalated significantly in Session 10: led an attack on the Legionnaire Med Bay, stole the Fey Woman's mask causing her petrification, and escaped. He is now a primary antagonist.)
*   What is the origin and purpose of the mysterious yellow lubricant Zariel found on his knuckle in the barracks?
*   Is the library scribe Victor Holloway connected in any way to Leopold's brother Victor?
*   What is the identity and true nature/power of "The Reverend," leader of the Hand of God cult? (Resolved in Session 9) (High Cleric Father Kallor. Transforms into powerful angelic being. Worshipper of "Teo, God of Wrath".)
*   How does "The Reverend" feed and control hundreds of cultists in the hidden tunnels? (Note: Xander said he "feeds" them. The "mass ritual" chamber with alchemical residue might be related.)
*   What is the significance of the "purification" and "desecration" Xander mentioned? (Note: The Reverend's goal is to "cleanse this world.")
*   What will be the cult's response to Xander's capture and disappearance? (Note: They have launched a city-wide uprising; Xander's capture is likely a minor factor now.)
*   What is the true nature of Viteo's "wrath" aspect that the Hand of God cult seems to embody? (Note: The Reverend (Kallor) confirmed he serves "Teo, God of Wrath," an alleged primordial, suppressed aspect of Viteo.)
*   Is Father Kallor truly unaware of the massive cult operation beneath his chapel, or is he complicit/involved? (Resolved in Session 9) (He is The Reverend, the leader.)
*   What is the full nature and origin of "Teo, God of Wrath," the entity The Reverend claims to serve?
*   What is the true extent of the council leak Lord Marshall Thurr suspects within the Legionnaire/New New Arbor government? Who is involved?
*   Will the party (and Ratchet) survive the encounter with The Reverend? What will be the immediate consequences of this battle? (Resolved in Session 10 regarding survival; consequences ongoing) (The party and Ratchet survived. The Reverend was defeated. Immediate consequences include Zariel's Warforged nature revealed, Sylvaris's team lost, party promoted, Fey Woman petrified by Cedric.)
*   What happened to Sylvaris Sunseeker and his Omen Knight task force? Are any of them alive? (Resolved in Session 10) (Sylvaris survived but his team (Laser, Blazer, Taser) was wiped out. Sylvaris retired.)
*   Can the Legionnaires contain the massive, city-wide cultist uprising? What is the current status across New New Arbor?
*   What is the specific nature of the attack on the Legionnaire Core and the Med Bay? Who is Beatrice, the Med Bay staffer who contacted Kaladin? (Note: The Med Bay attack was led by Cedric, who stole the Fey Woman's mask. Beatrice's report was accurate.)
*   What was the alchemical substance in the cups in the "mass ritual/suicide" chamber, and what was its exact purpose (e.g., ritual empowerment, poison, transformative agent)?
*   What further details will Zariel uncover about his experimental past and Warforged nature? How will the confirmation of his metallic components and the vision affect him and the party's perception of him? (Note: His Warforged nature is now confirmed to the party. He experienced more visions hinting at his past, a 'copper city,' and a figure questioning 'Is she worth the cost?' He intends to research his origins.)
*   Who is the "higher up" individual Omen Knight Laser saw bearing the "Bone Crusher" emblem, and how does this connect to Leopold's past? (Note: Laser is now confirmed deceased.)
*   **How can the Fey Woman be restored from her petrified state? What is needed to counteract it?** *(New)*
*   **Where has Cedric fled with the Fey Woman's mask, and how can he be tracked (especially if he can turn invisible, as Kaladin suspects)?** *(New)*
*   **What are the properties and significance of The Reverend's transformed Stained-Glass Longsword now carried by Kaladin?** *(New)*

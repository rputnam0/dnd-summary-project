The air on the mountain grew thin and sharp, heavy with the metallic tang of cooling magma and the oppressive heat of a furnace. Far from the civil war consuming New New Arbor, the O’dears found themselves on a different kind of battlefield—a jagged, volcanic path on a mission of mercy for the animal-folk of Cottonwood. Before them, a river of lava hissed and spat, a stark reminder of the power they had come to confront. It was Kaladen who saw it first, a faint, rhythmic flickering against the dark rock face far up the path. A moment later, Cletus’s keen ears picked up the sound that went with it: the grim, organized tread of an army on the march.

Peering over a ridge, they saw the grim procession—not a mere raiding party, but a disciplined legion of over a hundred hyena-faced Gnolls, their torches a river of fire winding down the mountain, their destination unmistakable. Cottonwood. To fight them here was suicide. To let them pass was to condemn the village.

“We kill their master and then come back for them,” Kaladen declared, his voice a low whisper in their minds, his logic irrefutable. The plan was set: a decapitation strike.

With Zariel weaving a cloak of absolute silence around them with *Pass Without Trace* and Cyrus bolstering the party’s clumsiest members with arcane grace, they slipped past the marching horde like ghosts. Their new path led them across the lava stream, a crossing made trivial when Leopold, ever the pragmatist, conjured a shimmering rope from an unseen dimension for them to swing across. On the other side, a plateau of carved rock held a gruesome sight.

Chained to the stone wall was a creature that might have once been magnificent. Now, it was a broken, dying old bird-man, more crow than anything, with blood matting his tattered black feathers. The chains rattled as he shifted, a faint ember glowing deep within his eyes. “I reckon you don’t want to help this old crow with one last favor before he passes,” he rasped.

He was Elder Pyre-Tongue, the Apostle of the Flame, and the creature they sought was his lord—a benevolent spirit of the mountain, twisted and corrupted by a “cult of fanatics” led by one General Emory Razorback. The spirit’s flame, once a beacon of life, was now a curse of bloodshed. Pyre-Tongue did not ask them to spare his god. “I just ask that you engage,” he pleaded, a rattling cough shaking his frail body. “Do him justice.” With his last breath, he gave them the name of the general responsible, and then was silent. The party’s hunt had become a mercy killing.

At the mountain’s peak, they found it. The Fire Spirit was a colossal thing, sixty feet tall, perched in a massive, hodgepodge nest of whole trees and splintered houses. It was a pathetic sight, its feathers molting, its body wreathed in a sickly, low blue flame. The air of tragedy hung heavy, but there was no time for pity.

The assault was a coordinated explosion of chaos. From Kaladen’s hands, grasping vines erupted from the scorched nest, seeking to bind the creature. From Leopold, a cloud of shimmering motes—*Faerie Fire*—settled over the spirit, outlining it in an unholy purple light that promised no escape from their sight. From Cletus, two giant, spectral vultures swooped into the sky. And in the most spectacular display, Zariel reached out and reshaped reality, twisting Cyrus from a complaining farmhand into a monstrous Giant Ape, complete with lime-green fur and a comically oversized man-bun.

Cyrus, reborn as a primate of pure violence, roared with a new voice. “I fucking hate you, you fucking bird,” he bellowed into its mind, before charging. He grabbed the spirit, trying to wrestle its massive wings behind its back as if placing it under arrest. It was a profoundly stupid, gloriously brave act. And it was a mistake.

The spirit’s sickly blue flame detonated. With a soundless roar, it erupted into a being of pure, brilliant fire, a miniature sun of rage. The battle had truly begun.

The creature’s revenge was swift and terrible. It unleashed a torrent of flame from its beak, a jet of pure destruction like a Godzilla breath that carved a trench in the stone floor. Leopold’s loyal Steel Defender, Bone Crusher, was caught in the blast and exploded into a pressure-cooker bomb of slag and springs. Cletus was scorched, collapsing into a smoldering heap. The fight devolved into a desperate dance of survival. The giant ape, Cyrus, became the party’s anchor, absorbing blow after brutal blow while pummeling the spirit with fists the size of boulders. Kaladen, ever the artillery, stayed at a distance, launching searing arcs of light from his sword that shattered one of the spirit’s wings, while Leopold peppered it with bolts and magical stones.

Then, the beast turned on Leopold. A savage peck, and the warforged was down. Another, and he was on fire, his armor beginning to glow red. He failed a death save. As his companions frantically fought on, Leopold’s world went silent. With his life fading, the *All or Nothing Coin* tumbled from a slot in his chest, flipping end over end in the air. Time seemed to slow. It landed heads up. A surge of power jolted through him, and Leopold sat bolt upright with a single point of life, his armor a pancaked, smoldering ruin. "That was something," he grunted, just as another beak attack sent him crashing back into darkness.

This time, something different happened. As Zariel and the others frantically looted the gems from the creature’s nest, Leopold’s life truly began to slip away. As he failed another death save, the small porcelain doll at his waist grew warm, then burst into ash.

He was no longer on the battlefield. He was sitting in a vast, silent expanse, ash raining down from a lightless sky like snow. In the distance stood a cabin, perched impossibly atop a pair of colossal, twitching chicken legs. He walked toward it, the thud of his footfalls swallowed by the silence. As his knuckles rapped against the wooden door, the vision dissolved, pulling him back through the ashen void with a sickening lurch. He awoke with a gasp, his body still a wreck, staring at the dust of the doll in his hand. “Ho,” he managed, looking at his comrades. “What did I miss?”

The final moments of the fight were a blur of desperation. Zariel, now a Saber-Toothed Tiger, mauled at the beast while Cletus, revived by Cyrus, hammered it with beams of moonlight. The creature, wounded but still fighting, unleashed its fire breath one last time, engulfing Kaladen. The elf wizard endured the inferno and answered with a final, blinding flash from his Light Splitter. The arc of energy was perfect. It struck the spirit’s neck, and for a silent, beautiful moment, a thin white line of pure light was all that connected its head to its body. Then, the head slid free, and the colossal, flaming form collapsed into a mountain of ash and well-cooked poultry.

Silence descended, broken only by the panting of the survivors. As the great fire died, they saw the torches of the Gnoll army below flicker, break formation, and scatter into the forest. The threat was over.

Their return to Cottonwood was triumphant. Cornelius, the ancient Tortle, chuckled as they presented their collection of mangled Kobold “ear canals.” Though he saw through their ruse, he honored his deal. “I hope that you didn’t flay any family figures,” he mused, handing over their payment and two powerful artifacts: a gnarled, living staff for Cletus, and the wicked Guardian Death Cap Spear for Zariel.

That night, as the party prepared for a much-needed rest, Leopold shared his unsettling experience. “I’m not quite sure what I saw when I was out,” he said, his voice flat and analytical as he mended his smushed helmet, “but I think I may have found a way to the hag.” He paused, looking at his companions with his one good optical sensor. “Indeed, she seems to exist in the interdimensional space between life and death. So, all we have to do is kill somebody and, you know, edge him a little bit… and we can go have a chat.” The offer hung in the air, a chilling new quest born from the ashes of their victory.

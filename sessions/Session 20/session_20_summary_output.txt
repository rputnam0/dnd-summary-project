The sun rose over the Amberfields, painting the wheat in hues of gold, but on Cletus Cobbington’s farm, it was the delicate blossoms of almond trees that greeted the dawn. It was a life of routine, of lukewarm almond milk delivered by a strangely capable squirrel named Chip, and of berating his lanky, new farmhand, Cyrus Schwert. Cletus, a great, cow-like Firbolg bearing the Isoptic Curse that had twisted his form to match his affinity for nature, often wondered why he’d hired the boy. “Cyrus, don't you understand that Chip does more work than you in 15 minutes than you do in the whole day?” he’d grumble, knowing full well it was a favor to the boy’s father.

This peaceful, if exasperating, rhythm was shattered in the Market District. A panicked energy filled the air before a sound like fracturing glass ripped through the sky. The Arcane Splitter, a gate within the city’s shimmering dome, flickered and broke. A blood-curdling howl echoed through the streets as monstrous wolves swarmed into New New Arbor, turning the market into a scene of pure mayhem. Fleeing the chaos, Cletus and Cyrus were cornered, only to be saved by a hurried, half-orc Omen Knight with a familiar Irish lilt. “Go find my friends,” the knight, proud of his new rank and complaining of his “soft tissues,” commanded, pushing them through a shimmering portal.

They landed on soft moss in a forest far from home, a strange, comforting voice now echoing in their minds, drawing them toward a collection of ancient ruins. As they approached a weathered stone doorway, it swung open, and out stepped what looked like gods of war.

First came Kaladen, impossibly tall and elven, his armor glinting with red dragon scales and a prosthetic arm of living wood. He was followed by Leopold, a towering metal automaton whose joints hissed with steam, and his smaller, more lethal-looking Steel Defender. Finally, a third metallic figure emerged—Zariel, his form more like a sleek, iridescent war machine. The farmers tumbled backward, staring up at the seasoned O’dears.

“Anybody want some almond milk?” Cletus offered, breaking the stunned silence. Leopold, ever the curious machine, accepted, the milk promptly splashing into his open chest cavity and leaking through the cracks in his armor with the faint scent of old rotisserie chicken.

Skepticism warred with necessity. “It would seem to me that the odds of them just showing up here where we are would be astronomical,” Zariel noted privately to his comrades. Yet the tale the farmers told—of a city under siege and a rescue by their old friend Ratchet—was too specific to be a lie. For Cyrus, fear was eclipsed by awe. When Leopold welcomed them to the O’dears, the farmhand wept with joy. “I’m an adventurer now? I’m brave and strong! This is the best day of my life!”

Together, the new, unlikely fellowship stepped into the darkness of the second ruin, leaving Wesley and the parasite-infected Tucker to stand guard. An inscription greeted them: *Vault of the Wildfolk, trial chamber sequence, collect 10 keys to get the item.* The path forward was sealed by a door bearing a small metal spike. Zariel, recalling the bloody murals they’d seen before, knew what it required. One by one, they pricked their fingers—flesh, wood, and metal—and offered a single drop of blood, oil, or iridescent fluid to the slate, the wall shimmering into transparency for each of them. A pact, of a sort, had been made.

Their first trial came swiftly. A sticky, black cocoon burst open, releasing a monstrous, fly-like Chasme. Its buzzing drone tore through the air, a sound so dissonant it ripped the consciousness from Kaladen, sending him crumpling to the floor. As Zariel’s poison proved useless against the fiend, and Cyrus swung his plain scimitar with surprising ferocity, it was Cletus who proved their salvation, laying a hand on the fallen elf and murmuring a prayer. With a splash of what might have been almond milk, Kaladen’s eyes snapped open. The battle turned, and Leopold’s malfunctioning saber delivered an accidental, fatal thrust. As the creature dissolved, a smooth stone orb marked with a ‘V’ materialized on a pedestal. One key down.

Deciding to split up to cover more ground, Kaladen established a telepathic link between them all, a flower blooming near each of their ears. “Let us know when you need backup,” he thought to the others. “Fight well.”

Kaladen and Zariel faced another Chasme, its head lopped off by Kaladen’s Light Splitter, yielding the orb marked ‘I’. They then found another room, blessedly empty, containing the orb marked ‘II’.

Meanwhile, Leopold, Cletus, and Cyrus found themselves facing a creature of living shadow. Leopold’s elemental magic—ice and fire—sizzled ineffectually against its form. Cyrus’s scimitar, though non-magical, bit into the creature again and again, his slashes growing bolder with each swing. Finally, a desperate blast of fire from Leopold’s Steel Defender and a solid thwack from Cletus’s staff weakened it enough for Cyrus to land the killing blow, his sword now looking more like a melted butter knife. Their prize was the orb marked ‘VI’.

Their path led them to a chamber filled with ancient weapon racks and a statue of a knight, a Sylvan riddle on its plaque. With a brilliant flash of insight, Leopold scanned the racks and found a single, beautiful silvered longsword. Upon its blade, a name: *Peacemaker*. He placed it in the statue’s hand, which closed around the hilt. A hidden door ground open, revealing their next key: ‘IX’.

The groups reconvened before a door bristling with seven locks, each inscribed in a different tongue. As Kaladen began the ritual to comprehend the languages, Leopold vanished into Zariel’s extradimensional toolbox, emerging moments later with a masterfully crafted set of thieves’ tools. All eyes turned to Cyrus. Guided by Cletus’s prayers and the entire party’s backseat-driving, the farmhand-turned-adventurer stepped forward. With a series of impossibly deft clicks, he defeated all seven locks, revealing the orb marked ‘IV’.

Their triumph was short-lived. Splitting once more, they walked into two separate ambushes. Cletus, Cyrus, and Leopold were beset by a pair of fiendish Quasits, which they dispatched with brutal efficiency, earning them the orb marked ‘VIII’. But for Kaladen and Zariel, the threat was far greater.

A hulking, vulture-like demon—a Vrock—dropped from the ceiling. Before they could react, it unleashed a horrific, guttural screech. Kaladen failed to resist, his mind seizing, stunned and helpless. The Vrock descended upon him, its beak and talons a blur of vicious strikes. A critical blow sent a staggering forty-eight points of damage surging through the wizard, leaving him on the verge of death.

As Kaladen swayed, Zariel, shaking off the stun’s effects, acted. A spectral, healing spirit shimmered into existence beside his friend, mending his wounds. Then, Zariel’s form buckled and reformed, his organic shell giving way to the metallic behemoth of his true Warforged shape—a great, gleaming bear. The bear charged, its claws gouging deep into the demon’s hide. Even as Kaladen used a surge of will to cast a shield of mirror images and gulp down a potion, the Vrock hammered at him relentlessly. The fight became a desperate dance of healing and damage, until Zariel, roaring in fury, grabbed the demon’s leathery wings and, with a final, terrible heave, ripped them from its body.

As black ichor sprayed the chamber, Leopold, Cletus, and Cyrus came sprinting into the room, having heard the sounds of the struggle. “I’m here! I’m here!” Leopold yelled, arriving just in time to see the Vrock fall, before he collapsed stiffly onto the floor like a felled tree.

In the quiet aftermath, Cletus, ever the animal lover, cautiously approached the metallic bear, reaching out to soothe what he perceived as a gentle creature. *“Hey, get off me, dude,”* came Zariel’s voice in his mind, just as the bear dissolved back into the Warforged druid, leaving Cletus with a confused handful of thigh.

There was no key in this room, no prize for their hardest-won victory. But they were alive. They were together. They now held seven of the ten keys. Standing in the blood and ichor, their strange new alliance forged in the crucible of the Vault, they looked to the next dark doorway, ready for whatever lay beyond.

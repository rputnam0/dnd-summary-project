*   **Selena Sal:** Eccentric, seemingly ancient potion shop owner (Storm District). Huge goggles, messy bun, patchwork muumuu. Potentially senile or feigning it. Has a talking hermit crab, Marcel. Her shop contains the hidden entrance to the Fungal Tunnels, which are now known to be extensive, dangerous, and connected to Fey magic and transformations. Her involvement/awareness remains unknown.
*   **Lancex the Fungal Guardian:** *(New Key NPC)* Former Stonewall Legionnaire assimilated and mutated into a powerful Myconid Sovereign variant. Encountered as the guardian of the final chamber in the Fungal Tunnels.

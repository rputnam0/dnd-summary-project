Conducted Zariel's post-mission briefing: Used silence and indirect questioning.

Possesses significant magical power, subtly intervening in pit fights to heal/buff combatants (Alara, Rurik) with flashes of golden light. After the party defeated three opponents, he complimented their performance, dropped into the pit, and issued a direct challenge to them.

## Ongoing Mysteries & Goals

*   What is the full nature, origin, and range of effects of the Isoptic Curse? (Note: Stress Point activation observed - Zariel used 2 more, total 3 used; Leopold 1 used; Kaladin 1 used. Thurr testing recruits. Metallic sheen seen on Zariel. Cost/drawbacks still unknown.)

What did his dream signify? (Note: Memory flash confirmed past potion-making link. **New memory flash connected pit fighting to "blood pits," his father, and brother "Victor" getting promoted to "captain."** Felt recognition with Blackguard Knight. Library research yielded little.)

Researched Feywild history. Experienced vision connecting him to woman. Still feels strong connection to fey woman's mask. Had disturbing dream.)

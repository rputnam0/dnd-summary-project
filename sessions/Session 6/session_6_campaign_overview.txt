Possesses significant magical power, subtly intervening in pit fights to heal/buff combatants (Alara, Rurik) with flashes of golden light. After the party defeated three opponents, he complimented their performance, dropped into the pit, and issued a direct challenge to them.

## Ongoing Mysteries & Goals

*   What is the full nature, origin, and range of effects of the Isoptic Curse? (Note: Stress Point activation observed - Zariel used 2 more, total 3 used; Leopold 1 used; Kaladin 1 used. Thurr testing recruits. Metallic sheen seen on Zariel. Cost/drawbacks still unknown.)
*   What are the details surrounding Zariel's memory loss and 'accident'? What is the significance of his dream of stasis/medical care? (Note: Metallic sheen. Legionnaire medical facility felt "somewhat familiar". Repeated near-death experiences in pit fight may add trauma.)
*   What happened during Leopold's past (deactivation, memory issues)? What is the story behind his "Bone Grinder" emblem? Was his brother truly an Omen Knight named Victor? What did his dream signify? (Note: Memory flash confirmed past potion-making link. **New memory flash connected pit fighting to "blood pits," his father, and brother "Victor" getting promoted to "captain."** Felt recognition with Blackguard Knight. Library research yielded little.)
*   What were Kaladin's specific dreams motivating him? What is the nature of his connection to the Feywild/past lives hinted at in dreams/vision? (Note: Potent Fey magic discovered. Researched Feywild history. Experienced vision connecting him to woman. Still feels strong connection to fey woman's mask. Had disturbing dream.)

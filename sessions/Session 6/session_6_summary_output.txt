The air hung thick and stale in the Spit and Swallow, a fug of cheap ale, sweat, and something vaguely metallic clinging to the back of the throat. It was a far cry from the sterile corridors of Legionnaire HQ, this grimy, sawdust-strewn dive nestled in the rough-and-tumble loading docks of New New Arbor's Market District. Torn posters clung precariously to walls scarred by countless brawls, the din of raucous laughter and a surprisingly lively fiddle threatening to overwhelm the senses. But beneath the veneer of blue-collar revelry, the newly minted Legionnaires – Kaladin Shash, Leopold Magnus, and Zariel Torgan, collectively, if accidentally, dubbed ‘The O’Dears’ – sensed something else. They were hunting whispers, chasing the shadow of the “Hand of God,” the extremist cult whose bloody debut had stained the recent festival. Ratshit, their cynical handler, had pointed them here, to this den of fighters and lowlifes, their only lead in a city still reeling from chaos.

Their polished Legionnaire gear marked them instantly, drawing stares that ranged from curious to openly hostile. Leopold, ever the conspicuous automaton, craned his metallic neck, scanning the throng. His optical sensors, designed for precision, cut through the haze, past the jeering crowd surrounding the central sand pit where two patrons were currently engaged in clumsy fisticuffs. And there, leaning against the far wall, observing with unnerving intensity, was a man. Large, powerfully built, not with the lean definition of a honed warrior, but the sheer bulk of a pugilist. And hanging from his waist, catching the dim light, was an iron symbol: a right hand, palm out, fingers curled just so, like one might cradle a frisbee. The mark of the Hand.

“Why, fellas,” Leopold announced, his voice cutting through the din, oblivious to the dozen heads that swiveled towards him, “I think we might have to ask *that* gentleman some questions.” He pointed, a large metallic finger singling out their quarry across the crowded room.

“Stop pointing!” Kaladin hissed, trying to melt into the shadows that weren’t there. “Subtlety, Leopold!”

“What are you going on about?” Leopold replied, genuinely perplexed. “I’m ascertaining the direction that we must flow.”

Their attempt at a direct approach was met with swift resistance. Burly figures materialized from the crowd, blocking their path. Kaladin found a meaty hand pressed against his chest. “I don’t think so, bud,” the bouncer growled, a man whose sheer size hinted at Goliath ancestry. “You don’t get to just talk to Cedric. Nobody speaks to the champ who hasn’t earned it.” Simultaneously, Zariel felt the cold kiss of steel against his throat, a sharp dagger held by a woman with predatory eyes. “Now, I don’t remember inviting you to our box,” she purred. The message was clear: access to Cedric, the Hand-marked champion, came at a price, paid in the blood and sand of the fighting pit.

Retreating to the relative safety of the bar, they conferred with Ollie, the squat, bearded bartender who spoke in a rough whisper. He confirmed the tavern’s brutal tradition: win a fight, earn the *chance* to challenge the champ. It was a gamble, but their only path forward. Zariel, ever the pragmatist, hatched a plan. "We give you a really lame name," he suggested, eyeing Leopold, "like Brokey McBroke Robot... maybe a limp out there... And then we bet big. See?"

And so, "Grandpa Bot" shuffled towards the pit, Leopold doing his best impression of decrepitude, though his performance earned more confused silence than pity. His opponent: Alara the Serpent, the very woman who’d held Zariel at knifepoint. Kaladin, discreetly weaving arcane energies, blessed his comrades as the fight began. Alara, fast and vicious, darted in, her dagger flashing. Leopold, despite his act, reacted with mechanical precision, his integrated shield flaring to deflect blows that would have crippled a lesser combatant. He summoned his Steel Defender, only to have the crowd boo his perceived cowardice, forcing him to rely on his own capabilities. Tactical spellcasting became his shield and sword – a slick patch of Grease sent Alara sprawling, bolts from his hand crossbow found their mark, and a well-aimed Fire Bolt turned the Grease into an inferno. Yet, Alara pressed on, aided by a subtle flash of golden light from Cedric's direction, a fleeting heal noticed only by Zariel. Leopold endured painful stabs, his armor groaning, but eventually, a final crossbow bolt sent Alara slumping into the sand. Amidst the scattered cheers of those who'd won bets, Leopold staggered back, uttering words that hinted at a fractured past: "Reminds me of the blood pits... Father... when Victor got promoted to captain..."

Next came Zariel, stepping into the pit as the announcer called out the absurd moniker, “Tuberculosis Jim!” His opponent: Rurik the Iron Fist, a known brawler whose arrival sparked murmurs of anticipation. The fight that followed was a testament to sheer, bloody-minded endurance. Zariel exploded into his Dire Wolf form, snapping and tearing at Rurik, who met the ferocity with brutal efficiency and blatant cheating. A hidden blade flashed alongside his fists, and again and again, Rurik hammered Zariel with stunning strikes, rocking the druid’s formidable wolf form. Cedric intervened again, bathing Rurik in a golden aura of power. Zariel was forced back into his elven shape, bleeding, stunned, only to surge back into the wolf. He took blow after savage blow, his vision blurring, the crowd a distant roar. Twice, he felt the pull of oblivion, the cold darkness beckoning, only to wrench himself back with sheer will, drawing on the strange power within – the Stress Points burning like hot coals in his soul. He clung to consciousness by a thread, his healing magic a desperate whisper. A Nat 20 death save saw him stagger back to his feet with a single point of life, the crowd aghast. He conjured a blade of pure flame, then a whip of thorns, finally dragging the cheating Iron Fist down after a grueling, near-fatal exchange that left Zariel utterly spent. As his victorious comrades gathered their winnings, Zariel tried to find a corner to rest, only to collapse unconscious, the toll of his ordeal finally claiming him. Leopold, ever the caretaker, rushed over, attempting resuscitation with a mug of ale.

It fell to Kaladin to face the final challenger: Thrag "The Boulder," the massive bouncer who'd first blocked his path. Kaladin, the scholar, the wizard, stepped into the pit not with brute force, but with arcane preparation. Shimmering duplicates flickered around him as Mirror Image sprang into existence. His first gambit, a costly Scroll of Fireball, fizzled uselessly as Thrag snatched it from his grasp mid-incantation. The giant pressed the attack, his spiked knuckles battering Kaladin’s magical defenses. Shield spells flared, absorbing bone-jarring impacts. Twice, Thrag’s blows disarmed the elf, sending his spear clattering to the sand, forcing Kaladin to rely on close-range cantrips – Crackling Shocking Grasps that momentarily halted the brute, and darts of pure force from Magic Missile that chipped away at his endurance. Kaladin retrieved his weapon each time, refusing to yield. Finally, seeing an opening, Kaladin unleashed the slumbering spores woven into his spear-staff. The first attempt failed, Thrag shaking off the magical drowsiness. But the second, fueled by desperation, took hold. Thrag’s eyes glazed over, his massive frame swaying before collapsing into the sand. Kaladin didn’t hesitate. Locking eyes with Cedric across the pit, he advanced on the sleeping form. His quarterstaff telescoped, transforming into a sleek, deadly spear. With calculated precision, he thrust downwards, ending the fight decisively.

A tense silence fell, broken only by the sputtering torchlight and the ragged breathing of the combatants. Then, Cedric stood. The champion, the man bearing the Hand of God, pushed away from the wall. He walked to the edge of the pit, his expression unreadable. "Well," he drawled, his voice surprisingly calm, "that was pretty interesting, actually." He hopped down into the sand, landing softly despite his bulk. "Mind if I jump in?"

Before the weary Legionnaires could fully process the challenge, Cedric flexed. Not a simple tightening of muscle, but an explosion of raw power. The very ground beneath them trembled. An oppressive force washed over them, a palpable wave of energy that simultaneously crushed and invigorated. They felt their wounds seal, their exhaustion evaporate, their magical reserves replenish. More than that, they felt a fundamental shift, a surge of potential unlocking within them – the power of experience, instantly granted. They stood revitalized, leveled up, facing the Hand of God’s champion, whose true, terrifying power had just been undeniably revealed. The real fight, it seemed, was only just beginning.

A ceaseless, silent fall of ash and snow painted the world in monochrome. Here, in the desolate Ashen Grove, at the foot of a tree so vast it scarred the sky, the O’dears found themselves. Their recent escape from the drowned city of Moonhaven felt a lifetime away, its tropical humidity replaced by a biting cold that promised only an ending. Their goal was singular: to reach the eternally burning Tree of Death and enact the cryptic prophecy that had entwined itself around Kaladen’s very soul.

For a brief time, they found sanctuary within the magical willow summoned by Cletus’s staff, its rustling leaves a gentle defiance against the oppressive silence. Zariel, ever the provider, conjured a grand Hero’s Feast, a final bastion of warmth and courage against the trials ahead. The meal fortified their bodies and, more importantly, their minds, granting them a bulwark against the fear that permeated this dead land. Yet, peace here was a fleeting illusion. Venturing out from the dome’s protection, Zariel took to the sky as an Air Elemental, only to be met by a sight torn from a fever dream: a ramshackle hut, lurching through the skeletal trees on colossal chicken legs. As he drew near, a wave of primordial power washed over him, a force so ancient and absolute it ripped the magic from his form, sending him plummeting back to the ash-covered earth. The hut settled nearby, its presence a silent, unavoidable invitation.

Fear, they say, is a poor advisor, but curiosity can be a powerful motivator. With Cyrus Schwert leading the way, his usual swagger tempered by a healthy dose of dread, the party approached. The instant his knuckles touched the crooked wooden door, it swung open, spilling a wave of impossible scents into the cold air: cinnamon and clove, burning hair and iron, blood and herbs. The floorboards inside did not creak; they sobbed under their weight. This was a place of domestic horror, of throw rugs and pickled feet, of mummified imps hanging like dried lavender, and of runes scrawled in ancient, faded blood.

From the shadows, a figure turned. Eight feet tall even with a severe hunch, with spindly, elongated limbs and a face of wrinkles so deep they resembled the folds of a brain, she was a being outside of mortal definition. Her form shifted in the firelight, wavering between masculine and feminine, ancient and ageless. She was the Baba Yaga.

“It is… happened that we meet on this day, don’t you think?” her voice rasped, a harmony of two octaves, one deep, one shrill. She already knew their questions, their fears, their deepest secrets. A negotiation began, not of gold or steel, but of essence. Cyrus, after a comically absurd offer of his soiled spider-silk pillow was politely declined, watched as Zariel stepped forward. The Warforged Druid, ever the pragmatist, made an offer that stunned the ancient hag into a wide, black-toothed grin. “Why don’t you swap me into a different dude,” Zariel proposed, “and then you can just have the metal body and you can do what you want with it?”

The price was set. For the unique novelty of an artificial soul, the Baba Yaga would unravel the tapestry of their lives. In a flash of horrific speed, her hand plunged through Zariel’s chest, ripping his glowing artificial core from its housing. She crushed it over her cauldron as his metal form crumpled to the ground. “We’ll come back to that,” she cackled, turning her attention to the horrified party.

What followed was a flood of revelations that rewrote their history. The Cursed King Tentherian, the architect of a centuries-old war, was indeed Kaladen’s ancient fey relative. But the Isoptric Curse that had defined their lives? That was the hag’s own handiwork. “He might take credit for it,” she sneered, “but reality is… the curse was mine. I enjoy it daily.” She revealed Tentherian’s grand design: a desperate, centuries-long plan to gather multiple candidates to fulfill the prophecy of the Fae King. Kaladen was the true heir, the last of his royal bloodline. Zariel was the backup, an “artificial fey” built as a failsafe. Cletus and Cyrus were “twin souls,” another potential path to the throne.

Then, her gaze fell upon Leopold. With an aggressive dusting from a magical ostrich feather, she cleared the cobwebs from his mind, and his past came crashing back. He saw himself not as a machine, but as an elf with fiery red hair. He remembered his violent brother, Victor Bonecrusher. He relived the abusive training under the cruel hand of Lord Calmera Windrider, a man who had adopted them only to hone them as weapons. He remembered his own death, and then the horrific necromantic ritual where Calmera, meaning to place Victor’s soul into the ultimate war machine, had made a mistake. Leopold, the gentle magic-user, had been placed into the body of the Bone Crusher by accident. He was a stolen soul in the wrong body.

Kaladen, in turn, learned why the prophecy mattered. The Feywild was dying, its life force siphoned for a thousand years to power the very domes that sheltered their people. Only a new king, crowned with the power of the Twilight Weave, could restore it. For the price of his pinky finger, ripped from his hand in a blink, he learned more: the Twilight Weave was the key to uniting the fey courts and reversing the flow of magic. In the Feywild, the warrior Fae Lara—the very woman from the mask—was alive and preparing for their arrival.

With the truths laid bare, the hag returned to her cauldron. From the bubbling depths, she pulled a new form, raw and steaming. A hulking, green-skinned body with obsidian tusks and a familiar, self-conscious baldness. Zariel, retaining every memory, every ounce of his power, was reborn as a Half-Orc. As his reward for the bargain, he chose a grotesque but powerful Cloak of Displacement, a patchwork of five halfling skins that would now protect his new, vulnerable flesh.

Their business concluded, the party was unceremoniously ejected as the hut simply walked away, leaving no trace it had ever been there. They were left to face the next trial: the Emberwake Crossing, a massive, treacherous root bridging a chasm of swirling mist. As they crossed, spectral forms materialized, their only purpose to shove the heroes to their doom. Leopold, his balance failing him, tumbled over the edge not once, but twice. The first time, he was snatched from a fatal plummet by the crackling lash of Kaladen’s *Lightning Lure*. The second, as both he and Cletus slipped, Cyrus burned a point of his own inner power, casting a spell that imbued them both with a cat’s grace, allowing them to find purchase at the last possible second.

They had survived the crossing, their bonds forged anew in shared sacrifice and frantic heroism. Now they stood within the Cindered Cradle, a chamber of eternally burning roots at the heart of the great tree. Before them, a creature of charred wood and hellfire, the Cindered Guardian, unfurled itself from the wall. It set its feet, raised its massive iron cleaver, and let out a roar like the grinding of ancient stones. The past had been revealed, but the future, it seemed, would have to be won.

A city of ghosts held its breath, but Zariel Torgan, the steel-skinned druid, had only one thing on his mind: a hat. While the O’dears recovered from their harrowing delve into Moonhaven’s Core Tower, Zariel’s gaze remained fixed on the submerged Larendel district and a rumored haberdashery. Convincing the ever-curious Leopold to join him, the two automatons descended into the silent, water-filled streets, their heavy forms sinking to the algae-kissed cobblestone. They found their prize in Pat’s Haberdashery, a decrepit, sunken treasure trove. Leopold claimed a surprisingly well-maintained, non-magical top hat, while Zariel discovered the *Counter’s Charm*, an ostentatious tricorn with a purplish feather and bedazzled gems. As he placed it on his metallic head, it resized perfectly.

“So instead of like a fuckboy, I’m like a fuckbot,” Zariel mused, admiring his reflection. Leopold looked on, feeling a strange, inexplicable sense that his companion now looked both dashing and profoundly douchey.

Their triumphant return, however, was cut short. As they jogged back through the city’s upper tiers, a silent pressure descended upon them. It was not hostile, not yet, but it was absolute. An unseen puppeteer pulled their strings, and the two warforged, their own wills momentarily snuffed out, veered from the path and marched into a vast, overgrown amphitheater, their new hats glinting in the hazy light.

Above, the rest of the party’s patience had worn thin. “They’re probably just waiting so long to pick the right hat,” Kaladen grumbled, but a seed of worry had been planted. The wizard strained his fey-touched senses, reaching for their telepathic bond, only to find a pressurized, unsettling silence on the other end. It was Cletus who found the solution. Stamping his staff of woven woodlands, the Firbolg cast *Locate Plants*, his magic seeking out the fey-touched flowers and sprigs of wheat his companions carried. A glowing trail, visible only to him, illuminated a path through the trees. “There!” he pointed with the certainty of a hunting dog, and the rescue party was off.

They arrived on a high ledge overlooking the amphitheater to a scene of quiet horror. Below, Leopold and Zariel stood frozen, their eyes vacant. And between them and the party, a creature that seemed to flicker into existence, a thing their minds had previously been forbidden from seeing. It was a False Hydra. A long, scaly black serpent’s body moved on two stocky legs, its torso splitting into five monstrously elongated elven necks, each ending in a frozen, screaming face of stone-like flesh.

With no time for words, Kaladen initiated the assault. A bead of fire erupted from his hand, engulfing the beast in a silent explosion as Cletus called down a searing column of moonlight. The creature shrieked, but not in pain. One of its heads unleashed a mind-shattering song, and for Cyrus, the world went blank. The monster, the danger, his friends’ peril—all of it was simply erased from his memory. As the young bard stood dumbfounded, the Hydra struck, its maws snapping shut around Zariel and Leopold, swallowing them whole.

The sight of his friends being consumed shattered the Hydra’s mental prison. Cyrus’s mind roared back to life, white-hot rage supplanting confusion. “My whole body starts glowing with white hot light,” he would later recount, “and it extends into my sword as I fucking slice through this thing like a knife going through hot butter!” He launched himself from the ledge, a blur of righteous fury. His enchanted blade, fueled by two divine smites, carved an arc of devastation, shearing two of the creature’s heads clean off in a single, fluid motion. The swordsman landed in a perfect superhero pose, looking over his shoulder to ensure his brilliance was witnessed. The shock of the hundred-and-eleven-point assault was too much for the beast; with a retch, it vomited the slime-covered Leopold back onto the amphitheater floor.

From within the monster’s gullet, Zariel chose a different tactic. With a flare of grim determination, he ignited, his physical body erupting into a roaring Fire Elemental. An internal inferno began to cook the beast from the inside out. Kaladen, action surging, rained down radiant slashes from his Light Splitter, hacking off another head. Yet the Hydra was not done. Reeling and wreathed in internal flame, it unleashed a dreadful, psychic scream that washed over the arena. Kaladen, Cletus, and Cyrus buckled, their minds assaulted, their bodies locked in a stunned paralysis. The monster seized the moment, its remaining heads savaging the downed Leopold until he fell unconscious.

But the O’dears are nothing if not persistent. As the beast attempted to flee, Kaladen and Cletus, shaking off the stun, took their final shots. The wizard’s blade and the druid’s staff struck true, and the grotesque amalgamation of Moonhaven’s former council collapsed into a heap of twitching flesh and severed necks.

In the ringing silence that followed, Zariel, reverting to his true form, became a beacon of life. Waves of healing magic washed over his broken friends, knitting wounds and bringing Leopold back from the brink. As they caught their breath, Cletus turned to the local flora. He fed a patch of ivy a bit of nutritious almond-laced soil and, through his magic, struck up a conversation. The vine, a gruff, poison-ivy mobster named Ricky, was impressed. “Yeah, maybe I’ve seen some teleportation circles,” he rasped. “You just let them know Ricky sent you.”

Ricky’s directions led them not to the obvious stone circles in the nearby cathedral, but to a place only Kaladen’s fey senses could find. While the others examined the defunct portals—including one to “Isoptra” that had been deliberately smashed to pieces—the wizard felt a pull toward a gnarled, ancient tree built into the very wall of the building. Carved into its trunk was an archway of dormant runes, the true portal. Working together, the party disabled a hidden anti-magic ward and channeled their power into the tree. The runes flared to life, the ancient bark split down an invisible seam, and a blast of frigid, snow-laced air swept over them.

One by one, the O’dears stepped through, leaving the haunted beauty of Moonhaven behind. They emerged onto a narrow ledge overlooking a desolate, bowl-shaped basin. The landscape before them was a study in death. An impossibly tall, slate-gray tree, the Tree of Death itself, dominated the horizon, its canopy merging with the low, gray clouds. From it, a ceaseless fall of fine gray ash dusted a land of dead, gnarled forests. The air was cold, carrying a metallic tang that clung to the tongue. At their feet was a collapsed cabin, an old map inside labeling their location as the “Ashen Watch.” Ahead lay the Emberwake Crossing, the Hollow of Black Roots, and, glowing with a dull orange light from the heart of the great tree, a place called the Cradle of Cinders. The next stage of their journey had begun.

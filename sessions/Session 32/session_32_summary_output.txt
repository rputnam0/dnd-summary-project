The echoes of their climactic battle against the Spider Queen still ringing in their ears, the O’dears found themselves in a place far older and deeper than the arachnid’s lair. They stood within an ancient Elven service tunnel, its elegant arches now draped in thick, cloying webbing. The air was heavy, but a new sound dominated the silence: the deep, deafening roar of rushing water somewhere ahead in the oppressive dark. Survival had given way to a new, immediate mystery.

Their mission was to discover the source of Moonhaven’s unnatural flood, and it seemed they were approaching its very heart. As they ventured forward, the tunnel ended abruptly at a sight of pure, chaotic power. A ten-foot-wide intersection was entirely consumed by a torrent of water moving with the force of a fireman’s hose, a horizontal waterfall blasting into an unseen abyss. It was, as Kaladen noted with a grimace, a drain. A planetary one.

While the party debated their next move, Cyrus, ever the pragmatist in his own unique way, decided to prepare for a rest. He pushed together a mass of the surrounding webbing, which squished with a sound both gross and wet. “It does not feel comfortable,” he muttered, laying his head down on a makeshift pillow of what could only be described as grotesque, milky webbing, “but I can’t sleep without a pillow.” His companions looked on in a mixture of horror and begrudging respect.

The path forward was impassable for any normal being. It was a challenge met by Zariel, who gifted his legendary cloak, the Embered Mane, to Cletus. "I think you might use this a little better than me," he offered, a selfless, tactical decision to bolster his friend’s power. Then, Zariel’s form dissolved into a churning vortex of liquid, reforming as a powerful Water Elemental. He plunged into the current, ferrying a trusting Leopold within his fluid body to scout ahead. But the pull was too great; Zariel felt his form shredding as he was yanked helplessly through a shimmering portal at the water’s destination.

As the others waited in tense silence, their resident elemental now lost to an unknown plane, Cyrus’s keen eye spotted something amiss—a moss-covered console near a wall, with the skeletal remains of some long-dead guardian reaching for it. Kaladen stepped forward and brushed a hand against a single, throbbing orange rune. The air went still as the console projected a silent, ghostly recording of a forgotten battle. They watched as a colossal, shadowy invader cut down soldier after soldier, only to be met by two defiant figures: a tall elf and a proud dragonborn. It was Cletus’s sharp perception that caught the subtle truth; the defenders were not merely defiant, they were bait. With subtle gestures, the elf wove a spell upon the well behind them while the dragonborn summoned the very torrent of water that now plagued the city. The trap was sprung. The invader, caught in the deluge, was banished through the portal they now faced—a heroic, desperate act that had cost the city its lifeblood.

Just as the recording faded, Zariel burst back through the portal, thrown clear by a masterfully cast Rope Trick from Leopold. “I didn't like it over there,” the elemental rumbled telepathically. “It's cold. Empty, black, light-bendy light.” He had been to the Astral Sea, and he had not been alone.

The task was now clear. The trap had to be undone. It was Leopold who saw the path forward. "I have the blueprints for the Arcane Splitter," he announced, his mind racing. "I think I can create a very narrow magical beam... like a little scalpel to try and extract that." Rallying around him, the party poured their strength into the artificer. Cletus offered guidance, Cyrus bestowed him with enhanced intellect, and Kaladen shared his own failed attempt’s insights. With a final, focused effort, Leopold unleashed a hyper-beam of blue energy from his fingertip, a plasma scalpel of pure intellect that sliced through the ancient magic. The golden runes sputtered and died. The roar of the water ceased, and with a final, violent splash, the flow reversed, the Wellspring’s seal finally broken.

In the sudden quiet, the chamber changed. Faint, blue sprites of magic, like ethereal ashes, began to rise from the now-dormant well. The Wellspring was reawakening. The party felt its gentle touch heal their wounds. Cletus, with a spark of druidic ingenuity, dipped a handful of almonds into the nascent magic, creating a pouch of enchanted, healing nuts. But for Kaladen, the moment was monumental. As he scooped the fluid essence into his hands and drank, he felt a profound click deep within his soul. The prophecy was real, and this was the first step. He bottled the swirling blue mana, a tangible piece of his newfound destiny. Zariel, too, felt the pull, and as he dipped his form into the well, his chest opened, absorbing the raw planetary magic with a sense of homecoming. His body, he realized, was *made* to do this.

Their objective complete, the O’dears swam back through the now-calm tunnels, emerging into the breathtaking vista of the ruined city. Light filtered down through hundreds of feet of water, illuminating the grand, submerged Alerian district. They pulled themselves onto a stone path overgrown with Alar trees. Cletus pointed towards a sign for the town center, a clear path to their final goal.

And then the world skipped.

One moment, they were dripping wet, the midday light sparkling around them. The next, their clothes were bone dry, the sky was a black velvet blanket strewn with stars, and the water level had dropped by an impossible hundred feet. Six hours of their lives, vanished from memory. They had simply been standing there, unaware, as the world moved on without them. A deep, chilling unease settled over the party. They had won, but they were not alone.

Choosing to rest and face the coming day with full strength, they settled in. Cletus attuned to his new, fiery cloak. Cyrus dozed off, dreaming of his grotesque pillow. But Leopold, forgoing sleep, worked through the night on his armor upgrades, willingly taking the exhaustion. And in the quiet hours before dawn, at the periphery of his vision, a figure took shape—a ghostly, ethereal apparition of his Steel Defender, Bone Crusher. It was silent, wispy, and when Leopold commanded it to kneel, it obeyed without question, a spectral servant born from his own mysterious power, watching him work in the unsettling stillness of the dead city.

Ah, gather ‘round, adventurers, and let this old storyteller spin a yarn from the annals of New New Arbor, a tale soaked in arcane energy, sudden violence, and the burgeoning, often clumsy, heroism of our newest Legionnaires – the… well, they’re still working on the name.

Our chronicle resumes not long after their harrowing foray into the fungal depths. Having delivered the final, crucial component – an arcane gem pulsating with borrowed library magic – to the ever-gruff Hamhawk, the Ogre-like smith of the Stonewall Legionnaires, the Arcane Splitter stood complete. “Oh fucking great. I was waiting on this,” Hamhawk grunted, snatching the gem and tinkering briefly before declaring the dangerous device operational. Leopold Magnus, the earnest Warforged, stood saluting stiffly, enduring Hamhawk’s continued refusal to acknowledge his self-proclaimed apprenticeship. "Not. No. No. Please stop," she’d sighed, waving them away, "This is getting you nowhere." Before shooing them out, she added, "Ratshit is looking for you. He's got something else for you."

The weight of their other discovery, the enigmatic woman slumbering under a mask of living fey magic, pressed heavily upon them. Kaladen Shash, the high-elf wizard whose dreams echoed with the Feywild, voiced the group’s uneasy consensus: their limited knowledge was a dead end. They decided, not without trepidation, to entrust her to the Legionnaires, but on their terms.

Seeking out their handler, the wiry half-orc known as Ratshit, they found him amidst administrative chaos. He confirmed Hamhawk's message, handing Kaladen a file marked "Assignment: Watchdog." Minimal risk, it claimed. Observe an upcoming festival, watch for extremists rumored to be stirring in the downtrodden Dawn District. Before they could broach the subject of the woman, Kaladen requested an audience with the leadership. Ratshit directed them towards Lord Marshall Thurr, who was concluding a briefing.

In a large meeting room, the imposing Lord Marshall addressed a cadre of elite Omen Knights – slick, geared, radiating confidence – and the party. He detailed the upcoming mission: the Omen Knights, dubbed “SEAL Team 6.5,” would venture through a temporary opening in the Arcane Dome, created by Hamhawk’s newly finished Splitter, to investigate the silent northern city of Moonhaven. It would be the first expedition outside in decades, celebrated with a public festival – a spectacle designed, perhaps, to distract from the inherent risks. The party’s role? Keep an eye on the crowds for the nascent Dawn District troublemakers.

As the meeting concluded, Kaladen approached Thurr. With Zariel Torgan, the quiet druid, lending subtle magical aid, Kaladen made his plea regarding the fey woman. “Perhaps you can help her more than we can,” he proposed, “But we just want a sign of good faith. Can we be there as you assist her?” A ripple of arcane power, a moment of genuine connection – Kaladen’s earnestness, amplified by Zariel’s Guidance, struck true. A Natural 20 on persuasion. Thurr’s stern features softened. "Of course," the Lord Marshall conceded, visibly pleased by their choice. "I'm just glad you came to this decision on your own."

He led them deep into the Legionnaire headquarters, down via a rune-activated elevator to a sterile, white medical sub-level bustling with clerics and advanced tech. To Zariel, the place sparked a disconcerting flicker of familiarity, a ghost of a memory he couldn’t grasp. Thurr revealed a room already prepared, infused with druidic plants and subtle green magics. "I've never seen this kind of magic where this is mask," Thurr admitted truthfully, gesturing to the specialized chamber, "But I'm keen to learn." He granted them access runes, etched directly onto their armor (or, in Leopold’s case, his shield mount), sealing their pact of cautious trust before departing with a weary sigh about the impending "disaster of an event." The party retrieved the woman, settling her into the strange, yet somehow fitting, room. Her state remained unchanged, Kaladen still feeling the undeniable pull of her mask, while Zariel felt an odd, faint *something* stir within his core in her presence.

Days later, the festival erupted in the Market District. Hundreds thronged the streets – performers juggled, children shrieked with laughter, vendors hawked their wares. Our heroes took their post atop a designated rooftop, overlooking the cordoned-off stage near the Dome’s shimmering edge. The air hummed with forced gaiety and underlying tension. After interminable speeches by local dignitaries, Lord Marshall Thurr took the stage, his massive frame clad in formal wear. He announced the Moonhaven mission, the crowd cheering, then booing at the mention of unknown risks. "Bring out the splitter!" Thurr commanded.

The device pulsed. With a surge of energy and a thrum that vibrated through the very cobblestones, the Arcane Splitter sheared open the Dome, creating a triangular passage into the world beyond. The Omen Knights, icons for a moment, waved to the crowd and stepped through. But the cheers died in throats as the world outside was revealed: dreary, dark, lashed by wind, rain, and hail simultaneously. A hostile wasteland. And then, disaster. Leopold’s keen eyes, followed swiftly by Zariel’s and Kaladen’s, spotted it first – a hulking shape in the gloom, yellow eyes flashing. An enormous, monstrous wolf-like creature lunged from the shadows, falling upon the unprepared Omen Knights.

“Watch out!” Leopold cried into the comms. Zariel reacted instantly, shouting a warning to command while simultaneously summoning an iridescent pigeon-spirit that swooped towards the stage, squawking frantically. Chaos erupted. Initiative crackled through the air.

Leopold, screaming “I don’t know what I’m doing, but I’m going to help!” scrambled across rooftops, his heavy footfalls nearly punching through shingles on his first jump, barely mantling onto the next roof. Zariel exploded into his Dire Wolf form, a fleeting metallic sheen glinting on his fur, bounding down stairs and through the panicked crowd. Kaladen followed Leopold onto the roofs, stumbling slightly but keeping pace.

From the stage, Thurr roared orders, pushing the crowd back. But even as he directed the defense, the werewolf outside tore an Omen Knight in half with horrifying ease. The Lord Marshall initially declared his intent to charge through the opening himself – “I’m going through! I need you to close the dome behind me!” – but Leopold, surprisingly persuasive, cried out, “Lord Thoreau… you should definitely not go in there!” The plea landed. Thurr halted, stepping back towards the Splitter controls. Yet, even as he rescinded his own charge, a calm, unknown female voice cut through the comm chatter, audible only to those nearby: "Thurr, close the dome. That is an order." Thurr gritted his teeth – "Fucking politicians," he muttered – but complied, the dome shimmering closed, sealing the carnage outside from view, though not from hearing.

Then, Thurr whistled sharply. From the shadows of a rooftop, a figure dropped silently onto the stage – clad in the same sleek, night-black armor Leopold had glimpsed near the fey woman. A thrill of recognition, sharp but frustratingly incomplete, sparked in Leopold’s core. "Glad you notice," Thurr remarked grimly to Kaladen, "He's not just a normal Echolmite, that is one of my Blackguard." At Thurr’s command, the dome split open once more just long enough for the Blackguard Knight to dive through into the fray before sealing shut again.

The fight outside raged unseen, but the danger within intensified. A figure in tattered robes suddenly appeared, shrieking "Fuck the government!" as a crackling beam of radiant energy erupted from the sky, striking the party and Thurr. Leopold, reacting with startling speed, managed to half-dodge, the energy searing harmlessly past. Zariel and Kaladin took the brunt of the holy energy. Zariel, guided by scent and sound, located the attacker amidst the chaos – another robed figure, hand still raised. With a ferocious snarl, the Dire Wolf pounced, hitting with the force of a furry battering ram – a critical blow that slammed the cultist prone, jaws clamped viciously onto his shoulder. Before the man could react, Kaladen was upon him, his new mycelium spear plunging down with lethal, perhaps accidental, finality. A Nat 20. Blood pooled in the cultist’s mouth as his life fled, unspoken words dying on his lips. "Mage threat is down," Kaladin reported tersely over the comms.

Just as Thurr commended their work, the calm female voice returned: "Thurr, you're requested over here." With a curt apology – "I have to leave" – the Lord Marshall leaped impossibly high onto a rooftop and vanished into the urban sprawl.

The respite was short-lived. Leopold spotted another cultist peering around a corner, targeting Kaladen. Without hesitation, Leopold threw himself forward, activating Absorb Elements. Another radiant bolt flared, but Leopold’s quick thinking and deployed shield deflected it harmlessly off the dome with a screech of colliding energies. The second attacker fled into the terrified throngs.

Simultaneously, Zariel’s sharp senses picked out a third extremist – a woman muttering darkly, black paint smeared around her eyes, her hands gathering destructive energy. Kaladin sent a Firebolt searing towards her, disrupting her concentration but not stopping her. Zariel, now face-to-face with her, saw the horrifying truth in her eyes – she was preparing to self-destruct. "History will show that you were wrong," she whispered. In that instant, Zariel made a choice. Forgoing escape, the Dire Wolf leaped, throwing his considerable bulk onto the woman just as she detonated in a blinding flash of radiant power. Zariel took the full, staggering force of the blast, shielding the nearby civilians who were merely thrown back, injured but alive, saved from certain death by the druid's sacrifice.

The immediate danger passed. The second attacker vanished. The plaza slowly emptied, leaving behind shattered stalls, injured citizens, and the grim reality of the assault. Legionnaires secured the perimeter, the Arcane Splitter whisked away under heavy guard. Kaladin, searching the first slain cultist, found the only clue: carved crudely into the man’s skin were the words, "The hand of God is here." These weren't random attacks; they were messages, brutal and fanatical.

Back at a chaotic HQ, Ratshit debriefed them, praising Zariel’s quick thinking. Leopold inquired about the man whose leg he’d… *attempted* to reattach. "Pulled through," Ratshit lied smoothly, a falsehood Zariel’s sharp insight easily pierced. "Maybe I do have a career in medicine after all," Leopold mused proudly, oblivious, as Zariel recalled watching him try to jam the man's femur into his thigh. But the most chilling news came when they reported Thurr's departure. "That's sort of a problem," Ratshit frowned, "As far as we can tell. Nobody called him off."

The mystery of Thurr's disappearance hung heavy in the air, compounded by the new mandate Ratshit delivered: Find the "Hand of God" cultists. Track down their leader. Bring them in alive. Their first lead? The Dawn District, suggested by the cultists' ragged attire.

After a much-needed short rest, Kaladin recalled a place – the Spit and Swallow, a seedy Market District dive known for shady dealings. Perhaps there, amidst the dregs and whispered secrets, they could pick up the trail of this new, dangerous threat. The O’dears? The Wranglers? Mech Squad? The name could wait. Duty, bloody and perplexing, called once more.

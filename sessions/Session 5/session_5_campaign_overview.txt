## Key NPCs

*   **Captain Levi:** Stonewall Legionnaire officer. Wears distinctive 'bucket' hat and vest, wields advanced hand crossbows. Oversees Legionnaire tryouts. Identified the PCs' 'Isoptic Curse' potential, recruited them. Directed the party to Hamhock. Casual but authoritative. Observed by Zariel discussing another dome, missing persons, etc. Personally assigned Case 22391. Summoned the party back to HQ via Ratshit after their tunnel investigation. Conducted Zariel's post-mission briefing: Used silence and indirect questioning. Discerned via Zariel's high Insight that Levi knew about the hidden woman but chose not to press when Zariel omitted her, seemingly satisfied and deciding a course based on this. Observed using a high-tech runic bracelet. *(Not encountered this session)*.
*   **Lord Marshall Thurr:** High-ranking Stonewall Legionnaire leader. 'Bear of a man', beard, scar, cob pipe. Observed tryouts. Confirmed Legionnaire interest in Isoptic Curse. Endorsed Levi's offer. Fought alongside party against Cursed Fire Elemental. Initiated the cursed soldier program. Conducted Kaladin's post-mission briefing regarding the fey woman and Lancex. **Briefed the party and Omen Knights on the Moonhaven expedition and the associated festival, outlining the party's "Watchdog" role against a Dawn District extremist group. Granted Kaladin's request (Persuasion Nat 20) for party involvement in the fey woman's care, providing access to a secure medical facility and acknowledging the unique nature of her mask's magic. Oversaw the festival and ordered the Arcane Splitter's activation. During the subsequent werewolf and cultist attack, he initially intended to enter the Dome but was persuaded by Leopold to remain and manage the Splitter. He then sent his "Blackguard" Knight through the dome instead. Acknowledged the Blackguard's elite status to Kaladin. Abruptly departed the battle after receiving a comm from a calm female voice requesting his presence elsewhere. His current whereabouts and the legitimacy of his recall are unknown.** *(Status: Missing/Unknown Location)*

Explained reward options and processed lottery wins. Conveyed Thurr's instruction about Lancex's club. Assigned downtime. **Provided the party their "Watchdog" assignment for the festival, requesting a group name for official filing. After the festival attack, he debriefed the party, praising Zariel for mitigating an explosion. He lied to Leopold, claiming a severely injured civilian survived (Zariel's insight detected the lie). Assigned the party a new mission: find "The Hand of God" cultists and bring their leader in alive, suggesting they start in the Dawn District. Crucially, he stated that "nobody called [Thurr] off," contradicting the party's hearing of a female voice summoning Thurr and deepening the mystery of Thurr's disappearance.**
*   **Selena Sal:** Eccentric, seemingly ancient potion shop owner (Storm District). Huge goggles, messy bun, patchwork muumuu. Potentially senile or feigning it. Has a talking hermit crab, Marcel.

Mask emits powerful, chaotic Fey magic vital for her survival. **The party decided to turn her over to Legionnaire command. She was successfully transferred to a secure Legionnaire medical sub-level under Lord Marshall Thurr's supervision. The party was granted access runes to visit her. Her condition remains unconscious and unchanged. Kaladin still feels a strong connection to her mask. Zariel experienced a faint sensation in his core when near her and found the medical facility somewhat familiar. Thurr confirmed he had never seen magic like her mask's before.** *(Status: Unconscious, under Legionnaire care in a secure medical facility, party has access)*
*   **Blackguard Knight (Formerly "Omen Knight (Unnamed)"):** Extremely imposing figure in sleek, all-black armor with jagged pauldrons and an enormous greatsword. Reported the party's discovery of the fey woman to Thurr. **Confirmed by Thurr to be one of his "Blackguard," an elite type of knight. During the festival attack, Thurr deployed this Knight through the reopened dome to combat the werewolf. Leopold experienced a "click" of recognition upon seeing the Blackguard Knight but could not place the memory.** *(Status: Active, currently outside the Arcane Dome fighting the werewolf)*
*   **Unnamed Posh Nobleman:** Arrogant participant in Legionnaire tryouts; Kaladin's opponent. Revealed he was cursed, transformed into a Fire Elemental. *(Status: Deceased/Destroyed as Fire Elemental)*

*   **Festival Attack and Rise of "The Hand of God":** *(New)* During a public festival celebrating an Omen Knight expedition to Moonhaven (enabled by the newly activated Arcane Splitter), a monstrous werewolf attacked Legionnaires outside the dome while extremist cultists, identified as "The Hand of God," simultaneously launched a coordinated assault from within the festival. The party played a crucial role in defending citizens and neutralizing several cultists. This event revealed a dangerous new internal threat and led to the party's new primary mission to hunt down the cult.

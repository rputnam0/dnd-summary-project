The weight of their recent, unsettling discoveries in the Dawn District pressed heavily upon Kaladen, Leopold, and Zariel – now begrudgingly known to their handler as "The O’dears." Ushered into a stark Legionnaire meeting room, they found themselves before a formidable trio: the ever-cynical Ratshit, the observant Captain Levi, and, to their surprise, the imposing Lord Marshall Thurr, a man recently absent under a shroud of high-council secrecy. Ratshit, with a sigh that seemed to carry the burden of all bureaucratic procedure, initiated "meeting 435," gesturing for the O’dears to plead their case for immediate action against the burgeoning Hand of God cult.

Leopold, ever the pragmatist, projected an arcane map displaying five Viteo chapels, including the one where they’d recently clashed with cultists and abducted the gatekeeper, Xander. "This is where we encountered the cultists," he stated, his metallic finger tracing their path. "I suggest we enter all four chapels… at the same time, coming in with a crash party." Kaladen underscored the urgency. "It feels like this group is more organized than we understand," he urged, adding decisively, "We have the keys for one of the entrances right now." Zariel, his brow furrowed with concern, voiced the group's fear. "They are efficient and very dedicated to their cause. Going in guns blazing without sufficient troops could be pretty disastrous."

Captain Levi, his gaze sharp, cut through their concerns. "Am I to understand… you made yourselves known… and then subsequently kidnapped this tiefling individual?" A grim silence followed before he conceded, "This is not a very good situation." Lord Marshall Thurr, his voice a low rumble, finally spoke. Despite pressing matters – a whispered confidence to Kaladen later revealed Thurr was "under scrutiny of the council" and tracking a suspected "leak in our government itself" – he allocated significant resources: Ratshit would lead the O'dears; Levi, a separate strike team for reconnaissance and rapid response; and a task force of elite Omen Knights would hit a third location. "Do you think you can do this?" Thurr challenged. Leopold's request for booby traps on the remaining exits was met with a compromise: one of Levi’s mages could be spared to "blow it up" if necessary.

With plans laid, Ratshit, muttering, "I'm not calling myself the O'Dears," led them to a supply room, equipping them with enchanted suppression cuffs and arcane stun grenades – miniature suns designed to disorient. As they prepared, the Omen Knight task force arrived: Sylvaris Sunseeker, their arrogant, blonde-haired leader, flanked by three identically armored figures he introduced with a spit of tobacco. "Laser. Blazer. Taser." Leopold, poking Laser, elicited a surprising admission: "In all honesty, I'm a natural redhead. I just dyed it silver to match him." More crucially, Laser mentioned seeing Leopold's "Bone Crusher" emblem on "someone higher up," a detail Leopold, in his robotic way, seemed to momentarily file away without full comprehension.

A quick detour to Hamhawk's forge saw their comms upgraded with a much-needed quiet mode. Kaladen noticed a schematic for a "plasma sword," and Leopold, his intellect sparking, offered a design suggestion for an internal power source that genuinely impressed the gruff smith. "If you can find a fucking energy source that can take a sustained current," Hamhawk grunted, "I'll think of actually making you my apprentice."

Dusk settled over the Dawn District, a low, eerie fog rolling through the streets as the O'dears, cloaked in Zariel’s Pass Without Trace, approached the Court of Viteo. The courtyard was unnervingly silent, empty. Using Xander's key, they descended into the mausoleum's darkness. The stone steps led to a vast, empty chamber littered with hundreds of discarded cups and freshly snuffed candles. Leopold’s analysis revealed an alchemical residue in the cups; a mouse, coaxed by Zariel to taste it, began to hallucinate wildly. Ratshit, a disturbed look on his face, sensed a radiant energy, "but there's something off about it… I'm not entirely sure I like what this means."

Deeper they pressed, into unlit, carved stone tunnels. Distant chanting grew louder. Suddenly, their comms crackled with raw panic. Sylvaris Sunseeker’s voice, fragmented: "Anybody who could pick this up? It was a trap. We're fucking surrounded… Send somebody!" Then, silence. Captain Levi’s voice followed, strained but steady, "Holy shit, it's the whole fucking town's coming alive… thousands… walking down the street in unison." The city was erupting.

The chanting ahead intensified. The O’dears, Ratshit casting Bless upon them, burst into a huge, broken-down chapel within a natural cavern. The air was thick, still. At a weathered altar, before a massive stained-glass window, knelt a lone, hooded figure. He rose, turning, and the hood fell away. Father Kallor. "When I first saw you," he said, his voice laden with a sorrow that belied the fervor in his eyes, "I thought maybe you would join." Kaladen, anticipating betrayal, shimmered as Mirror Images flickered into existence around him. Kallor began his sermon of damnation: "This world has forgotten its roots… I serve a god from a different age… I serve Teo, God of Wrath."

"I'm sorry, but I'm against you," Leopold declared. Kallor, with a resigned, "Fine. If I must, I will guide you to the truth," raised his hand. Battle erupted. Leopold’s Witch Bolt, augmented by Ratshit's Guidance, crackled through the air, felling one of Kallor’s two bald, robed monk acolytes, followed swiftly by a Magic Stone that dropped the other. Zariel, a colossal bear, charged, his Flaming Sphere rolling before him. Kaladen’s Fire Bolt seared Kallor’s shoulder. "I knew you'd be trouble!" the old priest cried, unleashing a Guiding Bolt that struck Zariel's bear form.

Leopold, with a theatrical flourish, taunted, "Well, I came here to do two things. Chew bubblegum… and kill old people. And I just ran out of bubblegum!" His Fire Bolt slammed into Kallor. The old man’s body seized, caught in mid-air, light erupting from his joints, his eyes, his mouth. He convulsed, twisted, expanded, and then *exploded*. Where Father Kallor had stood, an angelic being of terrible light now floated, wings vast, a broken greatsword materializing in its grasp from the stained-glass window. The ground quaked. "Be it as you may," The Reverend boomed, "I still must kill you." Leopold, unfazed, launched a Magic Stone that struck true, a Nat 20 that scored deep into the radiant horror.

The Reverend, with a sweep of his hand, declared, "Four on one is hardly fair!" The fallen monks stirred, their flesh sloughing away to reveal skeletal Undead Soldiers. The battle intensified. Zariel, back in bear form, clawed at The Reverend, who retaliated with devastating blows from his ethereal blade. A Guiding Bolt seared the bear, then a legendary sword strike sent Zariel sprawling, the bear form dissolving, his true form taking a brutal 11 spillover damage.

Comms crackled again. Levi: "Reports that something's going on at the Core as well. All available soldiers to the Core." Then, a hushed, frantic voice directly to Kaladen – Beatrice, from the Med Bay. "There's people trying to get in the door… They might be coming for her." Kaladen relayed the dire news. "The Core is under siege!" He unleashed a Thunderwave, blasting the Undead Soldiers back.

But The Reverend was relentless. Another sword strike, a sickening crunch, and Zariel collapsed, unconscious. Ratshit, after taking a vicious hit himself, failed to revive the druid with a Toll the Dead. Leopold, seeing Zariel fall and hearing Kaladin's urgent warning, urged Ratshit to help, then dashed for cover. Zariel failed his first death save.

As Zariel lay bleeding on the cold stone, his consciousness spiraled into a fragmented memory: a sterile white room, the Ratshiting sound of mechanisms, and his own hand, glinting, *metallic*, clenching before him. A voice: "This one's awake, put him out." On the battlefield, as The Reverend healed himself and his minions with a pulse of divine energy from the stained-glass window, Kaladen and Leopold glanced at their fallen friend. Through the torn fabric of Zariel’s shoulder, where the greatsword had struck, they saw it: a distinct, unmistakable glint of metal beneath the skin. The battle raged, the city burned, and the true nature of one of their own lay chillingly exposed.

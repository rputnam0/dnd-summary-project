Observed by Zariel discussing another dome, missing persons, etc. Personally assigned Case 22391. Summoned the party back to HQ via Ratshit after their tunnel investigation. Conducted Zariel's post-mission briefing: Used silence and indirect questioning. Discerned via Zariel's high Insight that Levi knew about the hidden woman but chose not to press when Zariel omitted her, seemingly satisfied and deciding a course based on this. Observed using a high-tech runic bracelet.

Led a strike team to provide reconnaissance and overwatch for the party's infiltration.

Granted Kaladin's request (Persuasion Nat 20) for party involvement in the fey woman's care. Oversaw the festival and ordered the Arcane Splitter's activation. During the subsequent werewolf and cultist attack, he was persuaded by Leopold to remain and manage the Splitter, sending his "Blackguard" Knight through instead. Abruptly departed the battle after receiving a comm from a calm female voice requesting his presence elsewhere.
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Returned to Legionnaire HQ. Attended the urgent Hand of God cult briefing, allocating significant resources: Ratchet to lead the party's group, Levi to lead a strike team, and an Omen Knight task force.

Upgraded Kaladin's and Zariel's armor to medium for cost of materials. Informed Kaladin that potions/rings of protection are Market District finds or for deserving Legionnaires.

    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Quickly upgraded the party's comms system with a quiet/loud toggle. Was observed by the party working on a schematic for a new "plasma sword" design.

Stated Dawn District is not his primary responsibility (Storm District is). Denied Kaladin's request for an armor voucher. Rudely dismissed Leopold's offer to help with paperwork ("You are my fucking subordinate. Get the fuck out of here.").
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Documented ("Meeting 435") the Hand of God cult briefing. Assigned by Thurr to lead and accompany the party's infiltration group. Provided them with extra gear (enchanted cuffs, arcane stun grenades, extra healing). Joined the party in the mausoleum infiltration. In the "mass suicide" chamber, detected "off" radiant energy coating residue in cups, expressing unease. Provided combat support with Bless, Guidance (to Leopold), Shatter, and Toll the Dead. Argued with Leopold mid-combat about the metaphysics of healing Zariel's bear form. Took 20 damage from an Undead Soldier. *(Status: Active, with the party in The Reverend's chapel, wounded)*.
*   **Selena Sal:** Eccentric, seemingly ancient potion shop owner (Storm District). Huge goggles, messy bun, patchwork muumuu. Potentially senile or feigning it. Has a talking hermit crab, Marcel. Her shop contains the hidden entrance to the Fungal Tunnels. Her involvement/awareness remains unknown. *(Not encountered Session 2-9)*.

*   **Mysterious Woman on Altar:** Young, fair-skinned woman with dirty brown hair. Wears a well-crafted glass mask filled with living plants. Mask emits powerful, chaotic Fey magic vital for her survival. Turned over to Legionnaire command, housed in secure medical sub-level under Thurr's supervision. Party has access runes. Condition remains unconscious. Kaladin feels connection to mask. Zariel found facility familiar, felt faint connection to her. Thurr noted unique magic. Kaladin's dreams suggest a connection to an entity trying to get "out."
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Still unconscious in the Legionnaire Med Bay. Her location is now under direct threat, as Beatrice (Med Bay staff) reported to Kaladin that intruders are trying to breach the Med Bay doors during the city-wide cultist uprising. *(Status: Unconscious, under Legionnaire care, location currently under attack)*
*   **Blackguard Knight (Formerly "Omen Knight (Unnamed)"):** Extremely imposing figure in sleek, all-black armor with jagged pauldrons and an enormous greatsword. Reported party's discovery of fey woman to Thurr. Confirmed by Thurr as elite "Blackguard." Deployed by Thurr through the reopened dome during festival attack to fight werewolf. Leopold felt "click" of recognition but couldn't place it (potential link to brother Victor or scribe Victor Holloway). *(Status: Active, last seen outside the Arcane Dome fighting the werewolf)*
*   **Unnamed Posh Nobleman:** Arrogant participant in Legionnaire tryouts; Kaladin's opponent. Revealed he was cursed, transformed into a Fire Elemental. *(Status: Deceased/Destroyed as Fire Elemental)*
*   **Philindra Sprawlweaver:** Owner of the "Mystical Scripts Scroll" shop in the Market District. Professional, friendly woman. *(Not encountered Session 5-9)*.
*   **Cedric ("The Champ"):** Large, muscular man (pugilist build), champion of the Spit and Swallow fighting pit. Initially wore simple hand wraps; post-transformation, fists and forearms appear wrapped in inlaid gold, part of his skin/tattoos. Wears a waist chain/rosary with an iron symbol of a right hand (palm outward, curled fingers - Hand of God symbol). Initially stoic, becomes respectful/apologetic after defeat, missing teeth.
    *   **Abilities & Curse:** Challenged the party after their pit victories. Possesses significant power linked to the Isoptric Curse. Can unleash energy to heal/empower others (leveled party to 4). In combat, uses multi-attack (fists, kick), Calculated Loss (bonus action move/debuff), legendary actions for extra attacks, inflicts delayed radiant damage, and applies conditions (Stun via Tunnel Vision, Action Denial via Out of Breath) on hits via CON saves. Under pressure, underwent a transformation: radiant energy pulsed, veins glowed, eyes shone, forearms gained golden inlay, power increased but control seemed diminished (similar to Fire Elemental transformation). Claimed to channel power from the goddess Viteo, but the transformation felt unprecedented/uncontrolled to him.
    *   **Hand of God Connection:** Confirmed affiliation with the "Hand of God" cult, acting as a "scouter" finding talent for them. Provided the party with the cult's base location (a chapel basement in the Dawn District) and gave them his Hand symbol token as a potential means of access/introduction. Became defensive when pressed by Leopold about direct involvement. Spotted by Leopold attending Father Kallor's sermon at the Court of Viteo. Xander (cultist) later confirmed Cedric recruits for the cult. *(Status: Defeated by party, provided information & token, remains at Spit and Swallow, known to frequent Court of Viteo)*
*   **High Cleric Father Kallor / The Reverend:** *(Massive Update)* Formerly presented as an old, frail-appearing public figure (poofs of gray hair, smacking lips, obscured eyes, large gray-brown robes, carries a large chained tome), High Cleric of the Court of Viteo running for council.
    *   **(Session 9 Revelation):** Revealed himself to be **"The Reverend,"** the fanatical leader of the "Hand of God" cult. Confronted the party in his hidden chapel/cavern beneath the Court of Viteo. Monologued about serving "Teo, God of Wrath," an alleged primordial, suppressed aspect of Viteo, and his mission to "cleanse this world." Attempted to convert the party.
    *   **Transformation & Abilities:** Upon being damaged by Leopold, Kallor's body convulsed and exploded with light, transforming him into **The Reverend:** a powerful, floating angelic being with expansive wings, eyes emblazoned in light, and wielding a large, broken-but-hovering greatsword summoned from a stained-glass window. His attacks deal significant physical and radiant damage (e.g., Guiding Bolt). Possesses Lair Actions (summoned Undead Soldiers from fallen monks, healed self and allies) and Legendary Actions (extra attacks).
    *   *(Status: Revealed as The Reverend, Transformed, Actively engaged in a fierce battle against the party and Ratchet in his underground lair. Simultaneously, his cult has launched a city-wide uprising.)*
*   **Xander (Cultist Groundskeeper):** "Devilishly handsome" male with Tiefling-esque features. Publicly a groundskeeper at the Court of Viteo, tending rose bushes. Secretly a member and gatekeeper for "The Hand of God" cult. When the party approached the mausoleum, he tested them with a "justice or wrath?" question (Kaladin answered "justice"). Later charmed by Leopold (failed Wisdom save, Nat 2). Under charm, he confirmed "wrath" was the correct answer, expressed trust in Leopold (but not his friends), and gave Leopold his key to the mausoleum. Was then convinced by Leopold to leave the grounds and was subsequently abducted by the party and taken to a Legionnaire holding cell. During interrogation (after charm wore off), he revealed the Hand of God cult operates in extensive tunnels beneath the main Viteo chapel, has hundreds of members (many poor folk "fed" by the leader), and is led by "The Reverend." Confirmed Cedric is a recruiter. Warned the party they are marked and will die, then suffered a mental breakdown, muttering about purification and desecration. Found with a short sword and a hidden bent-finger Hand of God talisman. *(Status: Captured by party, interrogated, held in Legionnaire HQ, mentally unstable. His key was used by the party to access the mausoleum tunnels.)*
*   **Sylvaris Sunseeker (Omen Knight Leader):** *(New Key NPC)* Tall, elven-heritage man with striking blonde hair, a cut jawline, and a muscular build. Wears intricate, deep obsidian black armor that radiates a magical aura. Arrogant and confident. Leader of the Omen Knight task force assigned by Thurr to assist the party's assault on the Hand of God cult. Introduced his team as "Laser, Blazer, and Taser." Coordinated with the party on their entry point into a secondary cult location. Shortly after infiltration began, his panicked voice was heard over comms: "Anybody who could pick this up? It was a trap. We're fucking surrounded... Send somebody." The transmission then cut out. *(Status: Ambushed by cultists, fate unknown, presumed to be in dire peril or overrun).*

## Important Events So Far

*   **Festival Attack and Rise of "The Hand of God":** During a public festival celebrating an Omen Knight expedition to Moonhaven (enabled by the newly activated Arcane Splitter), a monstrous werewolf attacked Legionnaires outside the dome while extremist cultists, identified as "The Hand of God," simultaneously launched a coordinated assault from within the festival. The party played a crucial role in defending citizens and neutralizing several cultists. This event revealed a dangerous new internal threat and led to the party's new primary mission to hunt down the cult.
*   **Revelation of 'The Reverend' and City-Wide Cult Uprising (Session 9):** While infiltrating the Hand of God's base beneath the Court of Viteo, the party confronted High Cleric Father Kallor, who revealed himself as "The Reverend," the cult's fanatical leader. Kallor transformed into a powerful angelic being, and simultaneously, the cult launched a massive, coordinated uprising across New New Arbor, with an Omen Knight task force ambushed and the Legionnaire Core itself coming under attack. The party is currently locked in battle with The Reverend.

## Ongoing Mysteries & Goals

*   What is the full nature, origin, and range of effects of the Isoptic Curse? (Note: Stress Point activation observed. Cedric demonstrated significant power increase, transformation. **Father Kallor transformed into the powerful angelic being, The Reverend, possibly another manifestation or divinely amplified curse.** Cost/drawbacks still largely unknown.)
*   What are the details surrounding Zariel's memory loss and 'accident'? What is the significance of his dream of stasis/medical care? (Note: Metallic sheen. Legionnaire medical facility felt "somewhat familiar". Dream of "Project." **(Session 9 Update): While unconscious, Zariel experienced a vivid vision/memory of seeing his own metallic hand, hearing ratcheting sounds, and someone saying "This one's awake, put him out." Kaladin and Leopold also witnessed a metallic glint in Zariel's shoulder wound. This strongly confirms his Warforged nature and an experimental, traumatic past.**)
*   What happened during Leopold's past (deactivation, memory issues)? What is the story behind his "Bone Grinder" emblem? Was his brother truly an Omen Knight named Victor? What did his dream signify? (Note: Memory flashes. Felt recognition with Blackguard Knight. Encountered scribe Victor Holloway. Spotted "Dome Exploration" assignment. **(Session 9 Update): Omen Knight Laser mentioned seeing the "Bone Crusher" emblem on someone "higher up" than Leopold in the Legionnaires.**)
*   What were Kaladin's specific dreams motivating him? What is the nature of his connection to the Feywild/past lives hinted at in dreams/vision? (Note: Potent Fey magic discovered. Researched Feywild. Connection to fey woman's mask. Disturbing dreams. **(Session 9 Update): His concern for the Fey Woman was evident when Beatrice reported the Med Bay under attack, linking to his protective instincts possibly fueled by dreams.**)
*   What are the potential consequences or drawbacks of using Stress Points? (Note: Power demonstrated, 3 used by Zariel, 1 by Leopold. Cost remains unknown. Zariel collapsed after using two in Session 6.)
*   Who was the figure Kaladin saw watching him before the tryouts?
*   What is the significance of Zariel's red-tipped orchid?
*   How common is the Isoptic Curse? How is it perceived? (Note: Thurr actively recruiting/testing. Cedric example. **The Reverend's transformation could be related.**)
*   What is the full power structure of the Stonewall Legionnaires and New New Arbor? What is the significance of the Omen Knights and Alabaster Lords? (Note: Omen Knights elite. Thurr commands "Blackguard." Zariel's dream mentioned a "Council member." High Cleric Kallor ran for council. **(Session 9 Update): Lord Marshall Thurr privately informed Kaladin he is under scrutiny by the council and suspects a significant leak within the government itself.**)
*   What is the significance of Captain Levi's meeting regarding another domed city? (Note: Related to Moonhaven mission, which was attacked.)
*   What is the nature and origin of the Myconids in the Fungal Tunnels? What is their goal? (Note: Assimilate victims, guarded Fey presence. Lancex was test subject. Source/motive unknown.)
*   Where are the missing people from the Storm District? (Note: Lancex found. Others unknown. "Hand of God" cult a factor. Father Kallor reported missing poor folk. **(Session 9 Update): The "mass ritual/suicide" chamber in the cult's base might account for some missing individuals in a grim manner. The city-wide uprising indicates vast numbers of active cultists.**)
*   Is Selena Sal involved with, complicit in, or ignorant of the Myconid/Fey activity beneath her shop?
*   What is the significance of the small film reel Leopold received?
*   What will happen on Leopold's arranged "date" with Marcel the Hermit Crab?
*   Who/what is the mysterious woman found on the altar? What is the purpose/nature of her plant-filled mask and connection to Fey magic? (Note: Mask vital. In Legionnaire care. Kaladin's dreams/connection. **(Session 9 Update): Her safety is critically endangered as the Legionnaire Med Bay, her current location, is under direct attack by cultists.**)
*   Who is the "he" that Lancex warned is "coming for her"? (Note: Phrase echoed in Kaladin's nightmare. Kaladin's dream voice ("Let me out"). **(Session 9 Update): The direct attack on the Med Bay makes this warning feel highly imminent.**)
*   What is the full extent and origin of the Fey magic presence in the Fungal Tunnels?
*   What are the Omen Knights' specific roles, powers, and allegiances? (Note: Elite squad. Moonhaven team ambushed. Thurr's "Blackguard" Knight. **(Session 9 Update): Sylvaris Sunseeker's Omen Knight task force was ambushed by Hand of God cultists and likely overrun during a coordinated assault.**)
*   What was the significance of the Albatross blood drawing ("one for sorrow") found in the tunnels?
*   What is the creature from Kaladin's dream? (Note: Original dream involved spider-like creature. New dream involved a pit and voice.)

*   What is the full extent, leadership, and ultimate goal of "The Hand of God" cult? Why did they attack the festival? (Note: Base beneath Court of Viteo. Xander's intel. **(Session 9 Massive Update): Leader identified as High Cleric Father Kallor, who revealed himself as "The Reverend." He worships "Teo, God of Wrath," an alleged suppressed, primordial aspect of Viteo, and aims to "cleanse the world." Kallor transformed into a powerful angelic being. The cult uses alchemical substances in rituals (evidenced by "mass ritual/suicide" chamber). They have launched a massive, coordinated city-wide uprising involving thousands of cultists and are attacking key locations, including the Legionnaire Core.**)
*   What happened to Lord Marshall Thurr after his abrupt departure during the festival attack? Is he safe, and what was the nature of the summons he received? `(Partially Resolved in Session 9)` (He returned to HQ, briefed the party, and revealed he is under council scrutiny and investigating an internal leak.)

Scribe Victor Holloway. **(Session 9 Update): Omen Knight Laser mentioned seeing the "Bone Crusher" emblem on someone "higher up."**)
*   What will the Omen Knights (and the deployed Blackguard) find at Moonhaven, and what will be their ultimate fate against the werewolf and other potential external threats?

*   What is the significance of the recurring "metallic sheen" observed on Zariel, particularly on his fur when in Dire Wolf form? **(Session 9 Update): A metallic glint was observed by Kaladin and Leopold in Zariel's shoulder wound while he was unconscious. His vision confirmed a metallic hand.**
*   What is Cedric's exact role within the Hand of God cult ("scouter")? What is the nature and source of his significant magical abilities (Isoptric Curse, Viteo channeling)? What were his motives for testing and empowering the party before fighting them? (Note: Claimed uncontrolled power surge. Xander confirmed Cedric is a recruiter. Cedric attends Father Kallor's sermons. **Kallor being The Reverend solidifies Cedric's role as a direct agent.**)

*   Is the library scribe Victor Holloway connected in any way to Leopold's brother Victor?

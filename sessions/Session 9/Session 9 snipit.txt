Leopold, ever the pragmatist, projected an arcane map displaying five Viteo chapels, including the one where they’d recently clashed with cultists and abducted the gatekeeper, Xander. "This is where we encountered the cultists," he stated, his metallic finger tracing their path. "I suggest we enter all four chapels… at the same time, coming in with a crash party." Kaladen underscored the urgency. "It feels like this group is more organized than we understand," he urged, adding decisively, "We have the keys for one of the entrances right now." Zariel, his brow furrowed with concern, voiced the group's fear. "They are efficient and very dedicated to their cause. Going in guns blazing without sufficient troops could be pretty disastrous."

Captain Levi, his gaze sharp, cut through their concerns. "Am I to understand… you made yourselves known… and then subsequently kidnapped this tiefling individual?" A grim silence followed before he conceded, "This is not a very good situation." Lord Marshall Thurr, his voice a low rumble, finally spoke. Despite pressing matters – a whispered confidence to Kaladen later revealed Thurr was "under scrutiny of the council" and tracking a suspected "leak in our government itself" – he allocated significant resources: Ratshit would lead the O'dears; Levi, a separate strike team for reconnaissance and rapid response; and a task force of elite Omen Knights would hit a third location. "Do you think you can do this?" Thurr challenged. Leopold's request for booby traps on the remaining exits was met with a compromise: one of Levi’s mages could be spared to "blow it up" if necessary.

With plans laid, Ratshit, muttering, "I'm not calling myself the O'Dears," led them to a supply room, equipping them with enchanted suppression cuffs and arcane stun grenades – miniature suns designed to disorient. As they prepared, the Omen Knight task force arrived: Sylvaris Sunseeker, their arrogant, blonde-haired leader, flanked by three identically armored figures he introduced with a spit of tobacco. "Laser. Blazer. Taser." Leopold, poking Laser, elicited a surprising admission: "In all honesty, I'm a natural redhead. I just dyed it silver to match him." More crucially, Laser mentioned seeing Leopold's "Bone Crusher" emblem on "someone higher up," a detail Leopold, in his robotic way, seemed to momentarily file away without full comprehension.

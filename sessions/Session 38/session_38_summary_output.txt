The Feywild breathes, a realm of vibrant chaos where the laws of reality are merely suggestions. For the Guardians of the Wild, five mismatched souls bound by a sacred duty, this chaotic pulse was the very air in their lungs. Their quest, a desperate race against time to deliver the amber-encased souls of Avarias’s heroes to the Tree of Life, was nearing its end. Yet, the Feywild had one last gift of madness to bestow. The party’s reluctant rogue, Gooch III, already cursed and blessed by a Deck of Many Things, was now saddled not only with a magically summoned son, Gooch IV, but also his own senile, recently-resurrected father, Gooch II, who had been plucked from the afterlife in a subsequent, ill-advised card pull.

Their journey pressed on, a strange parade of stoicism and absurdity. Alabaster, the loxodon paladin, a mountain of quiet resolve, made a pact with the very fabric of their fate, forgoing a measure of his own power to grant his companions a miraculous boon: an elixir of regeneration that knitted wounds with but a thought. They navigated treacherous canyons and trundled through a pocket dimension of zero gravity, a void where they had to propel themselves with the sheer force of their intellect—a harrowing and slow process for a party of brawlers. At last, they reached their destination: the Eternal Court, a magnificent palace floating derelict in a sea of spiraling galaxies. But it was not empty. Old tracks marred the ground, the split-hoof prints of swine, and the air carried the rank smell of warlords who had made this sacred place their sty.

With a stealth born of desperation and honed by a Loxodon hiding other party members behind his bulk, they slipped past gnoll sentries and wolf-men patrols. The throne room loomed. Foregoing any further subtlety, Alabaster simply grabbed the tortle monk, Tortimus, by the shell. “Pull that head in,” he grunted, and with the force of a siege engine, kicked the monk through a beautiful stained-glass door, shattering it into a thousand pieces.

Inside stood the three boar warlords. Their leader, a brutish giant named Sir Loin, sneered. "Well, well, well," he began, launching into a prepared monologue about their rise from prey to power, a gift from a mysterious Archfey. But as he spoke, a horrifying drama unfolded behind him. The most rotund of the three, Belly, clawed feverishly at his own stomach, his scratching revealing a phrase carved into his flesh in bleeding, black ichor: *four for a birth*. His body began to bloat, hideously expanding like a balloon until he was a gargantuan monster. With a sickening crunch, the newly born Boar Titan bit its former leader in half, his monologue cut short by a splatter of gore against the far wall.

The battle was a tempest of desperation and fury. The Titan was a force of nature, slamming its cleavers to send out shockwaves and unleashing storms of razor-sharp quills from its back. It flattened Barrow, the porcine barbarian, leaving him for dead. Karak, the avian ranger, became a living thunderbolt, repeatedly diving from the ceiling to strike the beast. But the true story of the battle belonged to the most unlikely of heroes. Gooch III, the cowardly halfling who had spent most of the journey hiding, became a whirlwind of death. He darted through the chaos, his dagger finding purchase again and again. With a flick of his wrist, he dispatched the remaining warlord, Brat, then turned his attention to the true threat.

The fight raged. Alabaster, a bastion of righteousness, roared, “I am inevitable!” and unleashed a divine smite that cracked the Titan’s hide, bathing the room in holy light. Barrow, revived by Alabaster’s healing touch and embarrassed by his near-death experience, turned invisible and clambered up the leg of a nearby decorative tree to hide. The Titan, enraged, charged back and forth in a spiraling vortex of destruction, catching heroes in its wake and leaving Alabaster on the brink of death.

It was then that Gooch, seeing his moment, struck for the final time. As the beast charged past, he didn't just strike—he found a flaw in its very being. With a preternatural lunge that defied his small stature, he drove his dagger into the back of the monster’s knee. There was no grand explosion, only the quiet shink of steel finding its mark. The gargantuan Boar Titan, slayer of its own kind and the terror of the court, crumpled, its rampage over. Gooch had landed a staggering six critical, fight-altering blows, transforming from a joke into a legend.

In the ringing silence, the party caught its breath. But the Feywild was not finished. When Tortimus cautiously approached the lone willow tree in the corner, setting one of the precious amber eggs at its base, the tree snatched it. It was a mimic, a final trap. The party erupted into action one last time. As the creature dashed for the door, they unleashed a volley of desperate attacks. And once more, it was Gooch’s dagger, thrown with uncanny precision, that felled the beast, its wooden form splintering to reveal the unharmed egg within.

The true path was finally revealed. Barrow, licking his wounds, discovered an oil painting of a majestic tree that rippled at his touch. It was a portal. One by one, the Guardians of the Wild stepped through into a sun-drenched grove, the Feywild as it was meant to be, pristine and vibrant. Before them stood the true Tree of Life. With reverence, they placed each amber egg into a cradle of roots at its base. A golden light erupted, shooting from the tree into the heavens. Their mission was complete.

As the light faded, Alabaster turned to their unlikely savior. "So Gooch," he asked, a hint of awe in his voice, "what'd you wish for?"

Gooch shrugged, the weight of his heroic deeds settling on his small shoulders. "Oh, uh… I guess I just wished they had like a shit ton of money. You know, that's always helpful."

And across the planes, the O’Dears awoke. Reborn, renewed, their minds still foggy from their cosmic slumber, they opened their eyes to an idyllic oasis. The air was sweet, the sound of a spring bubbled nearby. And sitting in the center of their new beginning, sinking slightly into the soft earth under its own immense weight, was a single, colossal, perfectly formed piece of solid gold, shaped unmistakably like a turd. One shit ton of gold, delivered as requested.

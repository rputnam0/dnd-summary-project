The water closed over their heads like a silent, green curtain, swallowing the sky and muffling the world. Below, the shattered city of Moonhaven slept a cold, drowned sleep. This was no mere ruin; it was a tomb. The O’dears descended into its depths, a strange procession of monsters and machines. Kaladen, his features shifted by fey magic to sprout functioning gills, swam with an unnatural grace. Leopold and Zariel, automatons immune to the crushing pressure and the need for air, moved with mechanical purpose. Cletus, having plunged into the depths, was now a magnificent, sprawling octopus, while Cyrus, in a fit of whimsical inspiration, scuttled along the algae-slicked cobblestones as a giant crab, his claws held aloft. “What a gift it is to myself to be a giant crab,” he’d declared telepathically, a sentiment punctuated by the joyful *click-clack* of his shell against ancient stone.

They followed the gentle, almost imperceptible pull of the current—a current that Kaladen’s fey-touched mask recognized as a pulse, a faint heartbeat from the city's core. They moved through what was once the Mithilorn District, a place of Silverwood trees, now just a graveyard of massive, petrified stumps and skeletal, collapsed homes. The city was built in tiers, like a great stone fountain, and as they ascended to the next level—the Silphane District—a flash of insight struck Leopold. With the certainty of a long-forgotten lecture, he recalled the city’s layout: six districts, each named for a tree, each with a purpose—residential, mercantile, and at its heart, the holy district of Calathiel, the Tree of Light.

Their exploration, however, was on borrowed time. As hours stretched into a surreal underwater trek, a dawning horror set in. The magic holding Cyrus’s crab form began to fray; the gills on Kaladen’s neck felt thin, the water suddenly thick and suffocating. Their temporary life support was failing. Panic, cold and sharp, spurred them to action. Their only hope lay in a strange sight they’d been avoiding: buildings cushioned by enormous, silvery sacs of spider silk. Cletus, recalling a similar phenomenon from his farm, recognized them for what they were—air pockets, giant diving bells woven by an unseen arachnid colony. “Why don’t we pop in one of these buildings,” he suggested, “see if big mama spider’s home.”

With no other choice, they cut a slit into a web-sealed parchment shop and tumbled into a claustrophobic, air-filled tunnel. The passage, lit by the ethereal glow of Feywild-native fungi, was one of countless that formed a city-spanning hive. To navigate this terrifying new terrain, Cletus underwent a gruesome transformation. His form elongated, bones cracking as new limbs tore from his back, until he stood as a Giant Wolf Spider. He placed his many feet upon the web and listened.

To his newfound senses, the web was a map of breathtaking scope. He felt the thrum of thousands of worker spiders—their eyes a clouded, zombie-like blue—moving in unison on great “web highways.” And at the very center of it all, he felt a vast, silent consciousness, a monstrous creature he could only name in a hushed, telepathic whisper: “I found spider mommy.” Yet, he also found their salvation: a quiet, untraveled path leading directly toward the pulse Kaladen had been chasing.

Guided by Cletus's eight-eyed vigilance, the O’dears crept through the silent webs, finally arriving at a dead-end tunnel. Before them, through the translucent silk, was a vast, submerged chamber dominated by a 50-foot mural carved with the history of an age. The pulse Kaladen felt was thrumming from a single point: the outstretched hand of a carved elven child. Drawn by an unseen force, he swam out and touched it.

The world vanished. To the party, Kaladen simply went limp, sinking to the floor in a magically induced slumber that would last five hours. But for Kaladen, an eternity unfolded in seconds. The voice of Faye Lara whispered in his mind—*“Here, you will find who you are”*—and the mural’s story poured into his soul. He witnessed the birth of Avarias, not as a land of refugees, but as a deliberate sanctuary created by the Elder God Jeya, a goddess of fey and creation. He saw her place the great wellsprings and guide the Induven to safety. And then, the mural’s carvings shifted, revealing a secret prophecy hidden within the stone: a cryptic ritual to crown the next Fae King. The path was laid bare, a terrible and glorious destiny: *“...at the source of death’s life, they who would be crowned Lord must give to nourish the realm... and must give up their identity to be reborn in life’s death with the breath of life and the twilight weave of the eternal court.”*

Kaladen awoke hours later in the cozy confines of Zariel’s Pocket Workshop, the party having set up camp to wait out his magical coma. As he relayed the staggering vision of his potential apotheosis, a new voice cut through their shared thoughts—this one frantic, desperate, and familiar. It was Ratshit, his voice a hushed string of *Sending* spells fired directly into Cyrus’s mind.

The news was a gut punch. “After you left, Lord Marshall went nuts,” the messages came, choppy and panicked. “Chaos for a week or two... Lord of Advancement took control... Dangerous army of warforged patrolling streets as new soldiers.” Calmera Windrider, the sinister figure from Leopold’s past, had staged a military coup. New New Arbor was under martial law, its First Council vanished. The O'dears' home was no longer their own. Ratshit, now a fugitive, ended his stream of warnings with a final, desperate plea for them to return, followed by a moment of profound, comical confusion. Having relayed Cyrus’s concerned query, his last message was a testament to the absurd chaos that had consumed their world:

“What are puppies?”

The vision left the lingering scent of wildflowers.

In combat with the Gnoll general Emery Razorback, he successfully resisted a *Dominate Person* spell due to his Fey Ancestry.
        *   The Spider Gauntlet and Arrival at Moonhaven (Session 28): Sensed a trail of Fey magic with his mask, leading the party into a high-speed chase through a spider-infested forest.

        *   The Prophecy of the Fae King (Session 29): Used *Alter Self* and a water breathing syringe to explore the submerged city of Moonhaven. Guided the party through the ruins using the fey pulse from his mask. Discovered a massive, prophetic mural in the holy district of Calathiel and, upon touching a specific carving, was plunged into an unconscious state for five hours.

The runes for his enchantments were physically carved into his bleeding flesh. The dream confirmed he has a violent, physically powerful older brother named Victor, and that their mentor was preparing them for a single, mysterious "goal."

Explored ancient ruins: investigated carvings (Nat 20), created pry bars with Magical Tinkering, failed to lift stone door, used Plasma Sword's "Unstoppable" feature to cut hole in stone door, lit torch, attempted to drink random cup (stopped by Kaladen), drank from green cup. Offered Kaladen a drumstick from chest cavity.
        *   Mind Flayer Encounter in Ancient Ruins (Session 19): Noted cup puzzle mechanism's outcome. Used Plasma Sword to illuminate underwater mural. Expressed skepticism about Zariel's "good feeling." In combat: summoned Steel Defender (stunned for most of fight); cast *Magic Stone*; attacked Mind Flayer Arcanist with Plasma Sword, breaking its *Telekinesis*; failed save vs Mind Blast (stunned, 30 psychic damage); grappled by Mind Flayer; targeted by *Dominate Monster* (failed Wisdom save); under domination, feigned enthusiasm and walked into brine pool; made Nat 20 Dexterity save against parasite worm (crushed in gears, immune due to Warforged nature); domination broken by parasite worm attack; rendered aid to Wesley (pulled from pool, administered Potion of Greater Healing, crushed parasite); attacked with *Magic Stone* (Nat 20) and Plasma Sword; attacked Intellect Devourer with *Firebolt*.

        *   Alliance and the Vault of the Wildfolk (Session 20): Welcomed newcomers Cletus and Cyrus, comically "drinking" almond milk which leaked from his armor.

Crafted a set of Thieves' Tools for Cyrus. Used *Expeditious Retreat* to rush to Kaladen and Zariel's aid, arriving dramatically just as their fight concluded.
        *   Completion of the Vault of the Wildfolk (Session 21): Cast *Alarm* to secure rests. Remained cautious outside the "Blood Room." Perceived the final orb key (#10) in the blood's reflection with a critical Investigation check. In the final battle, his Steel Defender was destroyed, but he landed a massive critical hit with his Searing Saber and delivered the killing blow to the Astral Stone Chimera by launching a floor tile with *Catapult*. Passed a mysterious Charisma saving throw.
        *   Defeat of the Elder Brain (Session 22): Was turned into a normal-sized but incredibly strong ape by a misfired *Polymorph*, proceeding to obliterate one Mind Flayer with a thrown rock. After reverting, he used high-level spells to burn through the Elder Brain's Legendary Resistances before delivering the killing blow in a spectacular final strike with his Searing Saber. Harvested parts from the Elder Brain's corpse.

Cast a crucial *Faerie Fire* on the Fire Spirit, granting advantage to the party for much of the fight. His Steel Defender was destroyed. Was knocked unconscious twice, surviving the first time by using his *All or Nothing Coin* on a death save, and the second time when his *Porcelain Doll* activated, preventing his death. The doll's consumption plunged him into a vision of a death-like plane where he approached the Baba Yaga's hut, revealing a potential method to contact her.
        *   Backstory Revelations & Wilderness Combat (Session 25): Prototyped the almond-exploding rifle for Chip, resulting in a minor explosion that singed the squirrel's eyebrows. During a long rest, experienced a vivid, traumatic memory of his past as an elven teen, being brutally trained by a harsh mentor alongside his violent brother, Victor. Fought Gnolls and a T-Rex, using *Ray of Frost* and *Blur*, while directing his Steel Defender. Discovered that his Searing Saber and Steel Defender's power cores are now mysteriously linked and growing in power.

Contributed to the party losing a day of travel with a failed Survival check. In combat with an Adult Black Dragon, served as a primary melee damage dealer with his Searing Saber. During a long rest, successfully integrated a Phoenix Feather into his Steel Defender's armor with a Nat 20 tinkering check, granting it fire resistance. Began work on adding harvested dragon hide to the armor.
        *   Pragmatism and Execution in the Forest (Session 27): Comically processed a diamond into dust for Zariel using his internal mechanisms. Contributed to solving the amethyst dragon statue puzzle by cutting its chain with his Searing Saber, but was thrown 50 feet by the resulting blast. Failed an enchanting check to add dragon hide to his Steel Defender, spending the night creating blueprints instead. In combat with Emery Razorback, his spells proved ineffective, but he delivered the non-lethal knockout blow. Showed a new ruthless streak by taunting the captured Gnoll general and then summarily executing him via decapitation when he refused to cooperate.
        *   The Spider Gauntlet and Arrival at Moonhaven (Session 28): Used *Detect Magic* to confirm Kaladen's fey trail. Survived a harrowing spider chase using a rocket-skate flavored *Expeditious Retreat* and a timely *Shield* spell. Accidentally awakened a massive Asteroid Spider with *Burning Hands*. During a long rest, ingeniously designed and built a complex, timed, automatic feeder for Zariel's pups using his Glutton's Fork and artificer skills.
        *   Lore and Discovery in Moonhaven (Session 29): During the underwater exploration of Moonhaven, he successfully recalled the names and nature-themed purposes of all six of the city's districts with a critical History check (Nat 20). He identified the bioluminescent fungi in the spider tunnels as being native to the Feywild. While the party waited for Kaladen to awaken from his vision, he found and collected a miraculously preserved, unidentified magic scroll from a waterlogged desk and made progress on integrating dragon hide into his Steel Defender's armor.

During a brutal fight with a Vrock where Kaladen was stunned and severely wounded, Zariel cast a crucial *Healing Spirit*, transformed into his metallic bear form, and dealt the killing blow by ripping the Vrock's wings off.

        *   Defeat of the Elder Brain (Session 22): Cast a misfired *Polymorph* on Leopold, creating a small but powerful ape. With a critical Arcana check (Nat 20), he deciphered the Elder Brain's Psionic Battery mechanic, giving the party the key to victory. Used *Heat Metal* to disrupt the batteries and summoned a horde of bats that dealt significant damage. Pushed his limits by using two Stress Points (now 7 total) to maintain his concentration against the Elder Brain's psionic attacks.
        *   Rescue and Travel to Cottonwood (Session 23): After the Elder Brain's defeat, looted 150gp in gems from the lair. Stabilized the unconscious Wesley with *Spare the Dying*. Proposed and executed a plan to travel to the village of Cottonwood by Wild Shaping into a Giant Eagle, shortening a six-day journey to two days. In a cliffside battle, used *Thunderwave* for crowd control and heavily damaged a Kobold scout with *Poison Spray*.
        *   Saving Cottonwood (Session 24): Cast *Pass Without Trace* to enable the entire party to sneak past a large Gnoll army.

Provided key healing with *Healing Word*. Was gifted the powerful Guardian Death Cap Spear by Cornelius as a reward.
        *   Forest Encounters and New Power (Session 25): Found his bond with his werewolf pups had weakened due to his absence. In a Gnoll ambush, cast *Conjure Animals* to summon eight wolves, which annihilated the threat. In a subsequent fight, Wild Shaped into a Tyrannosaurus Rex to battle another one, dealing massive damage before losing concentration. Healed the near-death Cletus with *Healing Word*. During a rest, the Embered Mane relic hatched into a powerful flaming cloak, which he claimed, learning it was the relic of a cursed General from the West Dome.
        *   Identity Revealed in the Blood Forest (Session 26): Leveled up to 9. A critically failed navigation check (Nat 1) cost the party a full day of travel.

In the ensuing fight, he used the power of his Embered Mane cloak for the first time to Wild Shape into a powerful Fire Elemental. During a long rest, he experienced a vivid dream of his past life as "Commander Zero," a high-ranking automaton in the West Dome city of Isoptera, serving a powerful orange-haired elven master.
        *   Curing the Curse and Contact from an Enemy (Session 27): After being warned of an impending full moon, successfully cast *Greater Restoration* on himself, curing his lycanthropy. This severed the magical bond with the werewolf pups, but they chose to remain with him out of trust and affection. Received a *Sending* spell from Lord Marshall Thurr, who pleaded for the return of "his daughter's children" (the pups) and revealed that the civil war in New New Arbor has entered a ceasefire. In combat, he Wild Shaped into a flaming bear and served as a powerful front-line fighter.
        *   The Spider Gauntlet and Arrival at Moonhaven (Session 28): Cast *Fire Shield* and used *Freedom of the Winds* to save a webbed Cletus during a frantic chase. Expended both Wild Shape uses to become a Fire Elemental, serving as a powerful tank and protector for the group. Rescued a heavily damaged Cyrus, carrying him to safety. After the chase, he made the difficult but pragmatic decision to leave the werewolf pups in a specially prepared, magically-fed den before the party entered Moonhaven.
        *   Guardian of the Resting Place (Session 29): As a Warforged, he required no magic to breathe underwater during the infiltration of Moonhaven. Acted as a silent guardian, providing his Pocket Workshop as a safe haven for the party to take an extended rest while hidden within the city's spider tunnels. After Cletus's Wild Shape expired, he took over spider-scout duties to maintain the party's Web Sense advantage.

        *   (Session 22): Proved to be the strategic MVP of the fight. His repeated and repositioned casting of *Moonbeam* was the primary tool for destroying the Elder Brain's Psionic Batteries. Was grappled and nearly killed by a Mind Flayer's "Extract Brain" ability. Used his first-ever Stress Point to automatically succeed on a saving throw against *Dominate Monster*. Also summoned a Spirit Totem (Hawk) to grant the party advantage.
        *   (Session 23): Found a sense of belonging in the animal-folk village of Cottonwood. Acted as the party's diplomat with the shaman Cornelius, offering gifts and accepting a quest to protect the town. Used *Moonbeam* and killed a Kobold with his spear in a roadside ambush. Wild Shaped into a Giant Eagle to help transport the party.
        *   (Session 24): Aided the fight against the corrupted Fire Spirit by summoning two Giant Vultures and casting *Spirit Totem (Bear)* to provide a temporary HP buffer for the party. Dealt consistent damage with *Moonbeam*. Was knocked unconscious by the spirit's breath weapon but healed by allies. Was gifted a new magical gnarled wooden staff from Cornelius as a reward for completing the quest.
        *   (Session 25): Attuned to his new Staff of the Woodlands. Used its ability to form a healing bond with Leopold via a roasted almond. In combat, cast a powerful 4th-level *Moonbeam* against a T-Rex. Was brutally grappled and mauled by the T-Rex, being knocked unconscious and near death before being healed by Zariel. After the difficult day, used his staff to summon a protective willow tree (functioning as a Tiny Hut) to provide the party a safe long rest.
        *   (Session 26): Leveled up to 9. Renewed his staff's bond with Cyrus by offering him a soggy, spit-covered almond from his squirrel, Chip. In combat against an Adult Black Dragon, he summoned four comically effective Satyrs (the "Rizzlers") who landed multiple critical hits. Was later targeted by Zariel's *Polymorph* and transformed into a Giant Ape. After several failed attacks, he landed the spectacular killing blow on the fleeing dragon with a thrown rock, causing him to level up on the spot.
        *   (Session 27): Cast a crucial *Dispel Magic* at a high DC to break the magical lock on the amethyst dragon statue, enabling the party to receive a boon, though he took 66 force damage from the resulting explosion. Summoned his Satyrs ("The Rizzlers") to great effect against Emery Razorback. Showcased his new Cleric multiclass abilities by casting a powerful *Blight* on the enemy Wyvern and *Guiding Bolt* on Razorback. Rolled a Natural 1 on a Survival check, costing the party another day of travel.
        *   The Spider Gauntlet and Arrival at Moonhaven (Session 28): Critically failed an attempt to cast *Animal Friendship* on a spider. Proved instrumental in the party's survival by casting *Longstrider* and summoning eight allied Giant Wolf Spiders which acted as a rearguard. Was trapped in a web and rescued by Zariel. Used his staff to create a *Tiny Hut* for a safe rest, and *Mold Earth* to build a kennel. Wild Shaped into a Giant Octopus to prepare for underwater infiltration.
        *   Hive Navigator and Scout (Session 29): Began the session as a Giant Octopus, using his strength to force open the doors to the Calathiel district. Identified the air-filled spider webs as a potential refuge. Later, Wild Shaped into a Giant Wolf Spider, using his Web Sense ability to map the entire city-spanning spider hive. He successfully identified a safe route to Kaladen's objective, bypassing thousands of zombie-like spiders and a massive central creature he dubbed the "spider mommy."

*   **Cyrus Schwert** *Race/Class:* Half-Elf Bard (College of Swords)
    *   Current Level: 9
    *   Key Items:

        *   Numbered Orbs (#9, #4): Stone keys collected from the Vault of the Wildfolk (Session 20).
        *   Psionic Aegis: (Legendary Wondrous Item, Attuned) A sleek, iridescent metal circlet with an opalescent gem. Grants resistance to psychic damage, shields the wearer's mind from psychic intrusion, and allows for a telekinetic shove ability. Claimed after defeating the guardian of the Vault of the Wildfolk. Its aura of psionic invisibility was crucial for infiltrating the Mind Flayer lair (Session 22).
        *   Vegan Leather Sidebag (Purchased Session 23).
        *   Blessing of the Gemstone Drakes: Magical boon gained from freeing an amethyst dragon statue. Once per day, as a reaction, can cast the *Shield* spell. (Obtained Session 27, used via retcon in Session 28 to survive an otherwise fatal onslaught).
    *   Notable Traits & Events:
        *   A lanky, seemingly inept farmhand working for Cletus Cobbington, who only hired him as a favor to his father. Initially complains about work and seems unsuited for farm life. Discovered he grew up in the same Sweets District of New New Arbor as Kaladen.
        *   Witnessed the werewolf attack on New New Arbor and fled with Cletus.
        *   Teleported to the northern wilderness by "Ratchet" (Ratshit). Was drawn to the ancient ruins by a "nice voice" (confirmed as the same dangerous Mind Flayer lure the O'dears experienced).
        *   Met the O'dears and, despite initial fear, became extremely enthusiastic about becoming an "adventurer."
        *   Revealed surprising and formidable skill in combat, landing multiple critical hits with his scimitar and later the "Peacemaker" sword. Dealt killing blows to a Chasme, a Shadow Demon, and a Quasit.
        *   Showed a talent for lockpicking, successfully picking a series of seven complex locks with assistance from the party, proving his value beyond combat.
        *   Supports allies with Bardic Inspiration. Is developing rapidly from a naive farmhand into a brave, if excitable, adventurer.
        *   (Session 21): Accidentally alerted two Chasmes, initiating a difficult fight. Fought his blood clone in the "Blood Room." In the final battle against the Astral Stone Chimera, used a Defensive Flourish to raise his AC to 24, avoiding multiple attacks. Was entrusted with and attuned to the Psionic Aegis.
        *   (Session 22): His Psionic Aegis was instrumental in allowing the party to sneak through the Mind Flayer lair. He played a key support and skirmisher role, using Bardic Inspiration, killing Mind Flayer brutes with his Peacemaker sword, and briefly neutralizing one with *Calm Emotions*. Was stunned by the Elder Brain's Mind Blast.
        *   (Session 23): Fully embraced his violent adventurer persona ("We're taking ears and making dollars."). Interacted with locals in Cottonwood, buying a new bag and a bottle of prune juice which he gifted to the shaman Cornelius. In combat, proved highly effective, killing two Kobold scouts with his swords.
        *   (Session 24): Used *Enhance Ability* to aid the party's stealth past a Gnoll army. Eagerly volunteered to be polymorphed by Zariel into a Giant Ape, serving as the party's primary tank and dealing massive melee damage. His impulsive attempt to restrain the Fire Spirit caused it to transform into its more dangerous, fully-flamed form. Later in the fight, cast *Phantasmal Killer*.
        *   (Session 25): Proved to be a creative and mobile combatant during the journey through the Chiari Rung Forest. He climbed onto a house roof to kill a Gnoll, used *Gust* and a *Wind Wall* for battlefield control, and provided Kaladen with Bardic Inspiration. Fought bravely in melee against both Gnolls and a T-Rex.
        *   (Session 26): Leveled up to 9. Grudgingly renewed his bond with Cletus by eating a soggy almond. In combat against an Adult Black Dragon, he used *Wind Wall* for battlefield control, dealt significant melee damage, and used *Phantasmal Killer* to burn one of the dragon's Legendary Resistances. Experienced a vivid dream of his youth, where his friend Eryn Door passed him a forbidden book about adventurers exploring the "Ashen Grove" near the "Tree of Death." Kaladen was mysteriously present in his dream.
        *   (Session 27): Was the first to notice the whimsical ringing that led the party to the amethyst dragon statue clearing. Aided Kaladen's successful enchanting with *Enhance Ability*. Confirmed with Kaladen that he was aware of his presence in his dream, deepening the mystery of their connection. In combat against Emery Razorback, he focused on the Gnoll's Wyvern mount, landing a massive critical hit that killed the beast instantly by snapping its spine.
        *   The Spider Gauntlet and Arrival at Moonhaven (Session 28): Provided a crucial party-wide buff with *Enhance Ability*. Made a heroic stand against a massive Asteroid Spider, landing a critical hit and slowing it with the Slasher feat. This drew the ire of the entire spider horde, and he was nearly killed before being rescued by Zariel. Survived the onslaught by retroactively using his *Shield* boon. Was polymorphed into a large, colorful (periwinkle-and-pink) Giant Crab for the infiltration of Moonhaven.
        *   Communications Hub in Crisis (Session 29): Began the session polymorphed as a Giant Crab, using his perception to spot the "Mithilorn District" sign in the underwater gloom. Was the first to suggest entering the spider-web structures to find air. At the end of the session, he was the sole recipient of a series of frantic *Sending* spells from Ratshit, faithfully relaying the shocking news of Calmera Windrider's military coup in New New Arbor to the rest of the party.

    *   **(Session 22 Revelation):** Revealed to be the male Alpha Werewolf, mate to the female Alpha the party killed in Session 16. His "sudden leave of absence" was a lie. In a fit of rage over his mate's death, he took control of the city's werewolf packs and launched a full-scale assault on New New Arbor, starting a civil war.
    *   **(Session 27 Update):** Contacted Zariel via a *Sending* spell after sensing Zariel had cured his lycanthropy. Confirmed the werewolf pups are the offspring of his mate and pleaded for their safe return. He also revealed that active fighting in New New Arbor has ceased, but warned that the city the party left is gone, implying a new, tense political situation.
    *   *(Status: Major Antagonist. His civil war led to chaos that was exploited by Calmera Windrider, who staged a military coup. His current status and whereabouts following the coup are unknown.)*

Examined Leopold's recharged Blackguard Knight power core, noting its advanced, "necromantic-like" (life force) nature (party, not Leopold, saw "KW" initials etched on it). After tense negotiation facilitated by Kaladen, formally agreed to Leopold's apprenticeship. Agreed to craft dragon scale armor for Kaladen and standard Omen Knight gear for Ratshit (including a custom Ring of Frost cup holder). Provided intel on Calmera Windrider (from North Dome, "douche," advancer not inventor).
    *   **(Session 15 Update):** Confirmed Kaladen's dragon scale armor piece would be ready soon. Agreed to craft a Ring of Protection +1 for Zariel (1000g). DM noted price might have been better if party hadn't "burned bridge" over Leopold's power core. Zariel picked up the ring in Session 16.

Was highly impressed by Leopold's self-constructed Plasma Sword, officially confirming his apprenticeship. Allowed Leopold to take scrap metal. Mentioned a large Legionnaire order she was working on. *(Status: Unknown. Her fate following the military coup led by Calmera Windrider is unconfirmed.)*
*   **Zariel's Elven Master / Leopold's Mentor:** Powerful high elf mage with shoulder-length, curly orange hair and vibrant blue eyes. Wears flowing blue robes. Appears in visions/memories as Zariel's creator/commander and Leopold's harsh, abusive mentor. He subjected a young, elven Leopold to torturous training (carving runes into his flesh) and prepared both Leopold (for arcane perfection) and his violent brother Victor (for physical perfection) for a single, mysterious "goal." He threatened to replace Victor's brain with a power core, foreshadowing the nature of the Blackguards.
    *   **(Session 26 Revelation):** A dream from Zariel confirmed this individual was his commander in the West Dome city of Isoptera around the year 222 PDC. The master was engaged in clandestine activities, ordering Zariel ("Commander Zero") to lie and provide an alibi that he was visiting a "Lord Kalmara in Philantera."
    *   *(Status: Historical figure from Zariel's and Leopold's past, last seen in a dream memory leaving the West Dome on a secret mission. Current whereabouts and status unknown.)*
*   **Mysterious Entity / Kaladen's "Fun Uncle":** A powerful, unnamed entity. Previously appeared in shadowy, arachnid forms.
    *   **(Session 11 Revelation):** Manifested through transformed Cedric. Spoke to Kaladin, claimed blood relationship, stated it was "sealed" and now "out." Tasked Kaladin with analyzing Legionnaires and finding it later.

He claimed to be Kaladen's distant relative ("fun uncle"), tied to him at the soul. Revealed he is an ancient being from "before the Induven" who was banished to the Astral Sea by a "First Council." He encouraged Kaladen to embrace the Isoptic Curse as a "gift" of great power and warned him not to trust the Council's legacy.
    *   *(Status: Active, imprisoned in the Astral Sea, communicating with Kaladen through dreams. His motives are to guide/manipulate Kaladen and oppose the legacy of the "First Council." Nature and goals still largely unknown.)*
*   **Selena Sal:** Eccentric, seemingly ancient potion shop owner (Storm District). Huge goggles, messy bun, patchwork muumuu. Potentially senile or feigning it. Has a talking hermit crab, Marcel. Her shop contains the hidden entrance to the Fungal Tunnels. Her involvement/awareness remains unknown. *(Not encountered Session 2-29)*.
*   **Lancex the Fungal Guardian:** Former Stonewall Legionnaire assimilated and mutated into a powerful Myconid Sovereign variant. His club's magic was transferred to Kaladin's weapon. *(Status: Deceased/Destroyed)*
*   **Mysterious Woman on Altar / Faye Lara:** Young, fair-skinned woman with dirty brown hair. Her life-sustaining glass mask ("Breath of the Feywild") was stolen by Cedric (Session 10), causing her to turn to stone. The mask was recovered by Kaladin (Session 11) and, when donned by him (Session 12), induced a vision of a fey woman named Faye Lara (almost certainly the woman herself) in the Feywild. The vision caused Kaladin's physical transformation and she hinted at a shared past.
    *   **(Session 14 Update):** Lord Marshall Thurr stated he will contact the "High Healer" to see if her petrification can be reversed. This plan is now defunct due to Thurr's betrayal.
    *   **(Session 25 Update):** Appeared to Kaladen in a powerful dream, standing on a cliff overlooking the shattered, flooding North Dome of Moonhaven. She told him, "There you'll find who you are," before her form dissipated into wildflowers on the wind, directly linking his personal quest to the party's main objective.
    *   **(Session 29 Update):** Her voice was heard at the start of Kaladen's prophetic vision, reiterating that he would discover his identity in Moonhaven. The vision revealed the goddess Jeya, a potential ancestor or source of Faye Lara's power.
    *   *(Status: "Dead in a traditional sense" but serves as Kaladen's spiritual guide via dreams and his mask; physical body petrified. Connection to Kaladen established.)*
*   **Blackguard Knight (Deactivated Warforged):** Extremely imposing figure in sleek, all-black armor with jagged pauldrons and an enormous greatsword. Formerly deployed by Thurr. Leopold felt "click" of recognition.

    *   **(Session 17 Update):** Leopold confirmed the salvaged body is an advanced version of his own design. He also realized "Victor" was inscribed in tinkering runes on the "KW" power core. *(Status: Deactivated. Body (missing one power core, which is with Leopold) and greatsword recovered by party. Likely defeated by werewolf. Linked to Calmera Windrider and Leopold's brother Victor.)*
*   **Unnamed Posh Nobleman:** Arrogant participant in Legionnaire tryouts; Kaladin's opponent. Revealed he was cursed, transformed into a Fire Elemental. *(Status: Deceased/Destroyed as Fire Elemental)*

*   **Sylvaris Sunseeker (Omen Knight - Retired/Part-Time Guard):** Tall, elven-heritage man with long platinum hair and platinum armor. Task force ambushed. Assisted party. Evacuated Ratchet. Retired.
    *   **(Session 15 Update):** Encountered guarding the Omen Knight Fort. Discussed his "retirement," grief for his lost team (Laser, Blazer, Taser), and mentioned Ratshit's Omen Knight status might be tenuous ("soft tissue... probably won't make it"). Pointed party to their room and new CO Leora Wagnar. Works at "Sunny Days" grocery store (owned by his father). *(Status: Unknown.

Office is lavish with lemongrass-scented fountains and advanced automatons. Plaque reads "Lord of Advancement KW." Described by Hamhawk as a "fucking douche" from the North Dome (before it went silent), a genius at advancing tech but not inventing.
    *   **Role & Objectives:** Former member of the High Council. Has seized control of New New Arbor in a military coup, declared martial law, and deployed a personal army of advanced Warforged soldiers. The fate of the previous First Council under his rule is unknown.
    *   **Key Interactions (Session 14):** Summoned Leopold and Zariel. Examined Leopold invasively, asserting Leopold was "just a suit of armor." His Blackguard Knight (referred to as "Victor too") blocked Leopold's attempt to leave. Revealed by Thurr to be fixated on Leopold's form. The "KW" initials on his plaque match those on Leopold's salvaged Blackguard power core (now powering Leopold's plasma sword, *and inscribed with "Victor" in tinkering runes, realized Session 17*). Leopold's memories from Session 25 of a harsh mentor preparing him and his brother Victor for a "goal" cast Calmera's interest in a new, more ominous light.
    *   *(Status: Primary Antagonist. De facto ruler of New New Arbor following his military coup. Commands a personal army of Warforged. Has a hidden agenda concerning Leopold, advanced Warforged, and potentially his brother Victor. Actively has the party under surveillance.)*

Bit and infected Kaladen with lycanthropy.
    *   *(Status: Deceased. Killed by Kaladen's *Chromatic Orb* in Session 16. Corpse recovered by Zariel and stored in Pocket Workshop (Session 17). Her death directly caused Lord Marshall Thurr to launch a civil war against New New Arbor.)*

*   **Festival Attack and Rise of "The Hand of God":** During a public festival, a monstrous werewolf attacked Legionnaires outside the dome while extremist cultists, "The Hand of God," launched a coordinated assault from within. The party defended citizens and neutralized several cultists, revealing a dangerous new internal threat.
*   **Revelation and Defeat of 'The Reverend' & City-Wide Cult Uprising (Session 9 & 10):** Infiltrating the Hand of God's base, the party confronted High Cleric Father Kallor, revealed as "The Reverend," the cult's fanatical leader. Kallor transformed into a powerful angelic being. The party, with aid from an injured Sylvaris Sunseeker, defeated The Reverend. Simultaneously, the cult launched a massive, coordinated city-wide uprising, wiping out an Omen Knight task force and attacking Legionnaire Core.
*   **Theft of the Fey Woman's Mask and Her Petrification (Session 10):** While the party battled The Reverend, Cedric (Hand of God scouter) led an attack on the Legionnaire Med Bay. He stole the Mysterious Fey Woman's life-sustaining mask, causing her to instantly turn to stone. Cedric escaped.
*   **Pursuit of Cedric, Mask Recovery, and Emergence from the Dome (Session 11):** The party tracked the transformed Cedric into a subterranean cave system. After a fierce battle, during which a mysterious, powerful entity spoke to Kaladin through Cedric, they defeated Cedric and recovered the Fey Woman's mask.

*   **Revelations Outside the Dome: The Blackguard Knight's True Nature and Kaladin's Fey Awakening (Session 12):** While investigating the Arcane Splitter site, the party discovered the deactivated Blackguard Knight, revealed to be an advanced Warforged bearing Leopold's "Bone Crusher" emblem.

*   **Discovery of a Mana Wellspring and Defeat of its Dragon Guardian (Session 13):** The party navigated subterranean caverns to discover a lava-filled cave network.

*   **Return to HQ, Omen Knight Promotions, and Ominous Revelations (Session 14):** The party (Kaladen, Leopold, Zariel) and their former handler Ratshit (Donnie Farsight) were all promoted to Omen Knight rank by Lord Marshall Thurr. Kaladen received a prophetic dream from the Mysterious Entity. Zariel experienced a memory-dream of his elven master. Leopold faced unsettling scrutiny from the Lord of Advancement Calmera Windrider, who showed intense interest in his "Bone Crusher" emblem and referred to his own Blackguard Knight as "Victor too." Initials "KW" (Calmera Windrider's) were found on Leopold's salvaged power core, linking Calmera to advanced Warforged technology. The party received new magic items and a new mission to hunt lycanthropes.
*   **Lycanthrope Infestation & Zariel's True Form (Session 15):** As new Omen Knights, the party investigated a lycanthrope outbreak in the Storm District. They defeated two werecreatures in a subterranean tunnel network, learning of "syringes" possibly used to spread the curse. Pursued by a horde, they battled a formidable Alpha Werewolf. During this fight, Zariel, near death, experienced a vision of his creator and transformed, shedding his outer shell to reveal a larger, metallic "True Form," healing him. The party managed a desperate escape after Kaladen used a stress point to collapse a walkway, sending the Alpha into a pit.
*   **Defeat of the Storm District Alpha Werewolf & Kaladen's Transformation (Session 16):** After further preparation, the O'Dears returned to the lycanthrope den and trapped the female Alpha Werewolf. A brutal fight ensued, culminating in the Alpha's defeat by Kaladen. During the battle, Kaladen was bitten and infected with lycanthropy. He self-amputated his infected arm and consumed his Potion of Soulwood Prosthesis, causing a new, magical limb to begin growing. Two werewolf pups were spared.
*   **Civil War and Military Coup in New New Arbor (Revealed Session 22, 27 & 29):** In the days following the party's departure, Lord Marshall Thurr retaliated for his mate's death by launching a werewolf civil war.

He has declared martial law, deployed a private army of advanced Warforged, and the fate of the First Council is unknown.
*   **Expedition to the North Dome & Wilderness Arrival (Session 17):** After a period of recovery and downtime, the O'Dears accepted a perilous mission to investigate the damaged North Dome. They were teleported to an unknown, dense wilderness far to the north, where their comms failed, and they immediately encountered hostile monsters.
*   **Alliance with Wesley & Exploration of Ancient Northern Ruins (Session 18):** After surviving an ambush, the O'Dears encountered Wesley, a Harengon psionicist. He enlisted their aid to find his missing friends, leading them to unexplored ancient stone ruins. Guided by Zariel's dream, the party began to unravel the ruin's secrets.
*   **Completion of the Vault of the Wildfolk (Session 21):** The party overcame the final trials of the Vault of the Wildfolk, including demonic ambushes and the "Face Yourself" puzzle, to collect ten keys. They then defeated the vault's final guardian, an Astral Stone Chimera, and claimed the Psionic Aegis, a legendary circlet created as a weapon against the Illithids.
*   **Defeat of the Elder Brain (Session 22):** Upon discovering their ally Wesley had been abducted, the party re-entered the Mind Flayer lair. They confronted the colony's leader, a powerful Elder Brain, in its throne room. After a grueling tactical battle where they discovered and destroyed its "Psionic Battery" minions, the party vanquished the Elder Brain, neutralizing the Mind Flayer threat in the ruins.
*   **Mercy for a Corrupted God & Defense of Cottonwood (Session 24):** After bypassing a Gnoll army, the O'dears confronted the "fire creature" on a volcanic peak. They learned it was a benevolent spirit corrupted by a cult. After a brutal battle, the party defeated the creature, an act of mercy that also caused the Gnoll army to scatter, saving the village of Cottonwood. Leopold's near-death in the fight triggered a vision of the Baba Yaga, revealing a potential path to the enigmatic hag.
*   **Infiltration of the Shattered City of Moonhaven (Session 28-29):** After surviving a harrowing chase through a spider-infested forest, the party arrived at and began their infiltration of Moonhaven. They discovered the city to be a tiered, submerged ruin infested with a massive spider colony. Navigating via a network of air-filled web tunnels, they found a prophetic mural that plunged Kaladen into a 5-hour vision, revealing the secret history of the continent and a ritual for him to potentially become a Fae King.

*   **Isoptera (The West Dome):** A high-tech city of circular platforms and glass walkways built into the side of a cliff. Zariel's city of origin, seen in a dream memory from the year 222 PDC. Confirmed as the source of the Cursed War. *(Encountered in dream Session 26)*
*   **The Astral Sea (Dreamscape):** An infinite, empty void space where Kaladen was pulled during a dream. Contains a "glass palace" of black, opaque glass platforms and walkways. Serves as the prison/domain of Kaladen's ancient fey-elf relative. *(Encountered in dream Session 27)*
*   **Amethyst Dragon Statue Clearing (Chiari Rung Forest):** A large clearing dominated by a 15-foot amethyst dragon statue and surrounding crystals. Site of a puzzle that, when solved, released a blast of energy and granted the party a magical boon ("Blessing of the Gemstone Drakes"). *(Discovered Session 27)*
*   **The Shattered City of Moonhaven (North Dome):** A massive, domed elven and fey city, now a "haunting relic." The arcane dome has a huge, open crack on its southwest edge. The lower half of the city is completely submerged in a vast, unnaturally-formed lake, with water actively being pulled into the crack from a nearby river. The upper, unsubmerged half is completely overrun by the jungle. The city is built in tiered, nature-themed districts (Mithilorn, Silphane, Larendel, Calathiel). *(Discovered Session 28, explored Session 29)*
    *   **The Spider-Web Air Tunnels:** An intricate, city-spanning network of tunnels constructed from thick spider silk, suspended underwater.

Serves as both a safe passage and the nest of a massive spider colony. *(Discovered Session 29)*
    *   **The Prophetic Mural of Calathiel:** A massive, 50-foot wall of carvings in a submerged building in the holy Calathiel district. It depicts the history of the goddess Jeya and the Induven people, and contains a hidden, magical prophecy that acts as a trigger for Kaladen's visions. *(Discovered Session 29)*

## Ongoing Mysteries & Goals

*   What is the full nature, origin, and range of effects of the Isoptic Curse? (Note: Kaladin's fey transformation, Soulwood arm. Zariel's transformed arm, "True Form". Cletus's Firbolg/cow form. The Fire Spirit was a cursed General. The fall of Isoptera is the source of the Cursed War. Kaladen's ancient relative has framed it as a "gift" of power. Session 29 vision revealed a prophecy for Kaladen to become a Fae King, a potential apotheosis of his curse.)
*   What are the details surrounding Zariel's memory loss and 'accident'? (Note: Warforged nature confirmed. Visions of elven creator/mentor. Session 26: A vivid dream revealed his identity as 'Commander Zero,' a high-ranking automaton from the West Dome city of Isoptera, circa 222 PDC. He served a powerful, orange-haired elven master (Leopold's mentor) and was ordered to lie about his master leaving the dome on a secret mission.)
*   What happened during Leopold's past? (Note: Session 25: A vivid dream revealed he was once a full-blooded elf with a violent, powerful brother named Victor, both trained by an abusive mentor for a "goal." This mentor also commanded Zariel. Session 29: The coup by Calmera Windrider, deploying an army of his own Warforged, makes the threat of Leopold's past immediate and personal.)
*   What is the nature of Kaladen's connection to the Feywild/past lives? (Note: Vision of Faye Lara. Session 27: A powerful fey-elf "uncle" revealed they are tied at the soul. Session 29: A massive prophetic vision detailed the history of the goddess Jeya and a ritual for Kaladen to become the next Fae King, solidifying his destiny is tied to the fey realm's highest powers.)
*   What are the potential consequences or drawbacks of using Stress Points? (Note: Kaladin 6 used, Leopold 4 used, Zariel 7 used, Cletus 1 used. Zariel's arm transformation occurred alongside gaining a stress point. Leopold used 2 to overcome fear.)
*   Who was the figure Kaladin saw watching him before the tryouts? (Note: Mysterious Entity, Faye Lara. Session 13: Sensed dark presence. Session 14 & 27: Direct dream communication with the entity.)
*   What is the significance of Zariel's red-tipped orchid?
*   How common is the Isoptic Curse? How is it perceived? (Note: Leora Wagnar is "just cursed" with lycanthropy, not Isoptic cursed. New PC Cletus is also afflicted.)
*   What is the true power structure of New New Arbor? (Note: It has completely collapsed. Calmera Windrider has staged a military coup, seized power, and deployed a Warforged army. The First Council is missing. Ratshit is a fugitive. The party's former allies and chain of command are gone or compromised.)
*   What is the significance of Captain Levi's meeting regarding another domed city?
*   What is the nature and origin of the Myconids in the Fungal Tunnels? What is their goal?
*   Where are the missing people from the Storm District? (Note: The city's collapse into civil war has made these original cases largely irrelevant.)
*   Is Selena Sal involved with, complicit in, or ignorant of the Myconid/Fey activity beneath her shop?
*   What is the significance of the small film reel Leopold received?
*   What will happen on Leopold's arranged "date" with Marcel the Hermit Crab?
*   Who/what is the mysterious woman found on the altar? (Note: Faye Lara. Mask ("Breath of the Feywild") attuned to Kaladin. Petrified. Thurr's betrayal means any planned healing is void. Now serves as Kaladin's spiritual guide. Her voice was heard again in the Session 29 vision.)
*   Who is the "he" that Lancex warned is "coming for her" (Faye Lara)? (Note: Mysterious Entity prime candidate.)
*   What is the full extent and origin of the Fey magic presence in the Fungal Tunnels? (Note: Kaladin's vision/transformation, fully formed Soulwood arm.)
*   What are the Omen Knights' specific roles, powers, and allegiances? (Note: All PCs are Omen Knights. Leora Wagnar was their CO. The Omen Knights' status under Calmera's new regime is unknown.)
*   What was the significance of the Albatross blood drawing ("one for sorrow") and subsequent Sylvan message ("Three for a wedding")? (Note: Session 14: New glyphs found in Reverend's Chapel complete a rhyme "One for sorrow, two for mirth, three for a wedding." Meaning still unclear.)
*   What truly happened to Moonhaven to cause its silence? (Note: The city is shattered, half-flooded by an unnatural water draw, and infested by a massive spider colony that has created a network of air-filled web tunnels.)
*   What is the full extent, leadership, and ultimate goal of "The Hand of God" cult? (Note: Leaders defeated. The remnants are likely scattered or absorbed into the city's chaos.)
*   Why did the Legionnaire medical facility feel "somewhat familiar" to Zariel? (Note: Warforged nature, "True Form" and creator visions. Shared mentor with Leopold. Confirmed origin in Isoptera's High Council.)
*   What is the significance of the recurring "metallic sheen" observed on Zariel? (Note: Warforged nature confirmed. Right arm now permanently visibly metallic. "True Form" is fully metallic.)
*   What was Cedric's exact role, power source, and motives? (Note: Conduit for Entity. Deceased.)
*   What is the origin and purpose of the mysterious yellow lubricant Zariel found on his knuckle?
*   Is the library scribe Victor Holloway connected in any way to Leopold's brother Victor? (Note: Leopold's brother confirmed as Victor. Calmera's "Victor too" comment adds new layer. Calmera's associate "Lord Kalmara" was mentioned by Zariel's master as a (likely false) alibi, further weaving these names together (Session 26).)
*   What is the true nature of Viteo's "wrath" aspect?
*   What was the alchemical substance in the cups in the "mass ritual/suicide" chamber?
*   Who is the "higher up" individual Omen Knight Laser saw bearing the "Bone Crusher" emblem? (Note: Calmera Windrider's strong reaction to the emblem, his possession of a Blackguard Knight, and the "KW" initials on Leopold's power core make him a prime suspect or closely related. *Leopold's discovery of "Victor" on "KW" core further strengthens this link, Session 17.*)
*   How can the Fey Woman (Faye Lara) be restored from her petrified state? (Note: Thurr's betrayal means any planned healing is void.)
*   What are the properties and significance of Kaladin's Light Splitter?
*   What are the functions and secrets of Zariel's Pocket Workshop?
*   What is the meaning of the "far north," "to the tree," and the "copper city" from Zariel's visions? (Note: The "Tree of Death" was identified by Cyrus from a forbidden book and named in Kaladen's prophetic vision as a key ritual location. The "copper city" could be Isoptera.)
*   What is the significance of Kaladin's dream of the fabric octagon, the golden wheat field, and voices of "rulers" and one "special"? (Note: Entity's claim of relation, Faye Lara connection, Session 14 entity dream.)
*   Who is the Mysterious Entity that spoke to Kaladin? What is its true nature, history, and ultimate goals? (Session 27: He has revealed himself in a dream as a 9-foot tall fey-elf, an ancient being from before the Induven who claims to be Kaladen's 'fun uncle'. He was banished to the Astral Sea by a 'First Council' and claims the Isoptic Curse is a gift.)
*   Why is the environment outside the Southern Dome pleasant and natural? Was official information deliberately misleading?
*   Why did the party's Legionnaire technology deactivate outside the dome? (Note: Functional again inside New New Arbor in Session 14. *Non-functional again in northern wilderness, Session 17-29.*)
*   What is the full story and origin of Faye Lara? What is her connection to Kaladin ("Cal")?
*   What are the full implications, abilities, and potential drawbacks of Kaladin's persistent fey transformation and his attunement to the "Breath of the Feywild" mask? (Note: Used for telepathy, and to sense a fey trail which successfully guided the party through Moonhaven. Fully formed Soulwood arm.)
*   What is the origin and significance of the "Bone Crusher" emblem and the faction it represents? (Session 14: Calmera's reaction, "KW" core, "Victor too" comment heavily link it to Calmera and Leopold's past. *Discovery of "Victor" on "KW" core and Leopold's elven past confirm deep connections, Session 17 & 25.*)
*   Who or what defeated the advanced Blackguard Knight at the Arcane Splitter site? (Note: Possibly the Alpha Werewolf or similar creature.)
*   What is the "godforsaken sphere" mentioned in Zariel's dream by his elven master?
*   What are the "forces determined to keep [the spidery entity] silenced about the truth of these blasted domes," as mentioned in Kaladen's dream?
*   What is the significance of the "syringes" mentioned by Terrence in relation to the lycanthropy outbreak?
*   Is Kaladen truly cured of lycanthropy after amputating his arm and using the Potion of Soulwood Prosthesis? *(Arm fully formed Session 17. Lycanthropy status post-amputation still technically unknown. Zariel cured his own lycanthropy with Greater Restoration in Session 27.)*
*   What is the full extent of Harengon society (e.g., "outpost of Cottonwood") and other sentient animal-folk civilizations in Avarias? *(Progress: The party has reached Cottonwood, a mixed animal-folk settlement founded by a Tortle.)*
*   What is the story behind Cletus's curse and his relationship with Cyrus's father?

Where can she be found? *(Session 24 update: Leopold experienced a near-death vision, transporting him to a liminal 'Ashen Expanse' where he saw her chicken-legged hut. He now theorizes that coming close to death is a way to reach her plane.)*
*   What are the properties and purpose of the magical relic, The Embered Mane? *(Hatched into a powerful cloak for Zariel in Session 25. Lore revealed it belonged to a cursed general from the West Dome.)*
*   What is the "one goal" that Leopold and Zariel's shared mentor was training them and Victor for? *(New - Session 25)*

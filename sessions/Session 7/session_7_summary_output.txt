The air in the Spit and Swallow, already thick with pipe smoke and stale ale, crackled with a new, potent energy. Our newly minted Legionnaires—Kaladin, the calculating wizard; Leopold, the enigmatic warforged; and Zariel, the fierce druid—had carved their way through the tavern's brutal hierarchy, each emerging victorious from the blood-soaked sand of the fighting pit. Their eyes, however, remained fixed on their true quarry: Cedric, the pit's champion, a man whose very presence whispered of the shadowy "Hand of God" cult they were sworn to investigate.

As the last cheers for Kaladin’s victory faded, Cedric, a man built like a stone bulwark, his fists wrapped in simple cloth, met their gaze. "Well, that was pretty interesting, actually," his voice cut through the lingering din. With an almost casual grace, he dropped into the pit. "Mind if I jump in?" The challenge hung heavy. Before the O’dears could even fully process the implications, a wave of unseen energy pulsed from Cedric, washing over them. Aches vanished, wounds mended, and a surge of new power coursed through their veins – they felt themselves ascend, stronger, sharper, now Level Four. The stakes were set: their lives, 500 gold, and the answers they desperately sought.

Kaladin, ever the tactician, wove shimmering duplicates of himself into existence with a quick *Mirror Image* even as Leopold, his metallic frame surprisingly agile, hopped into the pit to stand with his comrades. Zariel, after a brief, intense query about the terms – "So are we fighting all three against one? Or what are we doing?" – let loose a guttural roar, his form swelling and shifting into that of a massive, snarling Polar Bear.

The battle that ensued was a maelstrom of arcane power and brutal physicality. Cedric, an unnervingly stoic brawler, moved with deceptive speed. His initial assault on the bear was devastating; each blow landed with concussive force, followed by an unnerving, delayed pulse of radiant light that Zariel, even in his ursine fury, registered with a jolt. Leopold, momentarily gripped by an unnatural fear that rooted his feet, summoned his loyal Steel Defender, its gears whirring as it materialized behind the champion. Kaladin, meanwhile, invoked a *Bless* upon his allies, his spear leveled and ready.

The fight ebbed and flowed, a deadly dance in the sand. Zariel, as the polar bear, mauled Cedric, his claws tearing flesh, only to be battered back, reverting to his elven form under a punishing series of blows that might have felled a lesser warrior. Undeterred, he transformed anew, this time into a Giant Constrictor Snake, its coils wrapping around Cedric in a crushing embrace, briefly restraining the champion. Kaladin, weaving through the chaos, unleashed *Magic Missiles* and scorching *Firebolts*, his movements a blur thanks to a timely *Misty Step*. Leopold, his initial fear overcome, became a whirlwind of arcane firepower. His deployable crossbow sent bolts whistling, enchanted stones cracked against Cedric’s defenses, and a searing *Burning Hands* forced the champion to duck and weave. His Steel Defender, clanking and whirring, relentlessly harried Cedric’s flank, its force-empowered rends finding purchase.

But Cedric was no ordinary brawler. As the fight wore on, a terrifying change overcame him. His fists began to radiate a golden light, his veins pulsed with raw power, and his eyes took on a faint, menacing glow – a disquieting echo of the cursed Fire Elemental the party had faced during their Legionnaire tryouts. "His fists actually start radiating with like golden light," the DM might have intoned, "as he just starts to like his veins on his chest and his arms pulse with radiant energy." His attacks grew more ferocious, each miss seemingly fueling his rage, making his body glow brighter, more menacingly. Kaladin found himself squarely in the champion's sights, targeted with relentless, empowered strikes. His *Mirror Images* flickered and died, absorbing blow after savage blow. Twice, the wizard fell, only to be dragged back from the brink by Zariel’s desperate healing – first a *Healing Spirit* that blossomed like a spectral tree in the pit, then a timely *Healing Word*. Each time Kaladin was revived, however, Cedric’s curse took its toll, leaving the wizard with a chillingly halved maximum vitality.

The tide turned when Leopold, his voice a strange mix of mechanical calm and underlying panic – "Oh my God, quit hitting me!" – latched onto Cedric with a crackling *Witch Bolt*. The sustained torrent of lightning, coupled with a critical strike from his Steel Defender that landed with a sickening crunch of force, began to wear the transformed champion down. Zariel, though stunned multiple times, heroically managed to revive Kaladin once more. Finally, with Cedric visibly singed, his skin weeping from open wounds, Leopold unleashed one last, devastating surge from his *Witch Bolt*. "OH DEAR GOD, OH JESUS CHRIST!" he shrieked as a rack of lightning arced down, crisping the champion. Cedric fell to his knees, smoking and scorched, the light fading from his eyes, before collapsing face-first into the sand. The Spit and Swallow erupted.

In the aftermath, Cedric, surprisingly lucid despite his ordeal, conceded defeat. "Man, that was a good fight," he admitted, a few teeth notably absent. "I haven't been challenged like that in months." He apologized for his uncontrolled power surge, "I've never had that happen before... I felt almost beside my own body. It was surreal." He attributed his abilities to his devotion to the goddess Viteo, but when pressed about the Hand of God symbol, his demeanor shifted. He admitted to being a "scouter," finding talent and sending it to "religious type zealots" operating out of a chapel basement in the Don District. He offered Kaladin the curled-finger hand symbol as a token. "When I send people to them, I give them this to show... if you look less like Legionnaires, they might let you in." Leopold’s more pointed questions about direct cult involvement, however, caused Cedric to clam up, the warforged’s bluntness rubbing the champion the wrong way. Leopold astutely noticed that the fight had physically changed Cedric; the cloth wraps on his hands were gone, replaced by inlaid gold that seemed part of his very skin, a permanent mark of his curse.

Their purses heavier with winnings, the O’dears retreated to the Core, the weight of their encounter settling upon them. While Kaladin and Zariel sought immediate rest, Leopold, driven by a thirst for knowledge, ventured to the Core Library. There, he encountered a timid, gaunt scribe named Victor Holloway – a name that resonated ominously with Leopold’s fragmented memories of his brother. Under Victor’s guidance, Leopold spent four laborious hours transcribing a *Charm Person* spell into his own burgeoning spellbook.

Sleep, when it came, was not entirely restful. Zariel, tending his plants, discovered a viscous, yellow lubricant on his knuckle. Collecting a sample, his dreams plunged him onto a cold table under a bright light, a rhythmic beeping in his ears. A voice muttered, "This one's awake, put him out," followed by a distant, chilling phrase: "Inform [blank] Council member. Project is underway." Kaladin's slumber was equally troubled. A serene field of tall grass under Feywild-like light turned nightmarish as his footfalls cracked upon a carpet of skulls and bones. He found himself in a dark pit, its walls like shifting black cloth, a desperate voice echoing, "Let me out."

The morning brought a new layer of unease. Zariel, trying to compare his mysterious lubricant sample with Leopold's, awkwardly woke the warforged while attempting to "borrow" some from his joints. "Howdy," Zariel began, "I didn't want to disturb you, Leo... I had a weird liquid on me... I just wanted to see if it was from you." Leopold, after a comically thorough analysis involving a makeshift distiller, confirmed the substance was indeed gear lubricant, chemically similar to his own, though its precise origin on Zariel remained a puzzle.

With a new lead, a cryptic token, and minds filled with unsettling visions and unanswered questions, the O’dears prepared to face the coming day, the shadow of the Hand of God looming larger, and their own personal mysteries deepening with every step. The Don District, and the secrets hidden within its chapel basement, awaited.

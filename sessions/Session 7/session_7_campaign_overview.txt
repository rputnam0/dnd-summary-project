Identified the PCs' 'Isoptic Curse' potential, recruited them. Directed the party to Hamhock. Casual but authoritative. Observed by Zariel discussing another dome, missing persons, etc. Personally assigned Case 22391. Summoned the party back to HQ via Ratshit after their tunnel investigation. Conducted Zariel's post-mission briefing: Used silence and indirect questioning. Discerned via Zariel's high Insight that Levi knew about the hidden woman but chose not to press when Zariel omitted her, seemingly satisfied and deciding a course based on this. Observed using a high-tech runic bracelet. *(Not encountered Session 5-7)*.
*   **Lord Marshall Thurr:** High-ranking Stonewall Legionnaire leader. 'Bear of a man', beard, scar, cob pipe. Observed tryouts. Confirmed Legionnaire interest in Isoptic Curse. Endorsed Levi's offer. Fought alongside party against Cursed Fire Elemental. Initiated the cursed soldier program. Conducted Kaladin's post-mission briefing regarding the fey woman and Lancex. Briefed the party and Omen Knights on the Moonhaven expedition and the associated festival, outlining the party's "Watchdog" role. Granted Kaladin's request (Persuasion Nat 20) for party involvement in the fey woman's care. Oversaw the festival and ordered the Arcane Splitter's activation. During the subsequent werewolf and cultist attack, he was persuaded by Leopold to remain and manage the Splitter, sending his "Blackguard" Knight through instead. Abruptly departed the battle after receiving a comm from a calm female voice requesting his presence elsewhere. *(Status: Missing/Unknown Location)*
*   **Hamhawk:** Ogre-like female humanoid smithy for the Legionnaires. Gruff, efficient, protective of her advanced forge (Storm District). Underbite, sharp canines, glasses, blonde pigtail.

Revealed Splitter's purpose (Moonhaven). Received final component, confirmed completion. Continued rebuffing Leopold's apprenticeship attempts. Informed party Ratshit was looking for them. *(Not encountered Session 6-7)*.
*   **Donnie Farsight (aka Ratshit):** Malnourished-looking half-orc handler for the party. Cynical, fast-talking. Explained barracks procedures, gear, pay/lottery. Delivered gear and first mission folder. Relayed Levi's summons. Facilitated return to HQ and briefings. Deceived by Leopold's prank. Explained reward options. Conveyed Thurr's instruction about Lancex's club. Provided "Watchdog" assignment, requested party name. After festival attack, debriefed party, praised Zariel. Lied to Leopold about civilian casualty (Zariel detected lie). Assigned mission: find "The Hand of God" cult leader (alive), suggesting starting in Dawn District/Spit and Swallow. Stated "nobody called [Thurr] off," contradicting party's intel. *(Not encountered Session 6-7)*.
*   **Selena Sal:** Eccentric, seemingly ancient potion shop owner (Storm District). Huge goggles, messy bun, patchwork muumuu. Potentially senile or feigning it. Has a talking hermit crab, Marcel. Her shop contains the hidden entrance to the Fungal Tunnels. Her involvement/awareness remains unknown. *(Not encountered Session 2-7)*.
*   **Lancex the Fungal Guardian:** Former Stonewall Legionnaire assimilated and mutated into a powerful Myconid Sovereign variant. His club's magic was transferred to Kaladin's weapon. *(Status: Deceased/Destroyed)*
*   **Mysterious Woman on Altar:** Young, fair-skinned woman with dirty brown hair. Wears a well-crafted glass mask filled with living plants. Mask emits powerful, chaotic Fey magic vital for her survival. Turned over to Legionnaire command, housed in secure medical sub-level under Thurr's supervision. Party has access runes. Condition remains unconscious. Kaladin feels connection to mask. Zariel found facility familiar, felt faint connection to her. Thurr noted unique magic. Kaladin's dreams suggest a connection to an entity trying to get "out." *(Status: Unconscious, under Legionnaire care in a secure medical facility, party has access)*
*   **Blackguard Knight (Formerly "Omen Knight (Unnamed)"):** Extremely imposing figure in sleek, all-black armor with jagged pauldrons and an enormous greatsword. Reported party's discovery of fey woman to Thurr. Confirmed by Thurr as elite "Blackguard." Deployed by Thurr through the reopened dome during festival attack to fight werewolf. Leopold felt "click" of recognition but couldn't place it (potential link to brother Victor or scribe Victor Holloway). *(Status: Active, currently outside the Arcane Dome fighting the werewolf)*
*   **Unnamed Posh Nobleman:** Arrogant participant in Legionnaire tryouts; Kaladin's opponent. Revealed he was cursed, transformed into a Fire Elemental. *(Status: Deceased/Destroyed as Fire Elemental)*
*   **Philindra Sprawlweaver:** Owner of the "Mystical Scripts Scroll" shop in the Market District. Professional, friendly woman. *(Not encountered Session 5-7)*.
*   **Cedric ("The Champ"):** *(Updated)* Large, muscular man (pugilist build), champion of the Spit and Swallow fighting pit. Initially wore simple hand wraps; post-transformation, fists and forearms appear wrapped in inlaid gold, part of his skin/tattoos. Wears a waist chain/rosary with an iron symbol of a right hand (palm outward, curled fingers - Hand of God symbol). Initially stoic, becomes respectful/apologetic after defeat, missing teeth.
    *   **Abilities & Curse:** Challenged the party after their pit victories. Possesses significant power linked to the Isoptric Curse. Can unleash energy to heal/empower others (leveled party to 4). In combat, uses multi-attack (fists, kick), Calculated Loss (bonus action move/debuff), legendary actions for extra attacks, inflicts delayed radiant damage, and applies conditions (Stun via Tunnel Vision, Action Denial via Out of Breath) on hits via CON saves. Under pressure, underwent a transformation: radiant energy pulsed, veins glowed, eyes shone, forearms gained golden inlay, power increased but control seemed diminished (similar to Fire Elemental transformation). Claimed to channel power from the goddess Viteo, but the transformation felt unprecedented/uncontrolled to him.
    *   **Hand of God Connection:** Confirmed affiliation with the "Hand of God" cult, acting as a "scouter" finding talent for them. Provided the party with the cult's base location (a chapel basement in the Dawn District) and gave them his Hand symbol token as a potential means of access/introduction. Became defensive when pressed by Leopold about direct involvement.
    *   *(Status: Defeated by party, provided information & token, remains at Spit and Swallow)*

## Ongoing Mysteries & Goals

*   What is the full nature, origin, and range of effects of the Isoptic Curse? (Note: Stress Point activation observed - Zariel used 3 total; Leopold 1 used; Kaladin 1 used. **Cedric demonstrated significant power increase, transformation (radiant energy, physical changes), enhanced abilities, but also apparent loss of control, linking it to Viteo worship.** Cost/drawbacks still largely unknown, though Cedric's "Next Round" ability imposes halved max HP.) *(New Info)*
*   What are the details surrounding Zariel's memory loss and 'accident'? What is the significance of his dream of stasis/medical care? (Note: Metallic sheen. Legionnaire medical facility felt "somewhat familiar". Repeated near-death experiences. **New dream fragment reinforces medical/experimental origin: table, light, monitor, "This one's awake, put him out," "inform [blank] Council member. Project is underway."**) *(New Info)*
*   What happened during Leopold's past (deactivation, memory issues)? What is the story behind his "Bone Grinder" emblem? Was his brother truly an Omen Knight named Victor? What did his dream signify? (Note: Memory flash confirmed past potion-making link. Memory flash linked pit fighting to "blood pits," "Father," and brother "Victor" getting promoted to "captain." Felt recognition with Blackguard Knight. Library research yielded little. **Encountered library scribe named Victor Holloway.**) *(New Info)*
*   What were Kaladin's specific dreams motivating him? What is the nature of his connection to the Feywild/past lives hinted at in dreams/vision? (Note: Potent Fey magic discovered. Researched Feywild history. Experienced vision connecting him to woman. Still feels strong connection to fey woman's mask. Had disturbing dream of spider-creature. **New dream featured field turning to bones/skulls, dark pit with cloth walls, and a voice demanding "Let me out."**) *(New Info)*
*   What are the potential consequences or drawbacks of using Stress Points? (Note: Power demonstrated, 3 used by Zariel, 1 by Leopold. Cost remains unknown. Zariel collapsed after using two in Session 6.)
*   Who was the figure Kaladin saw watching him before the tryouts?
*   What is the significance of Zariel's red-tipped orchid?
*   How common is the Isoptic Curse? How is it perceived? (Note: Thurr actively recruiting/testing. First case recorded. Cedric is another example, potentially recruited by cult.)
*   What is the full power structure of the Stonewall Legionnaires and New New Arbor? What is the significance of the Omen Knights and Alabaster Lords? (Note: Omen Knights confirmed elite. Thurr commands "Blackguard" unit. Mysterious female voice could command Thurr. **Zariel's dream mentioned a "[blank] Council member" connected to a "Project".**) *(New Info)*
*   What is the significance of Captain Levi's meeting regarding another domed city? (Note: Related to Moonhaven mission, which was attacked.)

*   What is the significance of the small film reel Leopold received?
*   What will happen on Leopold's arranged "date" with Marcel the Hermit Crab?
*   Who/what is the mysterious woman found on the altar? What is the purpose/nature of her plant-filled mask and connection to Fey magic? (Note: Mask vital. Transferred to Legionnaire care; party has access. Thurr studying her. Kaladin feels connection. Zariel felt familiarity/connection. Kaladin's vision suggests she's from outside dome. **Kaladin's latest dream ("Let me out") strengthens connection to a trapped entity potentially linked to her.**) *(New Info)*
*   Who is the "he" that Lancex warned is "coming for her"? (Note: Phrase echoed in Kaladin's first nightmare. **Kaladin's latest dream voice ("Let me out") is likely the same entity.**) *(New Info)*

*   What is the creature from Kaladin's dream? (Note: Original dream involved spider-like creature. New dream involved a pit and voice.)

(Note: Operates from Spit and Swallow (recruitment) and a chapel basement in the Dawn District.

*   What is the nature of Leopold's "click" of recognition with the Blackguard Knight? Is there a connection to his past, potentially his brother Victor? (Note: Memory flash potentially links Victor to promotion and "blood pits." **Encountered scribe Victor Holloway in Core Library.**) *(New Info)*
*   What will the Omen Knights (and the deployed Blackguard) find at Moonhaven, and what will be their ultimate fate against the werewolf and other potential external threats?

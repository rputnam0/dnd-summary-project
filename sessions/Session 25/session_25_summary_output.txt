The taste of victory in Cottonwood was sweet, but fleeting. In the quiet hours before their journey resumed, the O’dears found moments for themselves. Cletus, the gentle giant, sat cross-legged, coaxing the spirit of the woods from his new staff, a gift from the shaman Cornelius. The gnarled wood hummed, and in a gesture of camaraderie, Cletus plucked a magically roasted almond from its core and offered it to Leopold, forging a mystical bond between them.

Leopold, ever the tinkerer, was already at work on a promise made to Cletus’s squirrel, Chip. Blueprints for an almond-exploding rifle took shape, but an early propellant test proved… volatile. With a cry of, “I suggest you all stand back!” he lit a fuse. The resulting blast was more than he’d bargained for, cartoonishly fraying the prototype and singeing Chip’s eyebrows clean off, leaving the squirrel with an unreadable, hairless expression of shock. Zariel, meanwhile, found his own efforts rebuffed. The werewolf pups he’d adopted, once loyal, had grown wary during his absence, their trust a fragile thing that would need to be re-earned.

After a final, grateful farewell with Cornelius, who warned them of the “unsightly threats” in the woods ahead, the party set off. Their destination: the shattered North Dome of Moonhaven, a week’s journey through the formidable Chiari Rung Forest. The forest did not wait to show its teeth. Before they had even cleared the village border, Zariel’s pathfinding faltered. The woods answered with a cacophony of snarls as a warband of Gnolls burst from the treeline, one leaping onto a nearby thatch roof with a crunch.

The fight was as sudden as it was brief. While Kaladen and Cyrus moved to engage, Zariel unleashed the wild heart of the forest itself. Eight spectral wolves tore through the veil of reality, a tide of phantom fur and teeth. The Gnolls, caught in the open, were massacred in a storm of snapping jaws, their ambush turned into a slaughter. The silence that followed was heavy, broken only by the whimpering retreat of the last survivor. From a nearby cottage, a voice drifted out, “We didn’t have insurance…”

Shaken but resolute, the party pressed on. Yet the forest seemed cursed. A second and then a third attempt to navigate its twisting paths failed disastrously. The ground began to tremble, the water in puddles vibrating with rhythmic, earth-shaking footsteps. A cacophonous roar echoed through the dense trees as a monster from a forgotten age burst into view—a Tyrannosaurus Rex, its massive head swinging low, flanked by two chittering Velociraptors.

The beast struck with the force of a landslide, its tail whipping out and catching Cletus, sending him sprawling. Before he could recover, the reptile’s immense jaw snapped down, lifting him from the ground. He dangled helplessly, caught between teeth the size of daggers, his arm hanging by a thread of sinew as the creature’s bite crushed the life from him. He fell unconscious, a broken toy in the monster’s maw.

As desperation set in, Zariel met the primeval challenge with one of his own. With a roar that answered the T-Rex’s, his form twisted and swelled, bones cracking and reshaping until he, too, stood as a Tyrant Lizard, a mirror image of raw, wild power. The two titans clashed while the party rallied. Kaladen unleashed blasts of pure force, Leopold’s searing saber cut deep, and Cyrus scrambled into the fray, his own swords a blur. As the beast, wounded and bleeding, tried to turn and flee, the party fell upon it. A thorn whip from Zariel entangled its leg, and in a brutal, coordinated beatdown, they brought the monster crashing to the earth.

The day had been a litany of violence. Cletus, healed but deeply shaken, planted his staff into the ground. From it grew a magnificent willow tree, its branches weeping to the forest floor, forming a perfect, impenetrable sanctuary. Beneath its shimmering, firefly-lit canopy, the O’dears finally found their rest. But for two of them, the night held no peace.

Kaladen, his attempt to enchant a ring of protection ending in a painful backlash of arcane energy, fell into a troubled meditation. The chaos of his waking hours bled into his mind, but then, a familiar peace settled. He found himself in a golden field, standing before Faye Lara. She faced away from him, looking out over a cliff’s edge at a breathtaking, horrifying vista: the dome of Moonhaven, a great crack splitting its sky-shield as the surrounding ocean was unnaturally sucked into its broken form. The scent of wildflowers filled the air. “You’re so close, can’t you feel it?” her voice drifted to him, a whisper on the wind. She pointed toward the drowning city. “There. There you’ll find who you are.” And with a gust of wind, her form exploded into a thousand petals, carried away into the dream.

In another corner of the willow’s sanctuary, Leopold’s rest was not a dream, but a memory, sharp and cruel. He was a boy again, a scrawny, malnourished elf with fiery red hair, his skin a canvas of pain where a harsh mentor had carved bleeding arcane runes. “How can you improve on yourself if you constantly quit?” the mentor’s voice echoed, dripping with disappointment. In the flickering torchlight stood his brother, Victor—a prodigy of violence, all lean muscle and embers for eyes. The mentor’s words laid their purpose bare: “One perfecting the arcane and one perfecting will and power. One goal. Do not fail.” The threat that followed was a chilling prophecy: “Victor, if you maim or kill any more children, I swear to the gods, I’ll replace your brain with a powered core.” Leopold awoke with a gasp, the phantom pain of the runes still fresh. Inspecting his Steel Defender, he found a new mystery: its power core, and that of his own Searing Saber, were now linked, pulsing with a shared, growing energy he did not create.

As morning broke, one final discovery awaited. Inside Zariel’s pocket workshop, the golden egg they’d taken from the Fire Spirit’s nest had cracked open. Within lay not a creature, but a magnificent cloak of orange and black feathers that seemed to smolder with an inner fire. The Embered Mane. As Zariel touched it, its history flooded his mind. The Fire Spirit had been no mere beast; it was once a humanoid from the West Dome, transformed by the Isoptric Curse 400 years ago and recruited as one of six great generals to a forgotten “Cursed King.”

The party had survived the day, yet made no ground. The forest still loomed, but the journey to Moonhaven was no longer just a mission. For Kaladen, it was a search for his soul. For Leopold, a confrontation with a past he was forced to create. And for all of them, the path north was now intertwined with the ancient, cursed history of Avarias itself.

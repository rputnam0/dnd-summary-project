The fresh sting of betrayal and the cold reality of the Fey Woman’s petrification fueled the newly-minted Omen Knights. Promotion and potent, if peculiar, lottery winnings – Kaladin’s Potion of Soulwood Prosthesis, Leopold’s death-defying Porcelain Doll, and Zariel’s wondrous Pocket Workshop – did little to dull their urgency. Cedric, the Hand of God’s monstrous champion, had fled with the vital mask, and the O’dears, now including Kaladin wielding the Light Splitter, a transformed relic of their last foe, were on his heels.

Their pursuit plunged them back into the shadowed depths beneath the Court of Viteo, Zariel’s keen senses guiding them through the labyrinthine tunnels where the scent of wildflowers, a tell-tale sign of the mask, still faintly lingered. The hand-carved passages eventually gave way to a vast, natural cavern, dripping with mineral deposits and the echoes of distant water. There, amidst the stalagmites, Kaladin, moving like a whisper, scouted ahead. His blood ran cold at the sight: Cedric, now a seven-foot behemoth, his flesh warped and interwoven with grotesque green vines, his eyes smoldering with dark smoke, wore the Fey Woman’s mask. He muttered to his lone cultist companion, "I don't understand. It has to be around here somewhere... He speaks in riddles, but he's promising power once we get out." The "he" they sought, and the "water you can jump in," remained a chilling enigma as the monstrous pugilist and his follower made camp.

The party’s plan for a stealthy takedown crumbled with an ill-timed clang. As they crept forward under Zariel's Pass Without Trace, a dislodged stalactite struck Leopold’s armor, and Zariel, in a moment of unfortunate loudness, let out a yelp. The cultist’s head snapped towards them. "Boss!" he cried, and the cavern erupted into chaos.

Kaladin reacted instantly, a crackling tendril of lightning lashing out to drag the cultist into their midst. Zariel, with a guttural roar, unleashed his Flame Blade – not as a wielded scimitar, but as fiery extensions of his own claws – before transforming into a towering, bipedal bear, a comical bowler hat now inexplicably perched atop his ursine head. Leopold, ever the pragmatist, unleashed a torrent of Burning Hands, searing the cultist, while his prepared Magic Stones found their mark. The cultist, outmatched and overwhelmed by Kaladin’s new Light Splitter and Zariel’s flaming bear-mauling, fell in a cloud of ash.

Cedric, enraged, his form twisting further, joined the fray. He was a whirlwind of destructive power, his fists and kicks landing with devastating force. Kaladin, undeterred, wove arcane energies, unleashing a sculpted Burning Hands that seared Cedric, followed by a critical Firebolt that exploded against the monstrosity. Leopold maintained a relentless barrage, his Witch Bolt crackling around Cedric, each pulse a jolt of agony, supplemented by precisely aimed Magic Stones and a searing Bonfire that forced Cedric to dance. Zariel, in his peculiar bipedal bear form, became a maelstrom of fiery claws and snapping jaws, relentlessly tearing at the brute. "I want to just bite him right on the butt cheek, just flaming teeth and all!" he’d declared, and the image stuck.

As Cedric teetered on the brink, his body wracked with damage, a terrifying stillness fell upon him. His limbs went limp, then impossibly stiff, his head cocking as shadows poured from his eyes. Time itself seemed to shatter. Kaladin alone remained unfrozen as a voice, ancient and chilling, whispered in his mind and on the air: "Finally a chance to chat." The entity, speaking through Cedric’s broken form, confessed, "I was in darkness for a long time, sealed for a crime that I don't believe to be mine to have committed. You are definitely relation to me, but not direct kin, but my blood flows through your veins." It tasked Kaladin with a dangerous mission: "Analyze the organization you work for. Test where their convictions lie. That is all. Find me when you're ready for the truth." When Kaladin, stunned, asked how, the voice faded with a cryptic, "Well, if you're strong enough to find me next, you'll have means to talk to me."

The spell broke. Motion returned. Cedric, a mere puppet now, was on his last legs. Kaladin’s Light Splitter swung, a desperate miss fueled by the disorienting revelation. But Zariel, no longer a bear but still channeling the Flame Blade’s fury into his hand, saw his opening. With a visceral cry, he lunged, his fiery hand tracing a brutal arc. "Like when you're taking a scoop of ice cream," he’d later recount, "I'm just scooping his whole ass out, cutting him in half." Cedric, bisected, collapsed.

Kaladin snatched the mask from the fallen giant. A wave of warmth, desirable and potent, surged through him, the scent of wildflowers overwhelmingly pungent. As the mask left Cedric’s face, his monstrous form instantly turned to stone, cracking and crumbling into dust.

The "water you can jump in" remained. Following Cedric’s last known direction, Zariel, now a giant spider, scouted a deep, dark shaft where a subterranean river roared. "It's survivable," he chittered upon returning, casually adding, "There was one other spider down there. Not sure what it wanted, but it didn't last long."

With Zariel's Pocket Workshop, Leopold, with surprising speed, constructed a sturdy boat. "Well, Zariel, Kaladin, what do you think?" he asked, dusting off his hands, a Viking crest adorning the bow. Their entry into the shaft was a chaotic bobsled run, the boat plunging into the churning water. The rapids were a maelstrom, tossing them violently. Zariel, struggling against the current, was nearly lost, his grip failing despite Leopold’s aid, until Kaladin, with a precisely sculpted Lightning Lure, snagged him back from the brink.

For what felt like hours, they plummeted through the dark, water crashing over the bow, Leopold's magically lit crest the only beacon. Then, gradually, the torrent calmed to a gentle flow. As dawn approached, a soft light appeared ahead. They emerged, blinking, not into another cavern, but onto a sun-dappled riverbank, beneath an impossibly blue sky. Lush greenery surrounded them; birdsong filled the air. There was no dome.

"Where do you suppose we are?" Leopold wondered, his head swiveling with an unnatural mechanical smoothness before he pointed. "Oh, the dome is just over that way." Miles distant, the familiar curve of the Southern Dome shimmered. Zariel, ever observant, voiced a growing suspicion. "Who stands to benefit from people thinking the outside is dangerous? I have a feeling that that opening of the dome was staged." Their Legionnaire technology – comms, armor abilities, maps – was dead. They were truly on their own.

Deciding to skirt the dome towards the Market District and the Arcane Splitter’s breach, their journey took them into a boggy marsh. Leopold’s keen senses, honed by his mechanical nature, picked up splashing. With a Natural 20 on his Nature check, he discerned the source: a colossal frog, knee-high to a man, was enthusiastically hunting giant beetles, its bellows echoing across the wetlands. The O’dears had found their way out, but Avarias, it seemed, had many more surprises in store.

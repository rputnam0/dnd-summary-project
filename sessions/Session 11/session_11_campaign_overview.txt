Healed by Kaladin. Knocked unconscious again by The Reverend. While unconscious, was hit by a Divine Beam Lair Action, which burned away flesh revealing his metallic components (forearms, elbow joint) to Kaladin and Leopold. Made a successful Death Save. Healed by Leopold. Post-battle, used Faerie Fire to investigate faint footprints near The Reverend's remains, which then vanished. During a long rest, experienced another vision (copper city, voice asking "How do you know you're just a robot? Is she worth the cost?"). Confided in Kaladin and Leopold about his revealed metallic nature, his dreams, and his fear/need for research, receiving their support. Promoted to Omen Knight rank along with the party, receiving an armor upgrade voucher. Received a Tiny Red Toolbox (later identified as Pocket Workshop) from the Legionnaire lottery.
        *   **Tracking Cedric & Escaping the Dome (Session 11):** Leveled up to 5. Identified his Pocket Workshop lottery item. Led the party in tracking the transformed Cedric with exceptional Survival skills through tunnels into a natural cave system. Contributed to a botched group stealth attempt (Nat 1). In combat, cast Flame Blade (manifesting as fiery claws) and Wild Shaped into a (bipedal, bowler-hat-wearing) Bear, dealing significant fire damage but taking heavy damage and reverting. Continued fighting with Flame Blade and used a Legionnaire healing syringe. Landed the killing blow on Cedric with a visceral "ice cream scoop" attack. Offered his Pocket Workshop for Leopold to construct a boat. Wild Shaped into a Giant Spider to scout a deep water shaft, confirming it was survivable. Struggled to get into the boat in the rapids (multiple failed Strength saves) and was saved by Kaladin. Emerged with the party outside the Southern Dome, where his Legionnaire tech failed. Used Survival to estimate their location. Theorized that the "danger outside the dome" was staged by the authorities to keep people in.

## Key NPCs

*   **Captain Levi:** Stonewall Legionnaire officer. Wears distinctive 'bucket' hat and vest, wields advanced hand crossbows. Oversees Legionnaire tryouts. Identified the PCs' 'Isoptic Curse' potential, recruited them. Directed the party to Hamhock. Casual but authoritative. Observed by Zariel discussing another dome, missing persons, etc. Personally assigned Case 22391. Summoned the party back to HQ via Ratshit after their tunnel investigation. Conducted Zariel's post-mission briefing: Used silence and indirect questioning. Discerned via Zariel's high Insight that Levi knew about the hidden woman but chose not to press when Zariel omitted her, seemingly satisfied and deciding a course based on this. Observed using a high-tech runic bracelet.
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Participated in the Hand of God cult briefing, questioning the party's actions regarding Xander. Led a strike team to provide reconnaissance and overwatch for the party's infiltration. Provided comms updates during the operation, reporting thousands of cultists emerging city-wide ("This is huge") and then that the Legionnaire Core itself was under attack. Dispatched his mage from chapel surveillance and stated he was heading back to the Core.
    *   **(Session 10 Update):** Communicated with Kaladin during the battle against The Reverend, confirming he was en route to the Med Bay. Later reported to the party via comms that the Fey Woman had been turned to stone after Cedric stole her mask during an attack on the Med Bay, and that Cedric had escaped through tunnels, possibly heading towards their location. He debriefed the party post-battle at HQ, gathered information about The Reverend's defeat, confirmed Sylvaris Sunseeker's retirement, and promoted Kaladin, Leopold, and Zariel to Omen Knight rank, providing armor upgrade vouchers. Tasked Ratchet with getting a sample of the liquid from the mausoleum. *(Status: Active at Legionnaire HQ, managing fallout from cult uprising and Med Bay attack, promoted the party).*
*   **Lord Marshall Thurr:** High-ranking Stonewall Legionnaire leader. 'Bear of a man', beard, scar, cob pipe. Observed tryouts. Confirmed Legionnaire interest in Isoptic Curse. Endorsed Levi's offer. Fought alongside party against Cursed Fire Elemental. Initiated the cursed soldier program. Conducted Kaladin's post-mission briefing regarding the fey woman and Lancex. Briefed the party and Omen Knights on the Moonhaven expedition and the associated festival, outlining the party's "Watchdog" role. Granted Kaladin's request (Persuasion Nat 20) for party involvement in the fey woman's care. Oversaw the festival and ordered the Arcane Splitter's activation. During the subsequent werewolf and cultist attack, he was persuaded by Leopold to remain and manage the Splitter, sending his "Blackguard" Knight through instead. Abruptly departed the battle after receiving a comm from a calm female voice requesting his presence elsewhere.
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Returned to Legionnaire HQ. Attended the urgent Hand of God cult briefing, allocating significant resources: Ratchet to lead the party's group, Levi to lead a strike team, and an Omen Knight task force. Privately informed Kaladin that he (Thurr) is under scrutiny by the council and suspects a leak within the government, tying up his personal involvement in the field. Captain Levi mentioned in Session 10 "Lord Marshall will be in touch when he can." *(Status: Active, at Legionnaire HQ, dealing with internal political issues and suspected leak, expected to contact party eventually)*
*   **Hamhawk:** Ogre-like female humanoid smithy for the Legionnaires. Gruff, efficient, protective of her advanced forge (Storm District). Underbite, sharp canines, glasses, blonde pigtail. Crafted party's custom gear. Provided Leopold schematics for "Project Splitter" (now "Arcane Splitter"). Tasked Leopold with gathering materials. Upgraded Kaladin's weapon. Revealed Splitter's purpose (Moonhaven). Received final component, confirmed completion. Continued rebuffing Leopold's apprenticeship attempts. Informed party Ratshit was looking for them. Upgraded Kaladin's and Zariel's armor to medium for cost of materials. Zariel perceived a blueprint on her lab table. Leopold's attempt to persuade her to contact him for jobs was met with noncommittal silence.
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Quickly upgraded the party's comms system with a quiet/loud toggle. Was observed by the party working on a schematic for a new "plasma sword" design. Impressed by Leopold's suggestion for an internal power source for the sword, she offered him a conditional apprenticeship if he could find a suitable energy source. *(Status: Active at her forge)*.
*   **Donnie Farsight (Ratshit):** Malnourished-looking half-orc handler for the party. Cynical, fast-talking. Explained barracks procedures, gear, pay/lottery. Delivered gear and first mission folder. Relayed Levi's summons. Facilitated return to HQ and briefings. Deceived by Leopold's prank. Explained reward options. Conveyed Thurr's instruction about Lancex's club. Provided "Watchdog" assignment, requested party name. After festival attack, debriefed party, praised Zariel. Lied to Leopold about civilian casualty (Zariel detected lie). Assigned mission: find "The Hand of God" cult leader (alive), suggesting starting in Dawn District/Spit and Swallow. Stated "nobody called [Thurr] off," contradicting party's intel. Received party's report on Cedric/chapel lead. Seen using arcane rune wrist guard projecting to a pad for input. Stated Dawn District is not his primary responsibility (Storm District is). Denied Kaladin's request for an armor voucher. Rudely dismissed Leopold's offer to help with paperwork ("You are my fucking subordinate. Get the fuck out of here.").
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Documented ("Meeting 435") the Hand of God cult briefing. Assigned by Thurr to lead and accompany the party's infiltration group. Provided them with extra gear (enchanted cuffs, arcane stun grenades, extra healing). Joined the party in the mausoleum infiltration. In the "mass suicide" chamber, detected "off" radiant energy coating residue in cups, expressing unease. Provided combat support with Bless, Guidance (to Leopold), Shatter, and Toll the Dead. Argued with Leopold mid-combat about the metaphysics of healing Zariel's bear form. Took 20 damage from an Undead Soldier.
    *   **(Session 10 Update):** Fought alongside the party against The Reverend, providing crucial healing (Healing Word on Zariel) and re-establishing Bless. Took significant damage, was knocked unconscious by The Reverend, healed by Zariel, then knocked unconscious again by an Undead Soldier. Failed one death save, then made a successful one (Nat 19). Was stabilized by Leopold's Medicine check and evacuated from The Reverend's chapel by Sylvaris Sunseeker. Recovered enough by the next morning to be present at the debriefing with Captain Levi (arm in a sling), taking notes. Informed the party there was no cash reward for the mission, citing their promotion and tavern winnings as compensation. Facilitated their use of the Legionnaire lottery machine. *(Status: Active, recovering from injuries at Legionnaire HQ, continues role as party handler).*
*   **Selena Sal:** Eccentric, seemingly ancient potion shop owner (Storm District). Huge goggles, messy bun, patchwork muumuu. Potentially senile or feigning it. Has a talking hermit crab, Marcel. Her shop contains the hidden entrance to the Fungal Tunnels. Her involvement/awareness remains unknown. *(Not encountered Session 2-11)*.
*   **Lancex the Fungal Guardian:** Former Stonewall Legionnaire assimilated and mutated into a powerful Myconid Sovereign variant. His club's magic was transferred to Kaladin's weapon. *(Status: Deceased/Destroyed)*
*   **Mysterious Woman on Altar:** Young, fair-skinned woman with dirty brown hair. Wears a well-crafted glass mask filled with living plants (mask recovered by Kaladin in Session 11). Mask emits powerful, chaotic Fey magic vital for her survival. Turned over to Legionnaire command, housed in secure medical sub-level under Thurr's supervision. Party has access runes. Condition was unconscious. Kaladin feels connection to mask. Zariel found facility familiar, felt faint connection to her. Thurr noted unique magic. Kaladin's dreams suggest a connection to an entity trying to get "out."
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Still unconscious in the Legionnaire Med Bay. Her location became under direct threat, as Beatrice (Med Bay staff) reported to Kaladin that intruders were trying to breach the Med Bay doors during the city-wide cultist uprising.
    *   **(Session 10 Update):** Her mask was stolen by Cedric during an attack he led on the Legionnaire Med Bay. Upon the removal of her mask, she instantly turned to stone (petrified), as reported by Captain Levi.
    *   **(Session 11 Update):** Her mask was recovered by Kaladin from Cedric's remains. Kaladin felt a power surge upon retrieving it. *(Status: Petrified, mask recovered by party. Currently a high-priority rescue/restoration case. Location remains Legionnaire Med Bay.)*
*   **Blackguard Knight (Formerly "Omen Knight (Unnamed)"):** Extremely imposing figure in sleek, all-black armor with jagged pauldrons and an enormous greatsword. Reported party's discovery of fey woman to Thurr. Confirmed by Thurr as elite "Blackguard." Deployed by Thurr through the reopened dome during festival attack to fight werewolf. Leopold felt "click" of recognition but couldn't place it (potential link to brother Victor or scribe Victor Holloway). *(Status: Active, last seen outside the Arcane Dome fighting the werewolf)*
*   **Unnamed Posh Nobleman:** Arrogant participant in Legionnaire tryouts; Kaladin's opponent. Revealed he was cursed, transformed into a Fire Elemental. *(Status: Deceased/Destroyed as Fire Elemental)*
*   **Philindra Sprawlweaver:** Owner of the "Mystical Scripts Scroll" shop in the Market District. Professional, friendly woman. *(Not encountered Session 5-11)*.
*   **Cedric ("The Champ"):** Large, muscular man (pugilist build), champion of the Spit and Swallow fighting pit. Initially wore simple hand wraps; post-transformation (Session 6), fists and forearms appeared wrapped in inlaid gold. Wore a waist chain/rosary with an iron symbol of a right hand (Hand of God symbol).
    *   **Abilities & Curse:** Possessed significant power linked to the Isoptric Curse. Could unleash energy to heal/empower others. In combat, used multi-attack, Calculated Loss, legendary actions, inflicted radiant damage, and applied conditions. Underwent a transformation increasing power but diminishing control. Claimed to channel Viteo.
    *   **Hand of God Connection:** Confirmed "scouter" for the Hand of God cult. Provided party with cult's base location and his Hand symbol token. Attended Father Kallor's sermon.
    *   **(Session 10 Update):** Led an attack on the Legionnaire Med Bay. His forces killed guards, and he personally stole the Fey Woman's mask, causing her petrification. Escaped through tunnels.
    *   **Transformed "Emperor of Monstrosity" (Session 11):** Tracked by the party to a subterranean cavern. His form had further mutated, appearing ~7ft tall, with flesh replaced by green, vine-like, ropey muscle fibers, and eyes emitting dark smoke. Wore the Fey Woman's mask. He was confused but following instructions from an unseen entity ("he") who promised power if he reached "water you can jump in." During combat, his body warped further, revealing more green growth and radiating purple smoke.
    *   **(Session 11 Update):** Served as a conduit for a Mysterious Entity that cast Time Stop and spoke to Kaladin. Was ultimately defeated by the party (killing blow by Zariel). Upon removal of the Fey Woman's mask from his remains, his body instantly turned to stone, cracked, and began to crumble. *(Status: Deceased. Fey Woman's mask recovered by Kaladin.)*
*   **High Cleric Father Kallor / The Reverend:** Formerly presented as an old, frail-appearing public figure, High Cleric of the Court of Viteo.
    *   **(Session 9 Revelation):** Revealed himself to be **"The Reverend,"** the fanatical leader of the "Hand of God" cult. Confronted the party in his hidden chapel beneath the Court of Viteo. Monologued about serving "Teo, God of Wrath."
    *   **Transformation & Abilities:** Transformed into **The Reverend:** a powerful, floating angelic being with expansive wings, eyes of light, and wielding a large, broken-but-hovering greatsword. Possessed Lair and Legendary Actions.
    *   **(Session 10 Update):** Battled the party and Ratchet. Ultimately defeated by Leopold's Catapult. His body ("gold metallic dust of skin," "gold blood") lies in his chapel. His greatsword transformed into a stained-glass longsword (Light Splitter) upon his death, recovered by Kaladin. *(Status: Deceased. Weapon recovered and attuned by Kaladin. Cult uprising continues.)*
*   **Xander (Cultist Groundskeeper):** "Devilishly handsome" male with Tiefling-esque features. Publicly a groundskeeper at the Court of Viteo, secretly a Hand of God cultist and gatekeeper. Charmed by Leopold, gave him mausoleum key. Abducted by party, interrogated, revealed cult details (leader "The Reverend," hundreds of members, tunnels, Cedric as recruiter). Suffered mental breakdown. *(Status: Captured by party, interrogated, held in Legionnaire HQ, mentally unstable.)*
*   **Sylvaris Sunseeker (Omen Knight Leader):** Tall, elven-heritage man, leader of an Omen Knight task force.
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** His task force was ambushed by cultists; transmitted a distress call before comms cut.
    *   **(Session 10 Update):** Burst into The Reverend's chapel mid-battle, heavily injured. Reported his team (Laser, Blazer, Taser) were killed. Assisted party in defeating remaining Undead Soldiers. Evacuated Ratchet. Captain Levi later reported Sylvaris retired from the Omen Knights. *(Status: Alive, but heavily injured and traumatized. Retired from the Omen Knights.)*
*   **Mysterious Entity (Name Unknown):** A powerful, unnamed entity.
    *   **(Session 11 Revelation):** Manifested through the transformed Cedric's body (limp, then stiff, head cocked, eyes emitting shadow) during the party's fight with him. Its voice was a whisper, heard by Kaladin mentally and verbally. Used a surge in power to cast Time Stop and communicate directly with Kaladin. Claimed a blood relationship ("my blood flows through your veins," but not direct kin). Stated it was "sealed for a crime that I don't believe to be mine to have committed" and had "found my way out of the shadow." It had been watching Kaladin's progress. Tasked Kaladin with analyzing the Legionnaires ("Test where their convictions lie. That is all. Find me when you're ready for the truth."). When Kaladin asked how to find it, the entity replied, "Well, if you're strong enough to find me next, you'll have means to talk to me." It seemed to be the force guiding Cedric and promising him power.
    *   **Significance:** Likely the "he" Lancex warned about and connected to Kaladin's dreams/Fey origins. A potent entity capable of high-level magic (Time Stop) and influencing others. Its claims and directives pose a major new plot direction and personal quest for Kaladin, and hint at a deeper, hidden history in Avarias. *(Status: Active, at large, nature and full motives unknown, has made direct contact with Kaladin and is a significant power.)*

## Important Events So Far

*   **Induction into the Stonewall Legionnaires:** Kaladin, Leopold, and Zariel attended Legionnaire tryouts, revealed potent 'Isoptic Curse' abilities, attracted high-level interest, collectively defeated a cursed Fire Elemental, and accepted offers to join the Legionnaires.
*   **Festival Attack and Rise of "The Hand of God":** During a public festival, a monstrous werewolf attacked Legionnaires outside the dome while extremist cultists, "The Hand of God," launched a coordinated assault from within. The party defended citizens and neutralized several cultists, revealing a dangerous new internal threat.
*   **Revelation and Defeat of 'The Reverend' & City-Wide Cult Uprising (Session 9 & 10):** Infiltrating the Hand of God's base, the party confronted High Cleric Father Kallor, revealed as "The Reverend," the cult's fanatical leader. Kallor transformed into a powerful angelic being. The party, with aid from an injured Sylvaris Sunseeker, defeated The Reverend. Simultaneously, the cult launched a massive, coordinated city-wide uprising, wiping out an Omen Knight task force and attacking Legionnaire Core.
*   **Theft of the Fey Woman's Mask and Her Petrification (Session 10):** While the party battled The Reverend, Cedric (Hand of God scouter) led an attack on the Legionnaire Med Bay. He stole the Mysterious Fey Woman's life-sustaining mask, causing her to instantly turn to stone. Cedric escaped.
*   **Pursuit of Cedric, Mask Recovery, and Emergence from the Dome (Session 11):** The party tracked the transformed Cedric into a subterranean cave system. After a fierce battle, during which a mysterious, powerful entity spoke to Kaladin through Cedric (claiming a blood tie and tasking him with investigating the Legionnaires), they defeated Cedric and recovered the Fey Woman's mask. Following Cedric's cryptic clue about "water you can jump in," they navigated a subterranean river, emerging outside New New Arbor's Southern Dome into a surprisingly pleasant, natural environment where their Legionnaire technology ceased to function.

*   **Vertical Water Shaft & Subterranean River System:** A deep, dark vertical shaft accessible from the natural cave system.

## Ongoing Mysteries & Goals

*   What is the full nature, origin, and range of effects of the Isoptic Curse? (Note: Cedric's advanced vine-like transformation observed. Entity used Cedric as conduit. The Reverend's angelic form. Cost/drawbacks still largely unknown.)

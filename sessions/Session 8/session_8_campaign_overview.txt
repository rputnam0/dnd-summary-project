## Key NPCs

*   **Captain Levi:** Stonewall Legionnaire officer. Wears distinctive 'bucket' hat and vest, wields advanced hand crossbows. Oversees Legionnaire tryouts. Identified the PCs' 'Isoptic Curse' potential, recruited them. Directed the party to Hamhock. Casual but authoritative. Observed by Zariel discussing another dome, missing persons, etc. Personally assigned Case 22391. Summoned the party back to HQ via Ratshit after their tunnel investigation. Conducted Zariel's post-mission briefing: Used silence and indirect questioning. Discerned via Zariel's high Insight that Levi knew about the hidden woman but chose not to press when Zariel omitted her, seemingly satisfied and deciding a course based on this. Observed using a high-tech runic bracelet. *(Not encountered Session 5-8)*.
*   **Lord Marshall Thurr:** High-ranking Stonewall Legionnaire leader. 'Bear of a man', beard, scar, cob pipe. Observed tryouts. Confirmed Legionnaire interest in Isoptic Curse. Endorsed Levi's offer. Fought alongside party against Cursed Fire Elemental. Initiated the cursed soldier program. Conducted Kaladin's post-mission briefing regarding the fey woman and Lancex. Briefed the party and Omen Knights on the Moonhaven expedition and the associated festival, outlining the party's "Watchdog" role. Granted Kaladin's request (Persuasion Nat 20) for party involvement in the fey woman's care. Oversaw the festival and ordered the Arcane Splitter's activation. During the subsequent werewolf and cultist attack, he was persuaded by Leopold to remain and manage the Splitter, sending his "Blackguard" Knight through instead. Abruptly departed the battle after receiving a comm from a calm female voice requesting his presence elsewhere. *(Status: Missing/Unknown Location)*
*   **Hamhawk:** Ogre-like female humanoid smithy for the Legionnaires. Gruff, efficient, protective of her advanced forge (Storm District). Underbite, sharp canines, glasses, blonde pigtail. Crafted party's custom gear. Provided Leopold schematics for "Project Splitter" (now "Arcane Splitter"). Tasked Leopold with gathering materials. Upgraded Kaladin's weapon. Revealed Splitter's purpose (Moonhaven). Received final component, confirmed completion. Continued rebuffing Leopold's apprenticeship attempts. Informed party Ratshit was looking for them. Upgraded Kaladin's and Zariel's armor to medium for cost of materials. Informed Kaladin that potions/rings of protection are Market District finds or for deserving Legionnaires. Zariel perceived a blueprint on her lab table. Leopold's attempt to persuade her to contact him for jobs was met with noncommittal silence. *(Not encountered Session 6-7)*.
*   **Donnie Farsight (aka Ratshit):** Malnourished-looking half-orc handler for the party. Cynical, fast-talking. Explained barracks procedures, gear, pay/lottery. Delivered gear and first mission folder. Relayed Levi's summons. Facilitated return to HQ and briefings. Deceived by Leopold's prank. Explained reward options. Conveyed Thurr's instruction about Lancex's club. Provided "Watchdog" assignment, requested party name. After festival attack, debriefed party, praised Zariel. Lied to Leopold about civilian casualty (Zariel detected lie). Assigned mission: find "The Hand of God" cult leader (alive), suggesting starting in Dawn District/Spit and Swallow. Stated "nobody called [Thurr] off," contradicting party's intel. Received party's report on Cedric/chapel lead. Seen using arcane rune wrist guard projecting to a pad for input. Stated Dawn District is not his primary responsibility (Storm District is). Denied Kaladin's request for an armor voucher. Rudely dismissed Leopold's offer to help with paperwork ("You are my fucking subordinate. Get the fuck out of here."). *(Not encountered Session 6-7)*.
*   **Selena Sal:** Eccentric, seemingly ancient potion shop owner (Storm District). Huge goggles, messy bun, patchwork muumuu. Potentially senile or feigning it. Has a talking hermit crab, Marcel. Her shop contains the hidden entrance to the Fungal Tunnels. Her involvement/awareness remains unknown. *(Not encountered Session 2-8)*.
*   **Lancex the Fungal Guardian:** Former Stonewall Legionnaire assimilated and mutated into a powerful Myconid Sovereign variant. His club's magic was transferred to Kaladin's weapon. *(Status: Deceased/Destroyed)*
*   **Mysterious Woman on Altar:** Young, fair-skinned woman with dirty brown hair. Wears a well-crafted glass mask filled with living plants. Mask emits powerful, chaotic Fey magic vital for her survival. Turned over to Legionnaire command, housed in secure medical sub-level under Thurr's supervision. Party has access runes. Condition remains unconscious. Kaladin feels connection to mask. Zariel found facility familiar, felt faint connection to her. Thurr noted unique magic. Kaladin's dreams suggest a connection to an entity trying to get "out." *(Status: Unconscious, under Legionnaire care in a secure medical facility, party has access)*
*   **Blackguard Knight (Formerly "Omen Knight (Unnamed)"):** Extremely imposing figure in sleek, all-black armor with jagged pauldrons and an enormous greatsword. Reported party's discovery of fey woman to Thurr. Confirmed by Thurr as elite "Blackguard." Deployed by Thurr through the reopened dome during festival attack to fight werewolf. Leopold felt "click" of recognition but couldn't place it (potential link to brother Victor or scribe Victor Holloway). *(Status: Active, currently outside the Arcane Dome fighting the werewolf)*
*   **Unnamed Posh Nobleman:** Arrogant participant in Legionnaire tryouts; Kaladin's opponent. Revealed he was cursed, transformed into a Fire Elemental. *(Status: Deceased/Destroyed as Fire Elemental)*
*   **Philindra Sprawlweaver:** Owner of the "Mystical Scripts Scroll" shop in the Market District. Professional, friendly woman. *(Not encountered Session 5-8)*.
*   **Cedric ("The Champ"):** Large, muscular man (pugilist build), champion of the Spit and Swallow fighting pit. Initially wore simple hand wraps; post-transformation, fists and forearms appear wrapped in inlaid gold, part of his skin/tattoos. Wears a waist chain/rosary with an iron symbol of a right hand (palm outward, curled fingers - Hand of God symbol). Initially stoic, becomes respectful/apologetic after defeat, missing teeth.
    *   **Abilities & Curse:** Challenged the party after their pit victories. Possesses significant power linked to the Isoptric Curse. Can unleash energy to heal/empower others (leveled party to 4). In combat, uses multi-attack (fists, kick), Calculated Loss (bonus action move/debuff), legendary actions for extra attacks, inflicts delayed radiant damage, and applies conditions (Stun via Tunnel Vision, Action Denial via Out of Breath) on hits via CON saves. Under pressure, underwent a transformation: radiant energy pulsed, veins glowed, eyes shone, forearms gained golden inlay, power increased but control seemed diminished (similar to Fire Elemental transformation). Claimed to channel power from the goddess Viteo, but the transformation felt unprecedented/uncontrolled to him.
    *   **Hand of God Connection:** Confirmed affiliation with the "Hand of God" cult, acting as a "scouter" finding talent for them. Provided the party with the cult's base location (a chapel basement in the Dawn District) and gave them his Hand symbol token as a potential means of access/introduction. Became defensive when pressed by Leopold about direct involvement. **Spotted by Leopold attending Father Kallor's sermon at the Court of Viteo. Xander (cultist) later confirmed Cedric recruits for the cult.**
    *   *(Status: Defeated by party, provided information & token, remains at Spit and Swallow, known to frequent Court of Viteo)*
*   **High Cleric Father Kallor:** *(New Key NPC)* Old, frail-appearing public figure (poofs of gray hair, smacking lips, obscured eyes, large gray-brown robes, carries a large chained tome); privately, his posture is straighter. High Cleric of the Court of Viteo in the Dawn District, running for a council seat. Publicly delivered a sermon about blessings, his council run, recent attacks by religious folk desecrating Viteo's symbol, and concern for missing poor folk. Claimed to be working with Legionnaires. When approached by the party, he granted them access to the chapel's courtyard/mausoleum area to investigate the cult. Provided leads to other, less secure Viteo chapels and reluctantly wrote a letter of introduction for Kaladin. Showed frustration when examining the party's Hand of God talisman. His true knowledge of the cult operating beneath his chapel is unknown. *(Status: Active at the Court of Viteo)*
*   **Xander (Cultist Groundskeeper):** *(New Key NPC)* "Devilishly handsome" male with Tiefling-esque features. Publicly a groundskeeper at the Court of Viteo, tending rose bushes. Secretly a member and gatekeeper for "The Hand of God" cult. When the party approached the mausoleum, he tested them with a "justice or wrath?" question (Kaladin answered "justice"). Later charmed by Leopold (failed Wisdom save, Nat 2). Under charm, he confirmed "wrath" was the correct answer, expressed trust in Leopold (but not his friends), and gave Leopold his key to the mausoleum. Was then convinced by Leopold to leave the grounds and was subsequently abducted by the party and taken to a Legionnaire holding cell. During interrogation (after charm wore off), he revealed the Hand of God cult operates in extensive tunnels beneath the main Viteo chapel, has hundreds of members (many poor folk "fed" by the leader), and is led by "The Reverend."

## Important Events So Far

*   **Induction into the Stonewall Legionnaires:** Kaladin, Leopold, and Zariel attended Legionnaire tryouts, revealed potent 'Isoptic Curse' abilities, attracted high-level interest, collectively defeated a cursed Fire Elemental, and accepted offers to join the Legionnaires.
*   **Festival Attack and Rise of "The Hand of God":** During a public festival celebrating an Omen Knight expedition to Moonhaven (enabled by the newly activated Arcane Splitter), a monstrous werewolf attacked Legionnaires outside the dome while extremist cultists, identified as "The Hand of God," simultaneously launched a coordinated assault from within the festival. The party played a crucial role in defending citizens and neutralizing several cultists. This event revealed a dangerous new internal threat and led to the party's new primary mission to hunt down the cult.

## Ongoing Mysteries & Goals

*   What is the full nature, origin, and range of effects of the Isoptic Curse? (Note: Stress Point activation observed - Zariel used 3 total; Leopold 1 used; Kaladin 1 used. Cedric demonstrated significant power increase, transformation (radiant energy, physical changes), enhanced abilities, but also apparent loss of control, linking it to Viteo worship. Cost/drawbacks still largely unknown, though Cedric's "Next Round" ability imposes halved max HP.)
*   What are the details surrounding Zariel's memory loss and 'accident'? What is the significance of his dream of stasis/medical care? (Note: Metallic sheen. Legionnaire medical facility felt "somewhat familiar". Repeated near-death experiences. New dream fragment reinforces medical/experimental origin: table, light, monitor, "This one's awake, put him out," "inform [blank] Council member. Project is underway.")
*   What happened during Leopold's past (deactivation, memory issues)? What is the story behind his "Bone Grinder" emblem? Was his brother truly an Omen Knight named Victor? What did his dream signify? (Note: Memory flash confirmed past potion-making link. Memory flash linked pit fighting to "blood pits," "Father," and brother "Victor" getting promoted to "captain." Felt recognition with Blackguard Knight. Library research yielded little. Encountered library scribe named Victor Holloway. **Spotted "Dome Exploration" assignment on Legionnaire job board.**) *(New Info)*
*   What were Kaladin's specific dreams motivating him? What is the nature of his connection to the Feywild/past lives hinted at in dreams/vision? (Note: Potent Fey magic discovered. Researched Feywild history. Experienced vision connecting him to woman. Still feels strong connection to fey woman's mask. Had disturbing dream of spider-creature. New dream featured field turning to bones/skulls, dark pit with cloth walls, and a voice demanding "Let me out.")
*   What are the potential consequences or drawbacks of using Stress Points? (Note: Power demonstrated, 3 used by Zariel, 1 by Leopold. Cost remains unknown. Zariel collapsed after using two in Session 6.)
*   Who was the figure Kaladin saw watching him before the tryouts?
*   What is the significance of Zariel's red-tipped orchid?
*   How common is the Isoptic Curse? How is it perceived? (Note: Thurr actively recruiting/testing. First case recorded. Cedric is another example, potentially recruited by cult.)
*   What is the full power structure of the Stonewall Legionnaires and New New Arbor? What is the significance of the Omen Knights and Alabaster Lords? (Note: Omen Knights confirmed elite. Thurr commands "Blackguard" unit. Mysterious female voice could command Thurr. Zariel's dream mentioned a "[blank] Council member" connected to a "Project". **High Cleric Father Kallor is running for a council seat.**) *(New Info)*
*   What is the significance of Captain Levi's meeting regarding another domed city? (Note: Related to Moonhaven mission, which was attacked.)
*   What is the nature and origin of the Myconids in the Fungal Tunnels? What is their goal? (Note: Assimilate victims, guarded Fey presence. Lancex was test subject. Source/motive unknown.)
*   Where are the missing people from the Storm District? (Note: Lancex found. Others unknown. "Hand of God" cult now a factor. **Father Kallor reported missing poor folk from the Dawn District who used to frequent his chapel for rations; the Hand of God cult is known to recruit such individuals.**) *(New Info)*
*   Is Selena Sal involved with, complicit in, or ignorant of the Myconid/Fey activity beneath her shop?
*   What is the significance of the small film reel Leopold received?
*   What will happen on Leopold's arranged "date" with Marcel the Hermit Crab?
*   Who/what is the mysterious woman found on the altar? What is the purpose/nature of her plant-filled mask and connection to Fey magic? (Note: Mask vital. Transferred to Legionnaire care; party has access. Thurr studying her. Kaladin feels connection. Zariel felt familiarity/connection. Kaladin's vision suggests she's from outside dome. Kaladin's latest dream ("Let me out") strengthens connection to a trapped entity potentially linked to her.)
*   Who is the "he" that Lancex warned is "coming for her"? (Note: Phrase echoed in Kaladin's first nightmare. Kaladin's latest dream voice ("Let me out") is likely the same entity.)
*   What is the full extent and origin of the Fey magic presence in the Fungal Tunnels?
*   What are the Omen Knights' specific roles, powers, and allegiances? (Note: Elite squad sent to Moonhaven, ambushed. Thurr's "Blackguard" Knight deployed; Leopold felt recognition, possible link to Victor.)
*   What was the significance of the Albatross blood drawing ("one for sorrow") found in the tunnels?
*   What is the creature from Kaladin's dream? (Note: Original dream involved spider-like creature. New dream involved a pit and voice.)
*   What truly happened to Moonhaven to cause its silence? (Note: Omen Knight mission launched, immediately attacked. Status of Moonhaven itself unknown.)
*   What are the full capabilities and implications of Project Splitter (now Arcane Splitter)? (Note: Successfully created temporary dome opening. Revealed extreme danger outside dome.)
*   Who is the calm female voice that commanded Lord Marshall Thurr via comms? Why does Ratshit deny that Thurr was officially recalled?
*   What is the full extent, leadership, and ultimate goal of "The Hand of God" cult? Why did they attack the festival? (Note: **Operates from extensive hidden tunnels beneath the main Court of Viteo chapel in the Dawn District. Led by "The Reverend." Has "hundreds" of members, many recruited from desperate/poor populations (Cedric is a known recruiter). Uses a modified Viteo talisman (curled fingers) and a "justice/wrath" password system ("wrath" is their alignment). Mausoleum key has dual function (right turn = illusion, left turn = implied true access). Xander, a captured cultist, revealed these details and hinted at fanatical devotion and violent ideology ("purify me, desecrate you").**) *(New Info)*
*   What happened to Lord Marshall Thurr after his abrupt departure during the festival attack? Is he safe, and what was the nature of the summons he received?
*   What is the nature of Leopold's "click" of recognition with the Blackguard Knight? Is there a connection to his past, potentially his brother Victor? (Note: Memory flash potentially links Victor to promotion and "blood pits." Encountered scribe Victor Holloway in Core Library.)
*   What will the Omen Knights (and the deployed Blackguard) find at Moonhaven, and what will be their ultimate fate against the werewolf and other potential external threats?
*   Why did the Legionnaire medical facility feel "somewhat familiar" to Zariel, and does it connect to his lost memories or nature? (Note: Dream reinforces connection to medical/experimental setting and a "Project".)

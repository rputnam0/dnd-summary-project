Our tale resumes, dear friends, not with the clash of steel, but with the hushed, determined whispers of heroes steeling themselves for a descent into shadow. The newly dubbed “O’dears,” fresh from the brutal revelations of the Spit and Swallow, knew their quarry: the insidious cult known as “The Hand of God.” But before plunging into the Dawn District’s pious heart, prudence—and the need for sturdier hides—called.

First, a debrief with their ever-cynical handler, Ratshit. Kaladin, ever the diligent leader, laid out their findings: Cedric’s confession, the chapel lead. He even broached the subject of a gear upgrade, a request met with Ratshit’s characteristic charm—or lack thereof. "You get like one voucher," he’d drawled, unimpressed by Kaladin’s impromptu spear-staff demonstration, though a flicker of something akin to respect might have crossed his features. Leopold, ever the hopeful “apprentice,” offered his "wizardry with paperwork," only to be met with a brusque, “You are my fucking subordinate. Get the fuck out of here.” Some things, it seemed, never changed.

Next, the familiar, smoky air of Hamhawk’s forge in the Storm District. Kaladin, with newfound gold, commissioned a sturdier, darker blue and brown leather armor, accented with brushed nickel half-plate. Zariel, too, sought an upgrade, envisioning his studded leather now interwoven with wickedly sharp thorns amongst the living vines. Hamhawk, gruff but efficient, agreed to the work, her usual annoyance at Leopold’s “apprentice” claims barely concealed. “You are not… my apprentice. Let’s get that clear,” she rumbled, yet Leopold, with unwavering optimism, later confided to his companions, "I let him do that because it makes him feel better." The ogre-like smith also confirmed Kaladin's suspicions: potions and rings of protection were market finds or rewards for true valor, not workshop commissions. As they departed, Zariel’s keen eye caught a glimpse of a complex blueprint pinned to Hamhawk’s private workbench, a silent testament to projects yet unknown.

Their armors augmented, the O’dears ventured into the Dawn District, a realm bathed in an almost preternatural golden light. Here, piety hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the Storm District’s perpetual gloom. Kaladin, scanning for any sign of the cult’s perverted iconography, was guided by Zariel’s subtle blessing when his eyes fell upon a portly vendor hawking Viteo talismans. "I can tell you are in need of faith, my friend," the man boomed, but his theatrics dropped when Kaladin inquired about symbols with curled fingers. Shown the party's token, the vendor recoiled. “Viteo, judge me just! That is, in fact, one of mine… I guess somebody is, in fact, bending the tips of the fingers.” He knew nothing more of who, only that his main business was near the grand Court of Viteo, the high cleric allowing his sales for a share of the profits. Leopold, ever prepared, purchased three more, his robotic fingers later expertly bending them to match their sinister clue.

Seeking disguises, Zariel’s sharp perception, again bolstered by Kaladin’s guidance, led them to Serafina, a humble robe vendor with a kind smile and a young daughter, Amber, at her side. Zariel, with his typical endearing awkwardness – “Well, me being the suave, charismatic person that I am…” he’d mumbled before his fumbling approach – purchased three simple tan robes. Serafina spoke with heartfelt gratitude of High Cleric Father Kallor of the Court of Viteo, a man who had “saved me from becoming homeless.” Her genuine praise painted a picture of a benevolent shepherd, a detail the party filed away.

A brief, unsettling detour took them to the “House of the Devil,” a gloomy sanctuary dedicated to Renan, Lord of Destruction. The gaunt, unnaturally smooth guide, Varik, offered a tour of its grim murals and shadowed altars, a place of worship for those spurning the mainstream gods. Kaladin’s investigation, despite a fervent prayer to the dice gods, yielded a critical failure; no sign of the Hand of God here.

Thus, all paths led to the Court of Viteo. As they approached the magnificent chapel, its vaulted ceilings echoing with faint, holy music, they donned their robes, Leopold melodramatically lamenting his fictitious “burns.” Inside, they joined the congregation for High Cleric Father Kallor’s sermon. The aged cleric, a frail figure with eyes mostly hidden beneath bushy brows, spoke of his bid for a council seat, of recent desecrations of Viteo’s holy symbol by unknown zealots, and, most notably, of his concern for the growing number of poor folk who had stopped visiting his chapel for rations. Leopold, ever watchful, spotted none other than Cedric, the pit champion, amongst the devout attendees.

After the sermon, the party approached Father Kallor. At the mention of their Legionnaire status, the cleric’s posture seemed to straighten, a subtle shift from his public frailty. He expressed surprise at the depth of their knowledge regarding the cult impersonating Viteo’s followers. "It's worse than I thought," he’d murmured, granting them access to the chapel’s rear courtyard and the mausoleum therein. He even, with some reluctance after Kaladin’s gentle prodding (and a gold coin slipped into the donation box), penned a letter of introduction to other chapels. Zariel, touched by Serafina’s plight, left a generous ten gold for her with the cleric.

The courtyard was a tranquil space of manicured rose bushes and solemn gravestones, leading to a sunken stone mausoleum. Two groundskeepers, the devilishly handsome, tiefling-esque Xander and a hulking, orcish figure named Haggard, barred their path. "We need to get into the mausoleum," Kaladin stated, "and we have the blessings of Kallor to enter."
Xander, his eyes glinting as they caught the modified talisman on Kaladin’s belt, posed a chilling question, his voice smooth yet laced with an unspoken challenge: "I will let you in, but I have to ask… do you prefer justice, or do you prefer wrath?"
A hush fell. Kaladin, after a moment’s thought, declared, "For justice."
Zariel, his intuition screaming, felt a pang of doubt; Leopold’s earlier musings in the bar about Viteo being a god of wrath echoed in his mind. Xander, with a polite nod, turned a key in the mausoleum lock – *to the right*. Kaladin’s arcane senses, sharpened to a razor’s edge by sheer chance, caught a subtle flash of magic as the door creaked open, and the undeniable impression that the key could have turned *left*. The path offered, it seemed, was not the only one.

The party hesitated. The door led into darkness, but the air was thick with misdirection. Zariel’s attempt to re-engage Xander by mentioning Cedric fell flat. A new plan, audacious and risky, began to form. Leopold, under the guise of needing to "stretch it out before I drop a load," slipped away, his Magical Tinkering soon producing a series of… *unconventional* sounds from a nearby hedge. "What is happening?" Kaladin muttered, utterly bewildered by the sudden chorus of what could only be described as "very steamy sex."
As Xander and Haggard, thoroughly annoyed, moved to investigate the bizarre disturbance, Leopold saw his chance. He emerged, attempting to charm them both. Xander, with a roll that could only be fate’s cruel jest, succumbed entirely, a playful, almost dazed look replacing his suspicion. Haggard, however, resisted, his orcish blood boiling, and hefted his shovel, ready to strike.
"Haggard, no!" Xander, now seeing Leopold as a dear, if eccentric, friend, stepped between them. Zariel, seizing the moment, smoothly de-escalated, apologizing for Leopold’s “excitement.” Kaladin, meanwhile, cast a subtle Bless upon his companions.

With Haggard temporarily pacified, Leopold drew Xander aside. "As you see, my friend here, he prefers justice," Leopold began, "but I myself find the wrath more interesting." He flashed his own modified talisman.
Xander’s devilish grin returned. "You got the password wrong," he confided, now an ally. "But if you do mean it… you are a follower of Wrath." He trusted Leopold implicitly, but his friends? That required more convincing. A silver-tongued plea from Leopold, bolstered by Kaladin's blessing, barely swayed Xander to trust them, or at least, not to immediately betray Leopold for associating with them. Xander offered Leopold entry, but not his companions. "It'll be my ass. And I do mean this literally, they will kill me."
Thinking quickly, Leopold feigned a sudden fascination with Xander’s key, and the charmed groundskeeper, eager to please his new “friend Frederick,” handed it over. With the key secured, Leopold then persuaded the befuddled Xander that they had urgent business elsewhere, and Xander, believing he was simply taking an early half-day with a trusted associate, readily agreed to accompany them.

The journey back to the Core was a masterclass in hurried evasion, Zariel’s survival instincts guiding them through the city’s thrumming arteries at a desperate pace. Just as the charm on Xander began to fray, their Legionnaire robes revealed, they bundled him into a holding cell. The spell broke, and Xander erupted. "I fucking knew it! You couldn't be trusted! You were my friend!" he spat, before his threats took a darker turn. "You count your days! The Reverend is coming for you, and he'll make you pay!"
Stripped of his concealed short sword and his own hidden, bent-fingered talisman, Xander faced his interrogators. Leopold, in a comically aggressive “bad cop” routine involving a pipe and a strategically placed “duty maker” that emitted a startling fart sound, failed to break him. It was Kaladin’s calmer, persuasive approach, offering a sliver of hope amidst despair, that finally loosened Xander’s tongue.
The words that followed painted a terrifying picture. Cedric, Xander confirmed, was indeed a recruiter. The Hand of God operated from extensive tunnels deep beneath the very Court of Viteo they had just left. There were *hundreds* of them, many the desperate poor folk Father Kallor had lamented, all fed and led by a figure known only as "The Reverend."
"You walk in there unannounced and uninvited," Xander rasped, his bravado cracking, "I don't care how powerful you are. You're up against a million rats. You're dead."
Then, something within him snapped. His eyes glazed, and he began to laugh, a wild, hysterical sound. "You don't understand! You're all dead men for what you've done! He will come! He will purify me, and he will desecrate you!" He collapsed into a litany of muttered pleas for forgiveness, a broken shell of a man.

The O’dears had their information, a chilling map to the heart of a fanatical army. They had a key, and the terrible knowledge of what awaited them in the darkness beneath the Dawn District’s golden facade. The Hand of God was far larger, far more dangerous than they could have imagined, and "The Reverend" loomed, a faceless threat promising purification and desecration. Their next steps would require more than just courage; they would require a miracle, or perhaps, a strike team.

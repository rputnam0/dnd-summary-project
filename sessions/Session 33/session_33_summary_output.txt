The air in Moonhaven’s Alarian District was thick with the silence of centuries. Light, filtered through the shattered dome and the riot of unnaturally colored trees, painted the overgrown ruins in hues of pink and orange, a beautiful shroud for a city long dead. Here, in the former seat of government, the O’dears walked among ghosts. They stepped over the skeletons of those who had fled in the city’s final moments, their forms half-melted into the very stone, skulls sprouting macabre bouquets of wildflowers—a haunting testament to the brutal, swift end of an age. An eerie stillness pervaded the streets, broken only by the whistle of wind through a split bamboo reed and the crunch of the heroes’ own footsteps on overgrown paths.

Their goal was the Core Tower, the heart of the old High Council, where knowledge might have survived the ravages of time. The entrance itself was a test, a disembodied voice echoing from arcane conduits in the walls. “I have cities but no houses, forests but no trees, rivers but no water. What am I?” it challenged. It was Zariel, his mind ever turning, who provided the answer that stilled the thrumming blue energy of the trap. “I think we’re looking at one, aren’t we?” he murmured to his companions. “It’s a map.” With that, the tower granted them passage, though its welcome was laced with a warning: the individual levels of the High Council remained armed.

What followed was a perilous ascent through a tower of traps and secrets, each floor a reflection of its former master. In the Lord High Healer’s library, a maze of unlabeled scrolls hummed with anxious magic. It was Kaladen, closing his eyes and letting the arcane currents guide him, who plucked the correct tome from its shelf, disarming the room’s defenses and earning the party a prize of immense value: a Scroll of Teleport, a desperate escape route now tucked safely away.

The next floor held a darker trial. Leopold, ever the curious inventor, stepped forward to inspect a series of glass cages, only to vanish in a flash of light. A trap had sprung, swapping the artificer for a monstrous, serpent-like Guardian Naga. Kaladen and Cletus were forced into a desperate fight to save their friend. Kaladen’s spells erupted in sculpted blasts of fire, while Cletus’s guiding bolts of holy energy seared the creature’s flesh. The Naga retaliated, bathing Cletus in a column of divine fire, but his Embered Mane cloak flared, its legendary resilience turning a fatal blast into a mere sting. With a final, twin slash of his Light Splitter, Kaladen bisected the serpent, its two halves thudding to the floor as Leopold was unceremoniously ejected from his stasis cube. “Holy smokes,” the warforged sputtered, gears whirring. “What did I miss?”

Meanwhile, a different kind of stupor had claimed Zariel and Cyrus. Their quest for headwear—born of Zariel’s newfound self-consciousness over his bare, metallic scalp—had led them to the tower’s edge, where a psychic shriek had overwhelmed them, leaving them standing like statues. It was only when the others, sensing their companions’ distress through their telepathic bond, rushed to find them that they awoke, dazed and with no memory of the time lost.

Reunited, they delved deeper. In the Lord Marshal’s spartan war room, they found letters that painted the final, grim picture of Moonhaven’s fall. They learned the name of the Cursed King who had brought ruin upon the city: Tentherian. And they learned of his generals, the monstrous avatars of his power: a great phoenix, a horrendous arachnid, an enormous lupine beast, and a bull of purple flame. Two of these, the party realized, they had already sent to their final rest.

The opulence of the Master of Currency’s office greeted them next, a winding hall of mirrors. Leopold, ever bold, stepped in to test the trap, and a glass-like duplicate of himself lunged from a reflection. After shattering his hostile clone, Leopold, triumphant, made to rejoin his allies, only to run headfirst into a mirror he’d mistaken for an exit. The comical blunder proved fortuitous, however, as the shattered glass revealed a hidden alcove containing a fortune in gold and platinum.

This newfound wealth immediately found a purpose. In the Lord of Advancement’s workshop, they discovered a pristine, unenchanted suit of plate armor. Seeing Cletus’s dire need, Leopold and Kaladen set to work. With the skill of a master smith and the arcane grace of a potent enchanter, they combined their talents. Leopold drew upon the psionic soul of the Elder Brain trapped within his Searing Saber, weaving psychic resistance into the metal, while Kaladen sacrificed his own ongoing project, embedding a spell-storing ring into the chest plate. In a matter of hours, Cletus was clad in psychically-resistant armor, capable of unleashing fire and force at a moment's notice—a true bastion for the party.

Finally, they reached the tower’s apex: the office of the First Council, Alarian Duskblade. Here, after disabling a devious time-loop trap, they found the final pieces of the puzzle. In letters between Moonhaven’s council and New New Arbor’s, they uncovered the full, desperate gambit: the flooding of Moonhaven had been no accident. It was a meticulously planned trap, a sorcerous sleight-of-hand designed to use the rushing waters to banish the seemingly unstoppable Tentherian into the Astral Sea. And within these letters, another secret: a failsafe plan. A way to alter a druidic travel spell, not to the safety of another dome, but to a place of immense power and dread—the Tree of Death. For Kaladen, whose prophetic vision had named that very tree, the discovery was a thunderclap. A path to his destiny now lay before them.

As night fell over the ruins, the party gathered their thoughts, the weight of their discoveries heavy in the air. But the tower had one last secret to yield. Peering into the gloom of the district below, Cyrus’s sharp eyes caught movement. “Guys, this is fucked,” he hissed, his voice tight with alarm. “There’s a Medusa-looking motherfucker over there.” A massive, stumbling serpent with a writhing head of tentacles was moving through the trees.

The immediate danger below was eclipsed by a more pressing, distant dread. Seeking clarity, Zariel settled into a trance, his senses reaching across the continent to scry upon their former commander, Lord Marshall Thurr. The vision that greeted him was horrifying. He saw Thurr, not in command, but in his werewolf form—chained, collared, and slumped in a defeated heap within a familiar dungeon. Then, another figure stepped into the frame, his voice dripping with a cruel, southern-ish twang as he kicked the chained beast. “And here I thought this old dog could learn new tricks.” It was Captain Levi, their former ally, now clad in a superior uniform and armed with advanced, revolver-like crossbows. And as Levi walked away, Zariel heard him conversing with another voice—a voice identical to Lord Marshall Thurr’s.

The vision shattered, leaving a chilling reality in its wake. A coup had succeeded. Their home was in the hands of their enemies. Their allies were either prisoners or traitors, and a doppelganger wore the face of their former leader. Alone in the peak of a dead city, with a monster lurking in the shadows below and a war lost hundreds of miles away, the O’dears faced a terrible choice: to pursue a fey king’s prophetic destiny at the Tree of Death, or to turn back toward a home that would surely greet them not with open arms, but with cold iron and betrayal.

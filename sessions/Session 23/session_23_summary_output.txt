The psychic scream of the Elder Brain had fallen silent, replaced by the damp, echoing quiet of the alien tomb. In the aftermath of their hard-won victory, the O’dears, now five strong with the addition of the farm-folk Cletus and Cyrus, found their work was not yet done. Beyond the brine pool where the great mind had perished, three cocoons held the fate of their missing ally, Wesley, and his friends. Hope and horror mingled as they tore open the pods. Wesley, the harengon rogue, was unconscious but alive, as was a lithe, feline ranger named Darwin. But the third pod held only tragedy: the owlbear barbarian, Herb, was dead, his body a grotesque mockery of nature, already half-transformed into the very monstrosity they had just slain. With a gentle touch, Zariel stabilized the living, his druidic magic a quiet promise in the grim darkness.

After a fitful rest amidst the carnage, Wesley awoke with a gasp, his mind reeling. He looked at the party, his eyes wide with a terror that had not yet faded. “Tucker…” he stammered, the words catching in his throat, “his skin exploded… he turned into a squid monster. He captured us…” The final, grim confirmation of the kensu’s fate hung heavy in the air, a stark reminder of the price of their delay. There was nothing left for them in the ruins but ghosts.

Their path lay north, towards Wesley’s home, the village of Cottonwood. A six-day trek on foot, but Zariel and Cletus had a better idea. With a ripple of primal power, the two druids shed their forms. Zariel became a great eagle of iridescent, metallic feathers, while Cletus, after some debate, transformed into a giant, long-necked goose, honking with indignation as Leopold clambered onto his back. They took to the sky, soaring above the plains and forests, leaving the shadow of the mountain—and the dungeon within—far behind. That night, as the party rested, Cletus stood watch, his eyes catching a flicker in the heavens. It was a miniature sun, a blazing orb of red and orange fire, streaking silently above the clouds before vanishing into the distant darkness—a fleeting, beautiful, and deeply unsettling omen.

Two days of flight brought them to the edge of the Chiari Forest, where the settlement of Cottonwood nestled by a creek. It was a place of simple, rustic charm: wooden buildings with thatched roofs, lanterns hanging from ancient trees, and animal-folk of every kind going about their day. For Cletus, the cow-like firbolg, it was a homecoming he never knew he needed; for the first time, he was not the strange one. But for Leopold and Zariel, clad in gleaming metal, and for the human-like Kaladen and Cyrus, they were creatures from another world. Children gawked, and a small, snot-nosed rabbit-folk even walked up to Cyrus, pointing. "What are you?" the child asked in Sylvan, his ears twitching. "What's a funny animal ass?"

Seeking guidance, the party was pointed towards the town’s founder and shaman, the ancient tortle, Cornelius Rattleback. Acting on a child’s tip, Cyrus first made a stop at the Brusseled Thrush Market and Inn, returning with a new vegan leather satchel and, more importantly, a bottle of prune juice. They found Cornelius in his hobbled shack, a cozy, herb-scented haven filled with drying plants and papyrus scrolls. The ancient tortle, his shell adorned with trinkets and his staff crowned with a strange metal circlet, accepted their gifts with a toothless, knowing grin. The prune juice was appreciated, but when Cletus offered a mug of his signature lukewarm almond milk, the shaman’s eyes lit with a century of forgotten joy. “My God,” he rasped, “you milked an almond for this!”

Pleased with their offerings, Cornelius told his tale. Cottonwood was besieged. From the mountain to the east, hyena-like monsters—Gnolls—would descend with the fog, raiding and pillaging in the name of a great fire spirit they worshipped. This spirit, Cornelius warned, was no mere legend; it was a real, terrifyingly powerful creature that roosted on the mountain, the same fiery orb Cletus had seen in the night sky. But the old shaman held another, more personal story. He pointed a gnarled finger at Kaladen, sensing the fey energy clinging to him, and spoke of a crone who wanders the woods in a cabin on chicken legs. “She introduced herself to me as… the Baba Yaga,” Cornelius revealed, his voice low. “She blessed me with gifts of magic prowess at the cost that I would outlive anybody I ever loved.”

The party had found their new purpose. Cornelius offered a deal: gems for every Gnoll ear they brought him, and his own powerful staff if they could end the threat for good. They accepted without hesitation, sealing the pact over a curdled mixture of prune juice and almond milk they dubbed the "Almond Palmer," a drink Cornelius claimed was second only to another of his inventions: golf.

The next morning, after a night’s rest, the shaman blessed them, drawing symbols on their foreheads with red clay. A divine ward against death and a blessing of fortune settled upon them as they set out with Wesley as their guide, ascending the treacherous mountain path. The air grew thin, the trail narrowed, and the world fell away into a sea of clouds below. It was then they saw them: a patrol of six lizard-like Kobolds in worked metal armor, chattering in a language they didn't understand. The party had the element of surprise.

There was no debate. They were here for blood. As the Kobolds rounded a bend, the party struck. Kaladen’s `Mirror Image` shimmered into existence as Cletus’s `Moonbeam` seared the path. Before the enemy could even draw their weapons, Leopold moved with shocking speed. He grabbed the lead Kobold, hoisted it over his head, and with a grunt, suplexed it straight off the cliff’s edge into the misty abyss. The battle was a whirlwind of brutal efficiency. Zariel’s `Thunderwave` sent another Kobold scrambling for a handhold on the precipice, only for Cyrus—screaming, “We’re taking ears and making dollars!”—to dart in, slice off its ear, and kick it into the void. The remaining foes were cut down in moments, culminating in a final, stylish execution by Leopold’s rebuilt Steel Defender, Bone Crusher, who bisected the last Kobold with chilling, mechanical grace.

In the sudden silence, broken only by the howling wind, the party stood victorious, their hands full of grisly trophies. It was then that the realization dawned—these were Kobold ears. The Gnolls, and their fiery god, were still out there, waiting for them deeper in the mountain’s shadow. This was only the beginning.

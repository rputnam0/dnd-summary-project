The air in the chasm, thick with the silence of a thousand hushed spiders, crackled with anticipation. Below the O’dears, on a platform of impossibly resilient webbing, the challenger descended. No longer the colossal arachnid that had tested their might, but a new, horrifying form: a drider-esque creature, half-humanoid and half-monstrous spider, its one great marble-black eye promising a glorious death. The bargain had been struck. The trial of strength had been passed. Now came the true test.

Zariel was the first to act, his lips curling into a grim smile. With a pointed finger and a flash of transformative magic, Kaladen’s lithe elven form erupted into that of a Giant Ape, its fur a garish pattern of neon green and hot pink stripes, topped with a truly magnificent afro. The Spider Queen took this as the opening bell, and the battle for Moonhaven’s soul began.

The fight was a whirlwind of coordinated violence. Zariel, not to be outdone, shed his own form, becoming a swirling Fire Elemental that flew to the Queen’s flank, his very presence searing her carapace. From above, Cletus called down a pillar of cold, divine moonlight that burned the fiendish creature, a constant, agonizing pressure. Cyrus, now fully embracing the reckless life of an adventurer, danced in, his sword a blur. “My choker and the peace sign on my sword… they light up like a Care Bear stare,” he later explained, as a burst of holy energy exploded from his blade, a devastating Divine Smite that sent the Queen reeling.

She staggered, grievously wounded. As Cyrus raised his blade for the finishing blow, a thought, cold and sharp, cut through the din of battle. *How do you want to finish her… for now?*

The words were a prophecy. Cyrus’s blade sliced through the webbing beneath the Queen’s feet, and with a piercing shriek, she fell away into the darkness. But she did not plummet. She caught herself on the webs below, and as the heroes watched in horror, a swarm of smaller spiders rushed onto her form. She began to consume them, her wounds sealing, her body swelling, growing larger, more feral. Her one great eye split down the center, a sick purple-and-green light radiating from the new, linear pupil. With another, more terrible scream, the creature that rose was no mere drider. She was the Second Great General of the Cursed Army, and her gaze was death to all magic.

A 150-foot cone of anti-magic erupted from her eye, washing over the party. Their enchanted items went dormant. Kaladen’s haste flickered and died. Cletus’s moonbeam was snuffed out like a candle. Then came the eye rays. A beam of sickly light shot forth, and Kaladen’s ape form froze solid, paralyzed and helpless. The party’s strategy, so effective moments before, had been utterly shattered.

Panic gave way to desperate genius. “I'm going to jump in the fucking hole,” Cyrus declared, and without another thought, he swan-dived off the platform, plunging into the chasm to get beneath the anti-magic gaze.

Inspired by the sheer audacity, Leopold followed. “Having witnessed Cyrus dive off… and recognizing I'm never going to avoid this magic eye without being daring, I too am going to swan dive,” he thought, activating his Searing Saber mid-fall. The battle had become a chaotic, three-dimensional war against the walls of the abyss.

The Queen, frantic and enraged, lashed out. A telekinetic ray slammed into Leopold, but the tinkerer had built himself to be resilient. “How much does Leopold weigh?” the universe seemed to ask. The answer—four hundred and fifty-five pounds—was enough. His immense weight anchored him to the wall, and the force that would have flung any other man into the void dissipated uselessly. Cyrus, however, was not so fortunate. He was snatched by an invisible force and hurled thirty feet down into the darkness.

The fight became a blur of clutch saves and desperate maneuvers. Zariel, using his Isoptic Curse, absorbed a devastating blow meant for Leopold, his elemental form dimming as he took the hit. Cletus, from his perch above, became a beacon of hope, sending down massive waves of healing that kept his allies in the fight. Cyrus, after being thrown, made a spectacular 60-foot climb back up the webbing in a single, desperate scramble.

The end came in a flurry of blows. Kaladen, breaking free of his paralysis, climbed onto the General’s back and unleashed a torrent of haymakers, the ape’s fists dealing a staggering 74 points of damage. The Queen was broken, cornered. Leopold saw his chance. Scurrying around her massive form, he began to systematically hack at her legs with his Searing Saber. As the last leg was severed and she began to fall, he plunged his blade straight through her heart. A blast of light erupted from her back, her life force draining into the glowing weapon.

Her body did not simply die; it crumpled inward, distorting and breaking at impossible angles, absorbing into itself until all that remained was the single, marble-black eye. It hung in the air for a moment, then began to fall.

As his allies scrambled, Cyrus’s reflexes, honed by a dozen near-death experiences, took over. With a motion so quick it was almost a blur, he snatched the relic from the air, a perfect, impossible catch.

Below, the innumerable spiders began to feast on the shed carapace of their former queen. The party knew their welcome had expired. With a shared glance, they leaped into the chasm, Cyrus’s magic catching them in a gentle `Feather Fall`. They descended nearly two hundred feet, landing softly in an ancient, unlit Elven service tunnel. Cyrus lit his sword, casting a pale glow on finely carved archways that disappeared into an oppressive darkness. The General was dead, but they were now deeper in the shattered city than ever before, and the source of Moonhaven’s sorrow was still waiting.

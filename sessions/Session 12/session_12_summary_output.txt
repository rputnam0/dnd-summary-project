Our tale resumes, dear listeners, not within the familiar, structured confines of New New Arbor’s Southern Dome, but out in the wilds of Avarias, a land the O’dears—Kaladen, Leopold, and Zariel—had been led to believe was naught but desolation. Yet, as they ventured forth from the subterranean river that had been their escape route, they found a world throbbing with unexpected life, a vibrant tapestry of blue skies and verdant growth that cast a long shadow of doubt upon the official narratives. Their Legionnaire technology, tellingly, had fallen silent.

Their immediate goal was to investigate the aftermath of the recent battle near the Arcane Splitter, but the wilderness, it seemed, had other plans. Leopold, ever the keen-eyed (if sometimes overly ambitious) observer, had strayed towards a boggy marsh. There, a monstrous amphibian, a creature the size of a small house with a tongue that crackled with raw lightning, was in the midst of hunting giant beetles. “Gents,” Leopold chirped, a glint in his optical sensors, “fancy a ride back to the dome?” Zariel, ever the pragmatist, wisely suggested caution and a hasty retreat behind a nearby tree, a sentiment Kaladen echoed. But Leopold, perhaps seeing a unique transport opportunity or simply intrigued by the challenge, had other ideas. A clumsy step sent a loud splash through the murky water, and the colossal frog’s multifaceted eye swiveled, locking onto him. “Easy there, boy!” Leopold called out, pulling forth his All or Nothing Coin. With a flick, the coin spun skyward. "Heads," he'd wagered, and as the coin landed true, Leopold, with a surge of improbable grace, bounded across the bog and onto the creature's haunch, scrambling onto its back.

The battle that ensued was a chaotic ballet of tooth, claw, spell, and steel. Zariel, with a roar, shifted into his now-signature bowler-hatted bear form, his claws wreathed in spectral flame, tearing into the beast. Kaladen, after a few errant firebolts that zipped wide, found his footing, Misty Stepping to flank the creature, his new blade, Light Splitter, drinking in the ambient light before lashing out with necrotic energy. Leopold, clinging precariously to the thrashing behemoth, unleashed a torrent of Burning Hands down its back, the flames met with a surprisingly muted reaction from the creature, though his hurled Magic Stones found their mark with greater effect. The frog retaliated fiercely, its lightning-fast tongue lashing out to grapple Zariel, who took a punishing blow that nearly sent him sprawling. Kicked and battered, Zariel reverted to his elven form, but with a defiant gesture, he called down the heavens. A swirling black cloud manifested, and crackling bolts of lightning slammed into the frog, not only searing its flesh but, more crucially, leaving it discombobulated and sluggish, its electrical nature turned against it.

The fight wore on, a desperate exchange. Leopold summoned his Steel Defender, a smaller, clanking echo of himself, which bravely engaged the monster. Kaladen, frustrated by a string of misses, finally landed a potent Chromatic Orb, thundering against the beast. The tide turned when Leopold, knocked from his perch, conceived a daring maneuver. "Zariel, I'm coming to help you!" he declared, and with a guttural whirring of gears, he launched his Steel Defender via a Catapult spell. The metal construct, spinning like a corkscrew, slammed into the monstrous frog. Yet, it was Leopold’s final, precisely aimed Magic Stone, zipping past the still-reeling defender, that found the creature’s eye. The stone punched through, and an instant later, the catapulted Steel Defender, sword first, blasted clean through the frog’s head, erupting in a shower of ichor and swamp water.

In the sudden quiet, broken only by the chirping of unseen insects, the party caught their breath. Investigation of the fallen behemoth yielded unsettling clues: tattered shreds of fine silk, clearly from worked clothing, were snagged on its hide, and more disturbingly, Leopold fished a well-made boot – of a style common within the dome – from its gullet. “This fella has been eating somebody with footwear,” Leopold observed, the implication hanging heavy in the air. This wasn't the refuse of some ancient, forgotten foray; this was recent.

“Seems to me,” Zariel mused, his voice heavy with dawning certainty, “that a ruling class’s ability to keep an entire population completely cut off from the rest of the world would be a tremendous source of control… What are the odds that we open the door one time and everybody dies and then…we just make our way out some random spot and it’s like beautiful? I don’t trust these guys.” Kaladen, ever practical, proposed their alibi: “If we go back upstream all the way and just say we were lost in the caverns, you know, communications did not work. It’s like a maze down there.” The O’dears were united; the truth of their excursion would remain their own.

With Zariel’s Pass Without Trace cloaking their approach, they skirted the massive, opaque curve of the Southern Dome, heading towards the Market District exterior, the site of the Arcane Splitter’s activation. The air grew thick with a looping, pre-recorded Legionnaire broadcast: “Adventuring party O’dears, report in. Lost contact, time span two days.” The signs of the werewolf’s rampage were evident: discarded weaponry, torn cloth, but no bodies. Then, Kaladen, his elven eyes piercing the gloom, spotted it – a lone figure, slumped against the dome wall, unmoving. With a stealth that bordered on the supernatural, Kaladen glided closer. It was the Blackguard Knight, the imposing obsidian-armored warrior Thurr had dispatched. Its abdomen was torn open, not revealing gore, but an intricate, advanced system of clockwork gears and arcane conduits, a design chillingly reminiscent of Leopold’s own, yet far more sophisticated. And as Kaladen gingerly lifted the Knight’s faceplate, there was no face, only a blank slate, upon which was inscribed an iron gauntlet crushing a skull, with the words “Bone Crusher” etched above – an exact match to the emblem hidden upon Leopold’s own back.

“He appears to be made of the same stuff you are,” Kaladen reported, his voice hushed, as he led Leopold and Zariel back to the silent sentinel. The revelation struck Leopold like a physical blow. This advanced Warforged, bearing his mark… it was a profound, disorienting piece of his forgotten past. The decision was swift: the Knight’s chassis and its massive greatsword, found embedded in a nearby tree, were carefully hauled into Zariel’s Pocket Workshop, a battered red toolbox that opened into an extradimensional sanctuary.

Within the workshop's confines, as evening drew in, Kaladen felt the familiar pull of the Fey Woman's mask. “I think I’m going to try to put the mask on,” he announced, a tremor of anticipation in his voice. “Perhaps just keep an eye on me.” Despite Zariel’s gentle warning about the fate of its previous wearers, Kaladen trusted the connection he felt. As the plant-filled mask settled over his face, it seemed to suction into place. Leopold and Zariel watched, stunned, as Kaladen lifted from the ground, his elven ears elongating, sharpening to delicate points, his platinum hair shot through with hints of forest green, his entire frame growing taller, more lithe, an ethereal glow emanating from beneath his sealed eyelids.

For Kaladen, the world dissolved. He heard a woman’s voice, a “nice southern drawl,” speaking of a world soon to be a “big mess,” of his own importance, addressing him as “Cal.” He experienced millennia flashing past – the birth and death of forests, wastelands, and verdant fields – until he found himself in a lush, fey-touched haven, water flowing uphill, the sky a soft pink. Before him stood the woman from the altar, her mask gone, revealing pointed, fey features. “Don’t be silly, you know me,” she said, a quizzical look crossing her face when he failed to recognize her. “My name is Faye, Faye Lara… Doesn’t seem as though you are quite yourself yet. That’s okay. I think we’ve all got time to wait for you.”

When Kaladen returned to himself, dropping to the workshop floor with a thud, minutes had passed for his companions, an eternity for him. The fey transformation remained, his appearance now strikingly, undeniably elven, bordering on the Fae. The sight of this new, more ancient Kaladen triggered a memory in Leopold: a flash of himself and his brother Victor, standing beside a mentor, a strikingly pureblood elven gentleman. The mask, Kaladen discovered, now felt attuned to him, a part of him. He mused it might be called “Breath of the Wild.”

As the O’dears settled for a long rest, Leopold, driven by an insatiable curiosity, attempted to examine one of the Blackguard Knight’s power cores. A sharp zap and five points of shock damage were his reward. “Hmm, tamper-proof mechanism on this thing,” he muttered, sparks dancing harmlessly off his Witchbolt antenna. “It’s going to be a little bit more difficult to figure out than I initially thought.”

Their rest, however, was to be short-lived. As they prepared to leave the workshop and begin the long trek back through the river tunnels, Zariel, rolling for an encounter, grimaced. A natural one. The wilds of Avarias, it seemed, were not yet finished with the O’dears, and the shadows stirred, promising fresh dangers as our heroes stood on the precipice of the unknown.

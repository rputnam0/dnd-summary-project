The air in the deep places of Moonhaven was stale, thick with the scent of ancient silk and the damp chill of a drowned city. To navigate this sprawling, web-choked tomb, Zariel had shed his metallic skin, becoming a grotesque but effective scout: a giant spider of riotous pink and neon green, an absurd bumper sticker of a pattern on his abdomen declaring, "I break for the O'Dears." Through his borrowed arachnid senses, the party felt the thrum of the hive, a superhighway of countless skittering forms all serving a single, colossal presence at the web's heart.

As they crept deeper into the suffocating darkness, a voice, breathy and hoarse and distinctly feminine, slithered into Zariel’s mind. *Who are you?* it whispered. The question, relayed to the others, hung in the air, a promise of confrontation. Their silent advance was broken by a sudden clatter and a curse. Leopold, ever the bastion of warforged grace, had tripped, his armored boot catching on something hard. As a previously stowed rotisserie chicken tumbled from his chest cavity and skittered across the webbing, the party’s attention fell not on the spilled poultry, but on what he had found: a gorgeous, gold-cased scroll. Inscribed in elegant Elven, it read, "Map of Moonhaven."

With their prize secured, the O’dears pressed on, the tunnel finally opening into a vast, breathtaking cavern. Below them was a sheer drop into nothingness, the entire space dominated by a colossal column of web that descended into an inky abyss. And then, from the darkness, *she* emerged. A leg thicker than a man’s torso planted itself on the web, followed by another, and another, until her grotesque form, a mountain of chitin and malice, looked down upon them. A single, massive eye, black and unblinking, fixed on them all. *You found your way to the center,* the voice echoed in every mind now. *But I ask now what you seek.*

As Leopold stepped forward to act as diplomat, a strange quiet fell. Cletus and Zariel looked down to find themselves no longer spiders, but their normal selves, their Wild Shapes inexplicably gone. A dawning horror washed over them as they realized the air itself was hostile to their magic. The Queen’s lair was a dead zone, an anti-magic field. Zariel, ever the pragmatist, tested its limits with a clever ruse. "Oh, oh, oh lordy!" he cried, feigning a clumsy stumble and pitching himself over the edge. He was caught almost instantly by a massive, hairy leg that swooped from the darkness and gently placed him back on the ledge, but in that brief fall, he felt it: the rush of his own power returning, his enchantments flaring back to life before being snuffed out again. The field was powerful, but finite.

Leopold, undeterred, posed their query about the flood. The Queen was dismissive. The water was an inconvenience to her new kingdom, but she seemed to sense they sought more. "What kind of entertainment are you interested in?" Leopold asked, earnestly offering a song or a dance.

The Queen’s massive head snapped towards him, the web vibrating with the movement. Her one great eye filled his vision. *Powerful you seem,* she hissed in his mind. *How many of my young could you kill?* She revealed a glimpse of her past—a human general, a survivor of a fallen world who had claimed this ruin as her own. This was a being who understood only one language. "It's been long since these bones have moved," she rasped. "If you are worthy, I will gift you my source and you'll be on your way. But if you lose..." The chittering clack of her many mandibles finished the thought.

It was a trial by combat, an exhibition of power. The party accepted. One by one, they would face her endless brood and show their strength.

Kaladen went first. With a word and a gesture, a crackling orb of fire erupted, a critical blow that vaporized dozens of spiders in a flash. He followed with blasts of raw magic and sweeps of his soulwood-hilted blade, a whirlwind of arcane destruction that tallied 84 souls for the Queen’s bloody count.

Then came Leopold. "Bone Crusher," he commanded, "fuck that guy up." As his Steel Defender charged, Leopold unleashed hell. But this was more than just a battle; it was a revelation. As he fought, his fifth Stress Point ignited. His warforged frame glowed with an internal, furious red light, and from his back sprouted new, terrifying appendages—gleaming mechanical arms that whirled and stabbed in a perfect, lethal tandem with his searing saber. He became, as his curse fully manifested, a spinning ball of blades, a one-man army of choreographed death, racking up a staggering 123 kills.

Cletus and the ever-eager Cyrus followed, one a conduit of righteous, searing power, the other a flurry of sword-flourishes, adding another 187 to the pyre. But the Queen's invisible threshold had not yet been met. All eyes turned to Zariel.

He met their gaze, and then he *grew*. Bones cracked and reshaped as he assumed the form of a Tyrannosaurus Rex. But he did not bite or claw. Instead, with a guttural roar, he simply rolled. He became a living steamroller of flesh and fury, crushing spiders by the score beneath his immense weight, their carapaces popping like bubble wrap. His initial onslaught was devastating, 155 kills, yet somehow, it fell just short. With a surge of will, Zariel pushed himself, tapping into his eighth Stress Point. A wave of power surged through him, his muscles coiling tighter, his mass impossibly denser. He rolled again, and this time, the number was undeniable: 175. He had passed the trial.

The swarming spiders halted. The monstrous Queen descended, her voice resonating with something akin to respect. *Well done. You will be an excellent feast.* With a surprising grace, she plucked five glowing potions from her web and laid them before the party. "I am not a cruel sovereign," the voice in their minds explained. "I mean to heal you. I would not rob myself of a challenge."

It was a gamble. Cletus, ever the farmer, took it first, downing his potion in one gulp. "Holy fuck," he breathed, his eyes wide with wonder, "does it taste like almonds?" A wave of warmth and power washed over him. He felt stronger, renewed. Seeing his success, the others quickly followed, each chugging the potent elixir. They felt their spell slots return, their wounds mend, and a new, deeper well of power open within them. They had all, in that moment, ascended to a new level of strength.

*Good,* the Queen’s voice echoed, and then, for the first time, she spoke aloud, her voice a guttural growl that shook the very air. "Because I was so hungry."

The massive spider form before them began to crack and contort. The grotesque abdomen split open, bathing the cavern in a sickening green light. From within the shattered husk, a new form emerged—smaller, sleeker, and infinitely more terrifying. It was a centipede-like amalgam of humanoid and spider, wielding a nasty, serrated sword, its single great eye glowing with malevolent intelligence. The trial was over. The feast was about to begin.

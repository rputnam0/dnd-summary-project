And so, our intrepid O'Dears, fresh from the bewildering teleport that had flung them far from the familiar (if chaotic) confines of New New Arbor, found themselves thrust into the untamed heart of Avarias’s northern wilderness. The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, was soon rent by the snarls of unseen predators. No sooner had Zariel, his metallic form already beginning to shimmer with an inner heat as he invoked a *Fire Shield*, uttered a warning, than combat was upon them. Kaladen, ever prepared, wove duplicates of himself with a *Mirror Image*, while Leopold, kneeling, unleashed his trusty Steel Defender, Bone Crusher, from the intricate gears of his back. "Bonecrusher, provide artillery support!" Leopold commanded, his voice tight, "I'm taking the flank!"

The first wave of attackers – a pair of grotesque beasts, one a blur of displacing fur and feline tail, the other a shambling horror of boils and oozing ichor – fell to a coordinated assault. Zariel, a furious bear of shimmering metal and righteous flame, tore into the displacer beast. Kaladen’s *Isoptric Blasts* seared the air, one finding a critical mark on the ghoul-like commander, even as its noxious spray forced Leopold and Zariel to recoil, their forms resisting the worst of the poison. With a final, precisely aimed *Firebolt* from Bone Crusher, the displacer creature crumpled, followed swiftly by its master, Kaladen’s arcane energies imploding it from within. "How do you want to do this?" the DM might have cackled, but Kaladen merely described the gruesome end: "I think these blasts would have just been centered right through that oozing open gap and just exploded on the inside."

A momentary quiet descended, broken only by the party’s ragged breaths and a faint, unsettling tremor in the earth beneath their feet. Leopold, ever the pragmatist, offered Kaladen a freshly-conjured (and partially-eaten) rotisserie chicken from his chest cavity. "Oh, Jesus, Zariel, what is this stuff?" he’d exclaimed earlier, flinging ichor from his arm. The ground’s vibration grew more insistent. Zariel, his senses attuned to the wild, felt a stirring beneath the very corpses they had just made.

Then, from the treeline, a frantic voice, speaking in the ancient Sylvan tongue: "Get the fuck out of the path!" A figure burst into view – a Harengon, a rabbit-man some four and a half feet tall, his furry brows furrowed in panic. He was Wesley, though they knew it not yet. His warning was dire, for even as he spoke, the ground beneath the slain troll erupted. An enormous insectoid horror, all chittering jaws, glossed-over blue eyes, and centipede-like legs – “Old Buck,” as Wesley would later call it – burst forth, swallowing the remains of their previous foes in a gruesome display before turning its attention to the living.

What followed was a desperate melee. Zariel, again a bear, charged, his claws raking the creature’s carapace. Kaladen unleashed a torrent of *Isoptric Blasts*, while Leopold, after a comically errant *Catapult* shot involving the aforementioned rotisserie chicken (“He he he,” Zariel chuckled as it missed), found his *Ice Knife* and Bone Crusher’s *Firebolt* frustratingly ineffective against the beast’s tough hide. "Jesus Christ," Leopold muttered, "This guy has got some beefy resistances." Wesley, to their surprise, manifested crackling pink psionic blades, leaping into the fray. The Remorhaz-like creature, a whirlwind of fangs and chitin, seized Zariel in its mighty jaws, the druid’s bear form vanishing in a shower of sparks. "Ow," came Zariel’s muffled voice as he was swallowed whole. Trapped within the beast’s gullet, taking corrosive damage, Zariel, with grim determination, coated the creature’s insides with *Faerie Fire*, making it an easier target. "I don't feel too good," he’d later quip. Kaladen, seeing his friend engulfed, unleashed a furious Action Surge, his Light Splitter and arcane blasts hammering the creature with such force that it was compelled to disgorge its unwilling meal. Finally, with a pair of devastating blows from his psionic blades, Wesley, the jittery rabbit-folk, ended the monstrous threat. "Yeah, you can kill it," Zariel had gasped, covered in stomach acid.

In the aftermath, an alliance was struck. Wesley, his initial panic giving way to earnestness, explained his plight: his friends had vanished near ancient, unexplored ruins. He needed help. "They're my best friends," he pleaded, "I'm happy to return any favor." The O'Dears, never ones to shy from a worthy cause (or a good mystery), agreed.

Wesley led them to his makeshift camp. As dusk settled, Zariel trained his newly adopted werewolf pups, their "hide" command improving. Leopold, ever tinkering, drafted blueprints to enhance Bone Crusher’s armor. Kaladen, meanwhile, poured his arcane focus into the Ring of Protection he was enchanting, significant progress made under the watchful stars. The night, however, was not entirely peaceful. Zariel, in his sleep, was visited by a strange, warm, guiding sensation, vivid images of ancient, vine-choked ruins filling his mind – a clear path laid out before him. He rose, eyes glazed, and began to walk, a silent automaton drawn by an unseen force. Kaladen, ever vigilant during his shorter elven trance, gently roused him. The vision was of the very ruins Wesley had described.

The next morning, guided by Zariel’s newfound sense and Wesley’s knowledge of the trail, they reached the forgotten stone structures. The air was heavy with age and forgotten magic. Inside, Leopold’s keen eye, after a moment of intense focus, discerned ancient carvings on a dusty wall – depictions of a lost culture of animal-like figures, dogs, cats, pigs, and cows, some on two legs, some on four. "Well," he mused, dusting off the fragile images, "I suppose this might be the origins of our pal here." Kaladen, meanwhile, noted ominous drag marks leading deeper into the gloom.

Zariel’s guiding sense led them to a side chamber where a grim discovery awaited: the complete skeleton of a large, rat-like humanoid, a perfectly carved hole in the back of its skull. Using his Astral Shell, Zariel cast *Speak with Dead*. The ancient spirit, its voice echoing from the shell, offered cryptic pronouncements. It had been a groundskeeper, slain by a "monstrous form. Mouth tentacles." Of its death, it knew little more, unable to comprehend their dating system. "What year is it?" it rasped, a question that stumped even the nomadic Wesley. When asked of valuables, it whispered, "All stones kept in the vault." And its dying wish? A surprisingly earthy desire: "Hold my kids and fuck my partner one more time." "All right," Zariel had replied with sincere gravity, "I'll see if I can do that for you." Its final words, before the connection faded, were that it "managed the grounds in the building."

The path forward led to a heavy stone door, devoid of handles or keyholes. Brute strength, even with Leopold’s newly forged pry bars and Kaladen’s leverage stone, proved futile, the ancient mechanism finally shattering under their efforts, sealing the door tight. "Well, I don't know if I have the elbow grease for this one, gents," Leopold sighed, after a particularly strenuous, and ultimately fruitless, heave. But where muscle failed, artifice prevailed. Unsheathing his plasma sword, Leopold activated its "Unstoppable" feature. The blade glowed with incandescent heat, melting through the ancient stone, carving a new doorway where none had been.

Beyond lay a plain, almost stark room, its only feature a central stone pedestal upon which rested five thin, exquisitely worked stone cups, each filled with a different colored liquid – green, yellow, red, purple, and blue – arranged in a pentagon. Sylvan runes on the pedestal declared: "All personnel must drink from the green cup." Leopold, ever impulsive, reached for a random cup. "Hey, slow down. Stop it, my friend," Kaladen interjected, his voice sharp. "Don't drink that. You don't know what it is." Zariel, after his Divination ritual yielded a pleasant omen regarding the green cup, took a tentative sip. Then Leopold, not to be outdone, drank the other half. Nothing. Zariel, perhaps still influenced by his guiding sense, then sampled the blue, then the yellow. It was Kaladen who pieced it together. "Yellow, blue, yellow, blue, make green," he murmured. "Mix the two together first, then you drink." They combined the contents of the blue and yellow cups, creating a vibrant green liquid. One by one, Kaladen and Leopold took their draught, Wesley presumably following suit. As the last of the concoction was consumed, a distinct sound echoed from somewhere deep within the ruins – the heavy, grinding thud of shifting stone.

A new path, perhaps, or a new peril? The ancient ruins, it seemed, were only just beginning to reveal their secrets, and our heroes, with their strange new rabbit-folk companion, stood ready to delve deeper into the heart of the unknown.

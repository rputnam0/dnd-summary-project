Observed by Zariel discussing another dome, missing persons, etc. Personally assigned Case 22391. Summoned the party back to HQ via Ratshit after their tunnel investigation. Conducted Zariel's post-mission briefing: Used silence and indirect questioning.

Briefed the party and Omen Knights on the Moonhaven expedition and the associated festival, outlining the party's "Watchdog" role. Granted Kaladin's request for party involvement in the fey woman's care. Oversaw the festival and ordered the Arcane Splitter's activation. During the subsequent werewolf and cultist attack, he was persuaded by Leopold to remain and manage the Splitter, sending his "Blackguard" Knight through instead. Abruptly departed the battle after receiving a comm from a calm female voice requesting his presence elsewhere.
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Returned to Legionnaire HQ. Attended urgent Hand of God cult briefing, allocating resources. Privately informed Kaladin of council scrutiny and suspected leak.
    *   **(Session 14 Update):** Appeared very tired. Tasked the recovering Ratshit with finding the missing O'Dears, promising Omen Knight promotion. Expressed concern about potential city exit. Later, debriefed Kaladen on their return, formally promoted Kaladen (and by extension Leopold & Zariel) and Ratshit to Omen Knight. Expressed frustration about the "lost" mask but offered hope, stating he would contact the "High Healer" about the petrified Fey Woman. Revealed deep suspicion of Lord of Advancement Calmera Windrider ("Kalmar, you snake"), noting Calmera's fixation on Leopold. Reiterated suspicion about a council leak and the "staged" nature of the werewolf attack, asking Kaladen to meet trusted individuals. *(Status: Active, at Legionnaire HQ, dealing with internal political issues and suspected leak, promoted the party, seeking aid for Fey Woman.)*
*   **Hamhawk:** Ogre-like female humanoid smithy for the Legionnaires. Gruff, efficient, protective of her advanced forge (Storm District). Underbite, sharp canines, glasses, blonde pigtail. Crafted party's custom gear. Provided Leopold schematics for "Project Splitter." Tasked Leopold with gathering materials. Upgraded Kaladin's weapon. Revealed Splitter's purpose (Moonhaven).

    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Upgraded party comms. Observed working on "plasma sword" schematic. Impressed by Leopold's suggestion, offered conditional apprenticeship.
    *   **(Session 14 Update):** Greeted the party. Showed Leopold the assembled plasma sword handle, awaiting a power source. Examined Leopold's recharged Blackguard Knight power core, noting its advanced, "necromantic-like" (life force) nature (party, not Leopold, saw "KW" initials etched on it). After tense negotiation facilitated by Kaladen, formally agreed to Leopold's apprenticeship. Agreed to craft dragon scale armor for Kaladen and standard Omen Knight gear for Ratshit (including a custom Ring of Frost cup holder). Provided intel on Calmera Windrider (from North Dome, "douche," advancer not inventor).
    *   **(Session 15 Update):** Confirmed Kaladen's dragon scale armor piece would be ready soon. Agreed to craft a Ring of Protection +1 for Zariel (1000g). DM noted price might have been better if party hadn't "burned bridge" over Leopold's power core.

*   **Selena Sal:** Eccentric, seemingly ancient potion shop owner (Storm District). Huge goggles, messy bun, patchwork muumuu. Potentially senile or feigning it. Has a talking hermit crab, Marcel.

*   **Mysterious Woman on Altar (Likely Faye Lara):** Young, fair-skinned woman with dirty brown hair. Her life-sustaining glass mask (filled with living plants, now named "Breath of the Feywild" by Kaladin) was stolen by Cedric (Session 10), causing her to turn to stone. The mask was recovered by Kaladin (Session 11) and, when donned by him (Session 12), induced a vision of a fey woman named Faye Lara (likely the woman herself) in the Feywild and caused Kaladin's physical transformation. Kaladin feels a connection to her/mask.
    *   **(Session 14 Update):** Lord Marshall Thurr stated he will contact the "High Healer" to see if her petrification can be reversed. *(Status: Petrified, mask attuned to Kaladin.

Core now powers Leopold's Plasma Sword (Session 15). *(Status: Deactivated. Body (missing one power core, which is with Leopold) and greatsword recovered by party. Likely defeated by werewolf. Linked to Calmera Windrider.)*

    *   **(Session 15 Update):** Encountered guarding the Omen Knight Fort.

    *   **Role & Objectives:** Member of the High Council, responsible for technological advancement. Summoned Leopold and Zariel to see Leopold, expressing keen, unsettling interest in "analyzing" Leopold's automaton nature and reacting strongly to his "Bone Crusher" emblem. Possesses an older model Blackguard Knight he referred to as "Victor too."
    *   **Key Interactions (Session 14):** Summoned Leopold and Zariel. Examined Leopold invasively, asserting Leopold was "just a suit of armor." His Blackguard Knight (referred to as "Victor too") blocked Leopold's attempt to leave. Dismissed them with displeasure. Revealed by Thurr to be fixated on Leopold's form and called a "snake."

## Important Events So Far

*   **Induction into the Stonewall Legionnaires:** Kaladin, Leopold, and Zariel attended Legionnaire tryouts, revealed potent 'Isoptic Curse' abilities, attracted high-level interest, collectively defeated a cursed Fire Elemental, and accepted offers to join the Legionnaires.
*   **Festival Attack and Rise of "The Hand of God":** During a public festival, a monstrous werewolf attacked Legionnaires outside the dome while extremist cultists, "The Hand of God," launched a coordinated assault from within. The party defended citizens and neutralized several cultists, revealing a dangerous new internal threat.
*   **Revelation and Defeat of 'The Reverend' & City-Wide Cult Uprising (Session 9 & 10):** Infiltrating the Hand of God's base, the party confronted High Cleric Father Kallor, revealed as "The Reverend," the cult's fanatical leader. Kallor transformed into a powerful angelic being. The party, with aid from an injured Sylvaris Sunseeker, defeated The Reverend. Simultaneously, the cult launched a massive, coordinated city-wide uprising, wiping out an Omen Knight task force and attacking Legionnaire Core.
*   **Theft of the Fey Woman's Mask and Her Petrification (Session 10):** While the party battled The Reverend, Cedric (Hand of God scouter) led an attack on the Legionnaire Med Bay. He stole the Mysterious Fey Woman's life-sustaining mask, causing her to instantly turn to stone. Cedric escaped.
*   **Pursuit of Cedric, Mask Recovery, and Emergence from the Dome (Session 11):** The party tracked the transformed Cedric into a subterranean cave system. After a fierce battle, during which a mysterious, powerful entity spoke to Kaladin through Cedric, they defeated Cedric and recovered the Fey Woman's mask. Following Cedric's cryptic clue about "water you can jump in," they navigated a subterranean river, emerging outside New New Arbor's Southern Dome.
*   **Revelations Outside the Dome: The Blackguard Knight's True Nature and Kaladin's Fey Awakening (Session 12):** While investigating the Arcane Splitter site, the party discovered the deactivated Blackguard Knight, revealed to be an advanced Warforged bearing Leopold's "Bone Crusher" emblem. Later, Kaladin donned the recovered Fey Woman's mask ("Breath of the Feywild"), experiencing a profound vision of Faye Lara and undergoing a persistent physical fey transformation.
*   **Discovery of a Mana Wellspring and Defeat of its Dragon Guardian (Session 13):** The party navigated subterranean caverns to discover a lava-filled cave network. They defeated a Young Red Dragon guarding a passage to a chamber housing a Mana Wellspring. Interaction with the Wellspring transformed Zariel's arm and granted power, while Kaladin and Leopold gained Stress Points. Leopold recharged a salvaged Blackguard Knight power core.
*   **Return to HQ, Omen Knight Promotions, and Ominous Revelations (Session 14):** The party (Kaladen, Leopold, Zariel) and their former handler Ratshit (Donnie Farsight) were all promoted to Omen Knight rank by Lord Marshall Thurr. Kaladen received a prophetic dream from the Mysterious Entity. Zariel experienced a memory-dream of his elven master. Leopold faced unsettling scrutiny from the Lord of Advancement Calmera Windrider, who showed intense interest in his "Bone Crusher" emblem and referred to his own Blackguard Knight as "Victor too." Initials "KW" (Calmera Windrider's) were found on Leopold's salvaged power core, linking Calmera to advanced Warforged technology. The party received new magic items and a new mission to hunt lycanthropes.
*   **Lycanthrope Infestation & Zariel's True Form (Session 15):** As new Omen Knights, the party investigated a lycanthrope outbreak in the Storm District. They defeated two werecreatures in a subterranean tunnel network, learning of "syringes" possibly used to spread the curse. Pursued by a horde, they battled a formidable Alpha Werewolf. During this fight, Zariel, near death, experienced a vision of his creator and transformed, shedding his outer shell to reveal a larger, metallic "True Form," healing him. The party managed a desperate escape after Kaladen used a stress point to collapse a walkway, sending the Alpha into a pit.
*   **Defeat of the Storm District Alpha Werewolf & Kaladen's Transformation (Session 16):** After further preparation, including researching werewolf anomalies and crafting more silver dust, the O'Dears returned to the lycanthrope den. They located and trapped the female Alpha Werewolf in her private chamber by collapsing the entrance. A long and brutal fight ensued, culminating in the Alpha's defeat by Kaladen. During the battle, Kaladen was bitten and infected with lycanthropy. Choosing a drastic measure, he self-amputated his infected left arm and consumed his Potion of Soulwood Prosthesis, causing a small green vine to sprout from the stump, beginning to form a new, magical limb. Two werewolf pups were found alive in the den after the Alpha's defeat.

## Ongoing Mysteries & Goals

*   What is the full nature, origin, and range of effects of the Isoptic Curse? (Note: Kaladin's fey transformation, entity dream, and now nascent Soulwood arm. Zariel's transformed arm, "True Form," and suspected latent lycanthropy. All PCs, including Ratshit, are Omen Knights. Stress Points gained by PCs.)
*   What are the details surrounding Zariel's memory loss and 'accident'? (Note: Warforged nature confirmed. Session 14: Memory-dream of elven master, arcane beam experiments, and a "godforsaken sphere." Session 15: Vision of elven creator and reveal of "True Form" with "Z" emblem. Session 16: Suspects latent lycanthropy from a previous bite.)
*   What happened during Leopold's past (deactivation, memory issues)? What is the story behind his "Bone Crusher" emblem? Was his brother truly an Omen Knight named Victor? (Note: Session 12: Blackguard Knight with identical emblem. Session 13: Memory flash of elven mentor & brother Victor. Session 14: Lord of Advancement Calmera Windrider's intense reaction to emblem, his "Victor too" comment about his own Blackguard, and "KW" initials on Leopold's salvaged power core, now powering his plasma sword.)

Session 16: Arm replaced by Soulwood prosthesis.)

*   What is the full power structure of the Stonewall Legionnaires and New New Arbor? (Note: Entity's task for Kaladin. Thurr suspects council leak and dislikes Calmera. New Omen Knight CO Leora Wagnar introduced.)

*   What is the nature and origin of the Myconids in the Fungal Tunnels? What is their goal?

Successfully stealthed (Perception Nat 20) to eavesdrop on the transformed Cedric and his cultist companion in a subterranean cavern, learning of Cedric's search for "water" and guidance from an unseen entity. Initiated combat with Lightning Lure. Used Light Splitter, Burning Hands (sculpted), and a critical Firebolt. During the fight, a mysterious, powerful entity cast Time Stop and spoke directly to him through Cedric, claiming a blood relationship ("my blood flows through your veins"), revealing it was "sealed" and now "out," and tasking him with investigating the Legionnaires and finding the entity later. After Cedric's defeat, retrieved the Fey Woman's mask, feeling a power surge. Suggested following Cedric's clue to find "water you can jump in." Used Firebolt to gauge the depth of a water shaft. Saved Zariel from being swept out of their boat in rapids with Lightning Lure. Emerged with the party outside the Southern Dome into a pleasant environment where their Legionnaire tech failed.

Experienced a profound vision of "Faye Lara" and millennia passing in the Feywild, resulting in a persistent physical transformation (more elven/fey appearance, longer ears, green hints in hair, taller, lithe). The mask became attuned to him without requiring a slot and he suggested it might be called "Breath of the Wild."
        *   Deep Cavern Exploration & Dragon Fight (Session 13): Recalled and shared vision details with party, formally naming the mask "Breath of the Feywild." Agreed on a cover story (Isoptic Curse manifestation) for his fey transformation. Used Lightning Lure to help navigate river. Wore mask and used its Interwoven Roots ability for party telepathy.

Simultaneously, Kaladin and Leopold observed a metallic glint in his shoulder wound.
        *   Climax Battle vs. The Reverend & Warforged Nature Confirmed (Session 10): Started session unconscious. Was healed by Ratchet. Used Faerie Fire on The Reverend, Legionnaire Minor Heal on self, Healing Word on Ratchet, and Ice Knife (hitting The Reverend). Was knocked unconscious by The Reverend, dropping Faerie Fire and experiencing a vision (man in silk robes, texts mentioning "far north," "to the tree"). Failed a second Death Save. Healed by Kaladin. Knocked unconscious again by The Reverend. While unconscious, was hit by a Divine Beam Lair Action, which burned away flesh revealing his metallic components (forearms, elbow joint) to Kaladin and Leopold. Made a successful Death Save. Healed by Leopold. Post-battle, used Faerie Fire to investigate faint footprints near The Reverend's remains, which then vanished. During a long rest, experienced another vision (copper city, voice asking "How do you know you're just a robot? Is she worth the cost?"). Confided in Kaladin and Leopold about his revealed metallic nature, his dreams, and his fear/need for research, receiving their support.

        *   Tracking Cedric & Escaping the Dome (Session 11): Leveled up to 5. Identified his Pocket Workshop lottery item. Led the party in tracking the transformed Cedric with exceptional Survival skills through tunnels into a natural cave system. Contributed to a botched group stealth attempt (Nat 1). In combat, cast Flame Blade (manifesting as fiery claws) and Wild Shaped into a (bipedal, bowler-hat-wearing) Bear, dealing significant fire damage but taking heavy damage and reverting. Continued fighting with Flame Blade and used a Legionnaire healing syringe. Landed the killing blow on Cedric with a visceral "ice cream scoop" attack. Offered his Pocket Workshop for Leopold to construct a boat. Wild Shaped into a Giant Spider to scout a deep water shaft, confirming it was survivable. Struggled to get into the boat in the rapids (multiple failed Strength saves) and was saved by Kaladin. Emerged with the party outside the Southern Dome, where his Legionnaire tech failed. Used Survival to estimate their location. Theorized that the "danger outside the dome" was staged by the authorities to keep people in.
        *   Operations Outside the Dome (Session 12): Fought a Giant Frog-like creature, Wild Shaping into his signature bowler-hatted Bear form and later casting Call Lightning (which was highly effective due to the creature's susceptibility) and Healing Word. Cast Healing Spirit during a short rest. Used Pass Without Trace to help the party approach the Arcane Splitter site. Voiced strong suspicions about Legionnaire deception regarding the outside world and contributed to planning a cover story. Opened his Pocket Workshop to store the deactivated Blackguard Knight and for the party to take a long rest, expressing ethical concerns about dismantling the potentially sentient Knight. Reflected on surviving a tough fight without going down.
        *   Deep Cavern Navigation & Mana Wellspring Interaction (Session 13): Agreed with cover story for Kaladin. Used Thorn Whip, ritual cast Water Walk, and Wild Shaped into a Giant Spider (described with six-pack abs and aviators) to help the party navigate the subterranean river upstream and ascend a vertical shaft. Scouted new caves as a spider. In combat against a Young Red Dragon, initiated the fight with a Nat 20 web attack that revealed the dragon as it caught fire.

Identified the PCs' 'Isoptic Curse' potential, recruited them. Directed the party to Hamhock. Casual but authoritative. Observed by Zariel discussing another dome, missing persons, etc. Personally assigned Case 22391. Summoned the party back to HQ via Ratshit after their tunnel investigation. Conducted Zariel's post-mission briefing: Used silence and indirect questioning. Discerned via Zariel's high Insight that Levi knew about the hidden woman but chose not to press when Zariel omitted her, seemingly satisfied and deciding a course based on this. Observed using a high-tech runic bracelet.
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Participated in the Hand of God cult briefing, questioning the party's actions regarding Xander. Led a strike team to provide reconnaissance and overwatch for the party's infiltration. Provided comms updates during the operation, reporting thousands of cultists emerging city-wide ("This is huge") and then that the Legionnaire Core itself was under attack. Dispatched his mage from chapel surveillance and stated he was heading back to the Core.
    *   **(Session 10 Update):** Communicated with Kaladin during the battle against The Reverend, confirming he was en route to the Med Bay. Later reported to the party via comms that the Fey Woman had been turned to stone after Cedric stole her mask during an attack on the Med Bay, and that Cedric had escaped through tunnels, possibly heading towards their location. He debriefed the party post-battle at HQ, gathered information about The Reverend's defeat, confirmed Sylvaris Sunseeker's retirement, and promoted Kaladin, Leopold, and Zariel to Omen Knight rank, providing armor upgrade vouchers. Tasked Ratchet with getting a sample of the liquid from the mausoleum. *(Status: Active at Legionnaire HQ, managing fallout from cult uprising and Med Bay attack, promoted the party).*
*   **Lord Marshall Thurr:** High-ranking Stonewall Legionnaire leader. 'Bear of a man', beard, scar, cob pipe. Observed tryouts. Confirmed Legionnaire interest in Isoptic Curse. Endorsed Levi's offer. Fought alongside party against Cursed Fire Elemental. Initiated the cursed soldier program. Conducted Kaladin's post-mission briefing regarding the fey woman and Lancex. Briefed the party and Omen Knights on the Moonhaven expedition and the associated festival, outlining the party's "Watchdog" role. Granted Kaladin's request (Persuasion Nat 20) for party involvement in the fey woman's care. Oversaw the festival and ordered the Arcane Splitter's activation. During the subsequent werewolf and cultist attack, he was persuaded by Leopold to remain and manage the Splitter, sending his "Blackguard" Knight through instead. Abruptly departed the battle after receiving a comm from a calm female voice requesting his presence elsewhere.
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Returned to Legionnaire HQ. Attended the urgent Hand of God cult briefing, allocating significant resources: Ratchet to lead the party's group, Levi to lead a strike team, and an Omen Knight task force. Privately informed Kaladin that he (Thurr) is under scrutiny by the council and suspects a leak within the government, tying up his personal involvement in the field. Captain Levi mentioned in Session 10 "Lord Marshall will be in touch when he can." *(Status: Active, at Legionnaire HQ, dealing with internal political issues and suspected leak, expected to contact party eventually)*
*   **Hamhawk:** Ogre-like female humanoid smithy for the Legionnaires. Gruff, efficient, protective of her advanced forge (Storm District). Underbite, sharp canines, glasses, blonde pigtail. Crafted party's custom gear. Provided Leopold schematics for "Project Splitter" (now "Arcane Splitter"). Tasked Leopold with gathering materials. Upgraded Kaladin's weapon. Revealed Splitter's purpose (Moonhaven). Received final component, confirmed completion. Continued rebuffing Leopold's apprenticeship attempts. Informed party Ratshit was looking for them. Upgraded Kaladin's and Zariel's armor to medium for cost of materials. Zariel perceived a blueprint on her lab table. Leopold's attempt to persuade her to contact him for jobs was met with noncommittal silence.
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Quickly upgraded the party's comms system with a quiet/loud toggle. Was observed by the party working on a schematic for a new "plasma sword" design. Impressed by Leopold's suggestion for an internal power source for the sword, she offered him a conditional apprenticeship if he could find a suitable energy source. *(Status: Active at her forge)*.
*   **Donnie Farsight (Ratshit):** Malnourished-looking half-orc handler for the party. Cynical, fast-talking. Explained barracks procedures, gear, pay/lottery. Delivered gear and first mission folder. Relayed Levi's summons. Facilitated return to HQ and briefings. Deceived by Leopold's prank. Explained reward options. Conveyed Thurr's instruction about Lancex's club. Provided "Watchdog" assignment, requested party name. After festival attack, debriefed party, praised Zariel. Lied to Leopold about civilian casualty (Zariel detected lie). Assigned mission: find "The Hand of God" cult leader (alive), suggesting starting in Dawn District/Spit and Swallow. Stated "nobody called [Thurr] off," contradicting party's intel. Received party's report on Cedric/chapel lead. Seen using arcane rune wrist guard projecting to a pad for input. Stated Dawn District is not his primary responsibility (Storm District is). Denied Kaladin's request for an armor voucher. Rudely dismissed Leopold's offer to help with paperwork ("You are my fucking subordinate. Get the fuck out of here.").
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Documented ("Meeting 435") the Hand of God cult briefing. Assigned by Thurr to lead and accompany the party's infiltration group. Provided them with extra gear (enchanted cuffs, arcane stun grenades, extra healing). Joined the party in the mausoleum infiltration. In the "mass suicide" chamber, detected "off" radiant energy coating residue in cups, expressing unease. Provided combat support with Bless, Guidance (to Leopold), Shatter, and Toll the Dead. Argued with Leopold mid-combat about the metaphysics of healing Zariel's bear form. Took 20 damage from an Undead Soldier.
    *   **(Session 10 Update):** Fought alongside the party against The Reverend, providing crucial healing (Healing Word on Zariel) and re-establishing Bless. Took significant damage, was knocked unconscious by The Reverend, healed by Zariel, then knocked unconscious again by an Undead Soldier. Failed one death save, then made a successful one (Nat 19). Was stabilized by Leopold's Medicine check and evacuated from The Reverend's chapel by Sylvaris Sunseeker. Recovered enough by the next morning to be present at the debriefing with Captain Levi (arm in a sling), taking notes. Informed the party there was no cash reward for the mission, citing their promotion and tavern winnings as compensation. Facilitated their use of the Legionnaire lottery machine. *(Status: Active, recovering from injuries at Legionnaire HQ, continues role as party handler).*
*   **Selena Sal:** Eccentric, seemingly ancient potion shop owner (Storm District). Huge goggles, messy bun, patchwork muumuu. Potentially senile or feigning it. Has a talking hermit crab, Marcel. Her shop contains the hidden entrance to the Fungal Tunnels. Her involvement/awareness remains unknown. *(Not encountered Session 2-13)*.
*   **Lancex the Fungal Guardian:** Former Stonewall Legionnaire assimilated and mutated into a powerful Myconid Sovereign variant. His club's magic was transferred to Kaladin's weapon. *(Status: Deceased/Destroyed)*
*   **Mysterious Woman on Altar (Likely Faye Lara):** Young, fair-skinned woman with dirty brown hair. Her life-sustaining glass mask (filled with living plants, now named "Breath of the Feywild" by Kaladin) was stolen by Cedric (Session 10), causing her to turn to stone. The mask was recovered by Kaladin (Session 11) and, when donned by him (Session 12), induced a vision of a fey woman named Faye Lara (likely the woman herself) in the Feywild and caused Kaladin's physical transformation. Kaladin feels a connection to her/mask. Zariel found facility familiar, felt faint connection to her. Thurr noted unique magic.
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Unconscious in Legionnaire Med Bay, threatened by intruders.
    *   **(Session 10 Update):** Mask stolen by Cedric, causing petrification.
    *   **(Session 11 Update):** Mask recovered by Kaladin.
    *   **(Session 12 Update):** Revealed to likely be Faye Lara through Kaladin's vision.
    *   **(Session 13 Update):** Kaladin formally named the mask "Breath of the Feywild" and used its Interwoven Roots ability. *(Status: Petrified, mask attuned to Kaladin. Location remains Legionnaire Med Bay. Identity strongly suggested as Faye Lara.)*
*   **Blackguard Knight (Deactivated Warforged):** Extremely imposing figure in sleek, all-black armor with jagged pauldrons and an enormous greatsword. Formerly deployed by Thurr. Leopold felt "click" of recognition.
    *   **(Session 12 Update):** Found deactivated and damaged at the Arcane Splitter site (Market District exterior) by the party. Revealed to be a highly advanced Warforged, with no face behind its mask, only a blank slate inscribed with an iron gauntlet crushing a skull and the words "Bone Crusher" (identical to Leopold's emblem). Its internal mechanisms were more advanced than Leopold's. Its body and greatsword were salvaged by the party and stored in Zariel's Pocket Workshop for study. Leopold's attempt to remove a power core resulted in an electrical shock due to a tamper-proof mechanism.
    *   **(Session 13 Update):** Leopold successfully extracted one of its power cores (triggering a memory flash for him) and recharged it using the Mana Wellspring. *(Status: Deactivated. Body (missing one power core) and greatsword recovered by party. Likely defeated by the werewolf creature.)*
*   **Unnamed Posh Nobleman:** Arrogant participant in Legionnaire tryouts; Kaladin's opponent. Revealed he was cursed, transformed into a Fire Elemental. *(Status: Deceased/Destroyed as Fire Elemental)*
*   **Philindra Sprawlweaver:** Owner of the "Mystical Scripts Scroll" shop in the Market District. Professional, friendly woman. *(Not encountered Session 5-13)*.

    *   **Transformed "Emperor of Monstrosity" (Session 11):** Tracked by the party. His form had further mutated. Served as a conduit for a Mysterious Entity.
    *   **(Session 11 Update):** Defeated by the party. Upon removal of the Fey Woman's mask from his remains, his body instantly turned to stone, cracked, and began to crumble. *(Status: Deceased. Fey Woman's mask recovered by Kaladin.)*
*   **High Cleric Father Kallor / The Reverend:** Formerly High Cleric of the Court of Viteo. Revealed as "The Reverend," leader of the "Hand of God" cult.
    *   **(Session 10 Update):** Defeated by Leopold. His body ("gold metallic dust of skin," "gold blood") lies in his chapel. His greatsword transformed into the Light Splitter. *(Status: Deceased. Weapon recovered by Kaladin.)*
*   **Xander (Cultist Groundskeeper):** Publicly a groundskeeper, secretly a Hand of God cultist. Charmed by Leopold, gave key. Abducted, interrogated. *(Status: Captured by party, held in Legionnaire HQ, mentally unstable.)*
*   **Sylvaris Sunseeker (Omen Knight Leader):** Tall, elven-heritage man.
    *   **(Session 10 Update):** Task force ambushed and killed. Burst into The Reverend's chapel mid-battle, heavily injured. Assisted party. Evacuated Ratchet. Later retired from Omen Knights. *(Status: Alive, heavily injured, retired.)*
*   **Mysterious Entity (Name Unknown):** A powerful, unnamed entity.
    *   **(Session 11 Revelation):** Manifested through transformed Cedric. Spoke to Kaladin, claimed blood relationship ("my blood flows through your veins"), stated it was "sealed" and now "out." Tasked Kaladin with analyzing Legionnaires and finding it later.
    *   **(Session 13 Update):** Kaladin sensed a dark presence watching him at the Mana Wellspring, which faded when noticed; possibly connected to this entity. *(Status: Active, at large, nature and full motives unknown.)*
*   **Faye Lara:** A fey woman encountered by Kaladin in a profound vision (Session 12) when he donned her mask (now "Breath of the Feywild").
    *   **Appearance (in vision):** Fair, long hair with flowers, no mask, pointed features, very fey. Voice has a "nice southern drawl."
    *   **Interaction:** Spoke to Kaladin ("Cal"), acknowledging his importance, hinting at a forgotten shared past, and a future role ("world's going to be a big mess"). Stated she was "dead in a traditional sense" but could be contacted via the mask. Indicated they were in the Feywild in the vision.
    *   **Significance:** Almost certainly the "Mysterious Woman on Altar" who is currently petrified. Her interaction with Kaladin caused his physical fey transformation. Kaladin formally named the mask "Breath of the Feywild" in Session 13. A key figure in Kaladin's personal arc and the Feywild mystery. *(Status: "Dead in a traditional sense" but communicable via the mask; physical body petrified in Legionnaire Med Bay. Connection to Kaladin established.)*
*   **Young Red Dragon:** A large red serpent with crimson scales gleaming like molten metal, golden eyes, and ivory fangs. Described as "young" (a couple hundred years old).
    *   **Role:** Acted as a guardian of a passage leading to a Mana Wellspring in a deep cavern network beneath New New Arbor. Its "horde" was the magical source itself.
    *   **Interactions:** Fought the party fiercely in its lava-filled lair, using fire breath and physical attacks. Was revealed when Zariel's web caught fire on it. Was critically affected by Leopold's Snare trap and Hideous Laughter spell.
    *   **Significance:** A major combat encounter that nearly defeated the party. Its presence suggests powerful entities are aware of and protect Mana Wellsprings. Its defeat allowed the party to access the Wellspring chamber. Dragon parts (backbone, claws) were harvested by Kaladin and Leopold.
    *   *(Status: Deceased. Killed by Kaladin in Session 13.)*

## Important Events So Far

*   **Induction into the Stonewall Legionnaires:** Kaladin, Leopold, and Zariel attended Legionnaire tryouts, revealed potent 'Isoptic Curse' abilities, attracted high-level interest, collectively defeated a cursed Fire Elemental, and accepted offers to join the Legionnaires.
*   **Festival Attack and Rise of "The Hand of God":** During a public festival, a monstrous werewolf attacked Legionnaires outside the dome while extremist cultists, "The Hand of God," launched a coordinated assault from within. The party defended citizens and neutralized several cultists, revealing a dangerous new internal threat.
*   **Revelation and Defeat of 'The Reverend' & City-Wide Cult Uprising (Session 9 & 10):** Infiltrating the Hand of God's base, the party confronted High Cleric Father Kallor, revealed as "The Reverend," the cult's fanatical leader. Kallor transformed into a powerful angelic being. The party, with aid from an injured Sylvaris Sunseeker, defeated The Reverend. Simultaneously, the cult launched a massive, coordinated city-wide uprising, wiping out an Omen Knight task force and attacking Legionnaire Core.
*   **Theft of the Fey Woman's Mask and Her Petrification (Session 10):** While the party battled The Reverend, Cedric (Hand of God scouter) led an attack on the Legionnaire Med Bay. He stole the Mysterious Fey Woman's life-sustaining mask, causing her to instantly turn to stone. Cedric escaped.
*   **Pursuit of Cedric, Mask Recovery, and Emergence from the Dome (Session 11):** The party tracked the transformed Cedric into a subterranean cave system. After a fierce battle, during which a mysterious, powerful entity spoke to Kaladin through Cedric (claiming a blood tie and tasking him with investigating the Legionnaires), they defeated Cedric and recovered the Fey Woman's mask. Following Cedric's cryptic clue about "water you can jump in," they navigated a subterranean river, emerging outside New New Arbor's Southern Dome into a surprisingly pleasant, natural environment where their Legionnaire technology ceased to function.
*   **Revelations Outside the Dome: The Blackguard Knight's True Nature and Kaladin's Fey Awakening (Session 12):** While investigating the Arcane Splitter site outside the Southern Dome, the party discovered the deactivated Blackguard Knight, revealed to be an advanced Warforged bearing Leopold's "Bone Crusher" emblem. Its body was salvaged. Later, Kaladin donned the recovered Fey Woman's mask ("Breath of the Feywild"), experiencing a profound vision of a fey entity named Faye Lara, undergoing a persistent physical fey transformation, and forming an attunement to the mask.
*   **Discovery of a Mana Wellspring and Defeat of its Dragon Guardian (Session 13):** After navigating treacherous subterranean caverns upstream from their previous exit point, the party discovered a new network of humid, lava-filled caves. They found a cryptic Sylvan message ("Three for a wedding") and signs of a large burrowing creature. Their exploration led to a fierce battle against a Young Red Dragon guarding a passage. After defeating the dragon, they discovered a chamber deep beneath New New Arbor housing a section of a Mana Wellspring, a pure font of arcane energy identical to that powering the Core and the Dome. Zariel was compelled to interact with it, undergoing a significant physical transformation to his arm and gaining new power (and a Stress Point). Kaladin willingly touched it, gaining a Stress Point and sensing a dark presence watching him. Leopold successfully extracted and then recharged a salvaged Blackguard Knight power core using the Wellspring, also gaining a Stress Point.

*   **Subterranean Natural Cave System (Beyond The Reverend's Chapel):** An extensive network of natural caves with mineral deposits, stalagmites, and dripping water, connected to the tunnels beneath the Court of Viteo. Cedric made a temporary camp here before being confronted by the party in Session 11. This system leads to a deep vertical shaft containing a subterranean river. *Revisited by the party in Session 13, who navigated upstream from the river and shaft to explore a new connecting cavern network.*
*   **Vertical Water Shaft & Subterranean River System:** A deep, dark vertical shaft accessible from the natural cave system. Leads to a fast-moving subterranean river flowing through cylindrical tunnels, sometimes at steep angles, with rapids and turbulent water. Navigated by the party via a constructed boat in Session 11, ultimately leading them outside New New Arbor's Southern Dome. *Party traversed this system upstream in Session 13 using Water Walk and Zariel's spider form to access a new cavern network from the top of the shaft.*

Contains the Sylvan Message Wall and the Young Red Dragon's Lair. Leads to the Mana Wellspring Chamber.
*   **Sylvan Message Wall (New Humid Cavern Network, Session 13):** A specific cave wall within the new humid cavern network. Features a recently inscribed crude picture of three corvid-type birds alongside text in Sylvan reading "Three for a wedding." Divination magic was sensed localized here by Leopold.

## Ongoing Mysteries & Goals

*   What is the full nature, origin, and range of effects of the Isoptic Curse? (Note: Cedric's advanced vine-like transformation observed. Entity used Cedric as conduit. The Reverend's angelic form. Kaladin's fey transformation via mask. Cost/drawbacks still largely unknown. Session 13: Party decided to use Isoptic Curse manifestation as Kaladin's cover story for fey transformation. Kaladin, Leopold, Zariel gained Stress Points from Mana Wellspring interaction; Zariel's arm permanently transformed.)
*   What are the details surrounding Zariel's memory loss and 'accident'? (Note: Warforged nature confirmed. His theory about Legionnaire deception regarding the outside world is strengthening. His growing skepticism of authority figures continues. Session 13: Interaction with Mana Wellspring caused further physical transformation, visibly revealing metallic musculature and granting new power, reinforcing his unique connection to arcane energies.)
*   What happened during Leopold's past (deactivation, memory issues)? What is the story behind his "Bone Crusher" emblem? Was his brother truly an Omen Knight named Victor? (Note: Omen Knight Laser (deceased) saw "Bone Crusher" emblem on "higher up." Session 12: Discovery of the deactivated Blackguard Knight, an advanced Warforged bearing an identical "Bone Crusher" emblem, provides a major new lead. Seeing Kaladin's fey transformation triggered a memory flash for Leopold of an elven mentor and his brother Victor. Session 13: Extracting the Blackguard Knight's power core triggered a memory flash of an elven mentor and his brother Victor making a violent comment, providing more names and context to his past.)
*   What were Kaladin's specific dreams motivating him? What is the nature of his connection to the Feywild/past lives? (Note: Mysterious Entity (Session 11) claimed a blood relation. Session 12: Donning the Fey Woman's mask ("Breath of the Feywild") induced a vision of Faye Lara in the Feywild, a persistent physical fey transformation, and confirmed a forgotten connection ("Cal"). This significantly deepens his fey heritage mystery. Session 13: Kaladin formally named Faye Lara's mask 'Breath of the Feywild.' When touching the Mana Wellspring, he sensed a dark presence watching him, which faded when noticed, potentially linked to the entity from Session 11 or his fey heritage.)
*   What are the potential consequences or drawbacks of using Stress Points? (Note: Zariel collapsed after using two in Session 6. Session 13: Kaladin used one to ensure an attack hit. Kaladin, Leopold, and Zariel all gained Stress Points from Mana Wellspring interaction. Zariel is now at 5 used, Kaladin at 4, Leopold at 2. Zariel's arm transformation occurred alongside gaining a stress point.)
*   Who was the figure Kaladin saw watching him before the tryouts? (Note: The Mysterious Entity has been "watching" him. Faye Lara also implied watching/waiting. Session 13: Kaladin sensed a dark presence at the Mana Wellspring.)
*   What is the significance of Zariel's red-tipped orchid?
*   How common is the Isoptic Curse? How is it perceived?
*   What is the full power structure of the Stonewall Legionnaires and New New Arbor? (Note: Entity's task for Kaladin to investigate Legionnaires. Thurr suspects council leak. Party increasingly mistrustful.)
*   What is the significance of Captain Levi's meeting regarding another domed city?
*   What is the nature and origin of the Myconids in the Fungal Tunnels? What is their goal?
*   Where are the missing people from the Storm District? (Note: "Hand of God" cult/uprising major factor. Boot found in frog (Session 12) hints at other fates outside dome.)
*   Is Selena Sal involved with, complicit in, or ignorant of the Myconid/Fey activity beneath her shop?
*   What is the significance of the small film reel Leopold received?
*   What will happen on Leopold's arranged "date" with Marcel the Hermit Crab?
*   Who/what is the mysterious woman found on the altar? What is the purpose/nature of her plant-filled mask and connection to Fey magic? (Note: The woman is very likely Faye Lara, encountered by Kaladin in a vision (Session 12) when he wore her mask. The mask, now named "Breath of the Feywild" by Kaladin (Session 13), caused Kaladin's transformation and is attuned to him. She remains petrified. Restoration is critical goal.)
*   Who is the "he" that Lancex warned is "coming for her" (Faye Lara)? (Note: The Mysterious Entity that spoke to Kaladin in Session 11 is the prime candidate. It was "sealed," is now "out," and claimed relation to Kaladin.)
*   What is the full extent and origin of the Fey magic presence in the Fungal Tunnels? (Note: Kaladin's direct Feywild vision and transformation via mask is significant.)
*   What are the Omen Knights' specific roles, powers, and allegiances? (Note: Party are Omen Knights, now operating outside dome without Legionnaire tech. Blackguard Knight was an advanced Warforged.)
*   What was the significance of the Albatross blood drawing ("one for sorrow") found in the tunnels? (Note: Sylvan message "Three for a wedding" with corvid images found in Session 13, suggesting a connection.)
*   What is the creature from Kaladin's dream? (Note: Entity connection. Faye Lara connection. Session 13: Sensed a 'darkness' watching him at the Mana Wellspring, possibly related.)
*   What truly happened to Moonhaven to cause its silence?
*   What are the full capabilities and implications of Project Splitter (Arcane Splitter)? (Note: Party investigated opening in Session 12.)
*   Who is the calm female voice that commanded Lord Marshall Thurr via comms?
*   What is the full extent, leadership, and ultimate goal of "The Hand of God" cult? (Note: Leader (Reverend) and key agent (Cedric) defeated. City-wide uprising continues. Entity guided Cedric.)

*   What is the significance of the recurring "metallic sheen" observed on Zariel? (Note: Warforged nature confirmed. Session 13: Right arm now permanently visibly metallic with coursing purple energy.)
*   What was Cedric's exact role within the Hand of God cult? What was the nature and source of his significant magical abilities? What were his motives? (Note: Acted as a conduit for the Mysterious Entity, seeking power. Isoptric Curse amplified by mask/entity. Now deceased.)
*   What is the origin and purpose of the mysterious yellow lubricant Zariel found on his knuckle?
*   Is the library scribe Victor Holloway connected in any way to Leopold's brother Victor? (Note: Leopold had memory flash of brother Victor and elven mentor in Session 12, and another in Session 13 confirming Victor's name and violent nature.)
*   What is the identity and true nature/power of "The Reverend," leader of the Hand of God cult? (Resolved in Session 9)
*   How did "The Reverend" feed and control hundreds of cultists in the hidden tunnels?
*   What is the significance of the "purification" and "desecration" Xander mentioned?
*   What will be the cult's response to Xander's capture and disappearance?
*   What is the true nature of Viteo's "wrath" aspect that the Hand of God cult seems to embody?
*   Is Father Kallor truly unaware of the massive cult operation beneath his chapel, or is he complicit/involved? (Resolved in Session 9)
*   What is the full nature and origin of "Teo, God of Wrath," the entity The Reverend claims to serve?
*   What is the true extent of the council leak Lord Marshall Thurr suspects? Who is involved? (Note: Entity's directive for Kaladin to investigate Legionnaires relates.)

*   What further details will Zariel uncover about his experimental past and Warforged nature? (Session 13: Mana Wellspring interaction led to significant physical transformation and new power.)
*   Who is the "higher up" individual Omen Knight Laser saw bearing the "Bone Crusher" emblem? (Note: Laser is deceased. Blackguard Knight now provides a direct link. Leopold's memory flash in Session 13 about brother Victor and elven mentor offers new leads.)
*   How can the Fey Woman (Faye Lara) be restored from her petrified state? What is needed to counteract it? (Note: Mask ("Breath of the Feywild") recovered and attuned by Kaladin; Faye Lara communicated with him via it. Method for physical restoration unknown.)

*   What power was the Mysterious Entity promising Cedric, and what did it mean by "once we get out"?
*   Why is the environment outside the Southern Dome pleasant and natural, contradicting previous depictions of the immediate exterior of New New Arbor? Was official information about the outside world deliberately misleading? (Note: Party continues to experience this pleasant exterior in Session 12, theory of deliberate misinformation strengthened by Zariel.)
*   Why did the party's Legionnaire technology (comms, armor abilities, maps) deactivate outside the dome? Is it reliant on dome infrastructure or magic?
*   What is the significance of the giant frog and giant beetles encountered outside the dome? Are they typical fauna of this region? (Note: Boot found in frog suggests interaction with dome dwellers.)

*   **Goal: Determine how to safely return to New New Arbor from outside the Southern Dome.** (In Progress - Party planning a cover story (Session 13), intend to backtrack through river/caverns. Arcane Splitter site not a viable re-entry.)
*   **Goal: Investigate the area around the Arcane Splitter dome opening in the Market District, possibly to find a re-entry point or learn more about the werewolf attack/external conditions.** (Partially Resolved in Session 12 - Investigated; found deactivated Blackguard Knight. Werewolf seems to have defeated it or moved on. Re-entry not possible here.)
*   **Goal: Understand the full properties and uses of Kaladin's Potion of Soulwood Prosthesis and Leopold's Porcelain Doll (prevents one death).**
*   **Goal: Learn to operate effectively outside the dome without Legionnaire technology.** (In Progress - Successfully defeated Giant Frog-like creature. Navigated extensive caverns and defeated a Young Red Dragon in Session 13. Using Pocket Workshop for shelter/rest.)
*   **Goal: Investigate the origin and meaning of the "Bone Crusher" emblem and its connection to Leopold and the advanced Warforged (Blackguard Knight).** (In Progress - Session 13: Leopold's memory flash from core extraction provided names Victor and elven mentor. Core successfully extracted and recharged.)
*   **Goal: Uncover the full history of Faye Lara and her connection to Kaladin, and address her cryptic warnings.** (In Progress - Session 13: Kaladin named mask "Breath of the Feywild.")
*   **Goal: Find a way to safely study or utilize the salvaged Blackguard Knight (body and greatsword) and its advanced technology.** (In Progress - Session 13: Leopold extracted and recharged one power core.)
*   **Goal: Determine how to help Faye Lara/the petrified woman further, beyond just restoring her physical form.**
*   **Goal: Survive the impending encounter indicated by the Nat 1 roll at the end of Session 12.** (Resolved in Session 13 - No immediate ambush from the roll itself; subsequent exploration led to the Young Red Dragon encounter.)
*   **Goal: Investigate the Sylvan messages ("One for sorrow," "Three for a wedding") and identify their source/meaning.** *(New)*
*   **Goal: Understand the nature and implications of the Mana Wellsprings and the party's interaction with them.** *(New)*
*   **Goal: Learn more about Leopold's past, specifically his brother Victor and the elven mentor from his memory flash.** *(New)*
*   **Goal: Determine what to do with the harvested dragon parts (backbone, claws).** *(New)*

The price of knowing oneself is often paid in blood and bone, a truth Cletus Cobbington was about to learn in the deepest, most unsettling sense. Within the reality-warping confines of the Baba Yaga’s hut, seated upon a rug painted with faded blood runes, the humble almond farmer faced the primordial hag. Thick, yellow smoke coiled from her pipe as she fixed him with an ancient, knowing gaze.

“What do you want to give me for more?” she rasped.

Cletus, seeking the truth of his bovine curse, offered his left hand—the very hand he used to cultivate the land. The hag’s price was steeper. “I take your left hand,” she confirmed, her own arm stretching unnaturally across the room to seal the deal. “And I take the rights to the almond farm.”

With a sickening pull, Cletus’s hand was gone, instantly woven into the hag’s grotesque necklace alongside a shrunken warforged form and a single wooden finger. In exchange, the truth was laid bare. “Beast Lord,” the Baba Yaga revealed, a title from a forgotten life in the western Feywild. As a parting gift for the gruesome trade, she bestowed upon him a sliver of his former might: the power to dominate the will of any monster, once per day.

With their bargains struck and their destinies clarified, the O’Dears stepped from the hag’s domain into the Cindered Cradle, a fiery arena at the base of the smoldering Tree of Death. Before them rose their final obstacle: the Cindered Guardian, a gargantuan monstrosity of fungus-riddled wood and burning embers, its very presence searing the air.

The battle began with a wave of futility. Kaladen’s arcane blasts of force magic dissipated harmlessly against the creature’s hide. Leopold, polymorphed into the hulking form of a Tyrannosaurus Rex, found his mighty bites and tail swipes failing to register, a strange, resilient magic nullifying any blow that lacked overwhelming power. The Guardian was a fortress, and the party’s initial salvos were but pebbles against its walls.

Then, something shifted. Kaladen, seeing his magic fail, let his fey nature surge. His ears lengthened, his form grew taller, and with a warrior’s cry, he abandoned his spells for the cold, hard certainty of his Light Splitter. He became a whirlwind of steel, his hasted form a blur of motion. With a guttural roar, his blade struck true, a critical blow that shattered the Guardian’s defenses with more than thirty points of damage. The threshold was broken. Zariel, a swirling elemental of pure water, followed suit, his own crushing slams landing with the force of a tidal wave.

The wounded Guardian retaliated with unbound fury. Its fiery halberd swept through the party, and necrotic roots burst from the ashen ground, restraining Cletus and Kaladen. The elf wizard, pinned and helpless, took the full brunt of the creature’s assault. Two devastating slashes sent him into the blackness of unconsciousness, a special malevolence in the attack ensuring he began his journey to death with one foot already in the grave.

The fight hung on a knife’s edge. Just as Kaladen’s life force began to fade, Zariel made a selfless choice. He dropped his powerful elemental form, becoming a vulnerable Half-Orc once more, and channeled all his remaining power into a single, desperate prayer. A torrent of healing energy washed over Kaladen, pulling him back from the brink. Seizing the opening, Leopold unleashed a final, desperate gambit. He channeled divine power into his saber, and with a shout, plunged the blade deep into the Guardian’s chest—a critical strike that blazed with holy, radiant light.

The creature staggered, its core exposed. This was the moment. Cyrus, the unassuming bard-turned-hero, saw his chance. Leaping from a companion’s shoulder, he drove his own blade down into the Guardian’s crown. There was no immediate explosion, only a profound silence as a web of brilliant light spread from the wound. Sunlight seemed to pour from within the husk, growing in intensity until, with a deafening crack, the Cindered Guardian split in two and erupted in a wave of fire and splinters.

Victory, however, was but a prelude to a stranger fate. A mystical pull emanated from the now-open portal in the Tree of Death. One by one, the heroes were drawn toward it. Kaladen went first, not walking, but pulled into the cradle, where he was instantly encased in a golden, amber cocoon and vanished. Zariel, thinking to dive in after him, met the same fate. Then Cyrus, then Cletus. Before Leopold was taken, a vision seized him: the spectral form of Bone Crusher stood before him, and from the dust of the slain Guardian, a new shadow monster rose at his command—a fleeting glimpse of a dark, necromantic power he was only beginning to understand. Then he, too, was pulled into the light, cocooned, and spirited away.

The world shifted. In a dark, magical grove in the Feywild, a mismatched group of guardians huddled around a purple fire. There was Alabaster, a pompous, three-trunked Loxodon paladin in gleaming platinum plate; Barrow, a brutish, rage-filled pig-man barbarian; Karak, an aloof eagle-man ranger; Tortimus Staggerfin, a perpetually tipsy tortle monk; and Gooch the Third, a tiny, cowardly halfling rogue who looked suspiciously like a house-elf. They had been gathered by Fae Lara—the very same woman from Kaladen’s visions, now a battle-hardened warrior with a half-shaven head and scars on her face. As the howls of an approaching enemy echoed from above, the tree behind them began to glow. Five amber eggs, each containing the helpless form of one of the O’Dears, emerged from its bark.

“This is him,” Fae Lara commanded, her voice cutting through the chaos. “In seven days flat, you need to be at the Tree of Life. I will meet you there. Try to clear the path best I can.” With that, she charged off to meet the enemy, leaving the newly dubbed “Guardians of the Wild” with their precious, unconscious cargo.

Their journey began with a sprint, leading them to the bizarre settlement of Reef Town. Here, an absurd conflict raged: jellyfish and octopoid Cephalorns, forced to live on land in magical water-filled helmets, were at war with the Kinku, bird-folk who had stolen their underwater city, the Marina, and now lived there in clumsy scuba suits. To pass through the gate that blocked their path, the Guardians had to render a service.

Their attempt at brokering a peace treaty was a farce. Gooch, with his uncanny stealth, overheard both the Grand Bubbler of the fish-folk and the Kenku Colonel plotting to betray them. "I heard him say he was going to kill me," the little rogue whispered, and diplomacy was swiftly abandoned for a more direct approach.

The resolution was as brutal as it was efficient. While Alabaster, Barrow, and Tortimus confronted the Kenku leader, Gooch snuck behind the Cephalorn’s remaining guard. With the vicious precision of a cornered sewer rat, he stabbed the guard in the knee. Then again. And a third time, until the leg simply fell off and the creature dissolved into a burst of seafoam. On the other side of town, the remaining Guardians faced the Kenku Colonel. Alabaster, spouting cheesy one-liners—“An elephant never forgets a debt or a slight!”—hacked off the leader’s wings. The birdman died lamenting the children he’d never have. Barrow, the pig-man, was unmoved. “I will not learn from this,” he grunted, wiping his blade clean.

Their service, in its own violent way, was rendered. The gate opened. But as the Guardians passed through, they heard the howls of pursuit. The pig bandits Fae Lara had warned them about were on their trail. With no time for rest, this strange new band of heroes fled into the wilds of the Feywild, the fate of the world’s greatest champions resting, quite literally, on their backs. The clock was ticking.

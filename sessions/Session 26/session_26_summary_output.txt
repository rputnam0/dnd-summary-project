The Chiari Rung Forest, a place whose name whispered of blood and shadow, did not suffer fools, nor did it reward haste. For the heroes known as the O’dears, the path north to the shattered dome of Moonhaven was not merely a journey, but a trial. Each step forward seemed to cost them two, and the forest itself felt like a thinking, breathing antagonist, conspiring to turn them back at every opportunity.

Their days began with a peculiar blend of ingenuity and absurdity. Leopold, ever the master craftsman, fashioned a miraculous device for Zariel’s werewolf pups—a timed, automated feeder that dispensed their gory meals with the scent of steak and a recorded message. “Here, here puppies, come get your food,” Zariel’s voice would chirp from the machine, “it’s Papa.” Meanwhile, Cletus renewed his mystical bond with Cyrus, not with a solemn vow, but with a soggy, roasted almond fished from the mouth of his squirrel, Chip. “Why is it wet?” Cyrus grimaced, slowly chewing the limp nut as if it were a punishment. “That’s why it’s warm too, huh?”

But the forest cared little for their camaraderie. Their first attempt at navigation, led by Zariel, ended in dismal failure. A critically misplaced step, a wrong turn at a gnarled root, and hours later they found themselves staring at their own tracks, having walked in a perfect, soul-crushing circle. An entire day, lost. They pressed on, their boots making sucking sounds in the boggy earth, and stumbled upon a pair of ancient, sphinx-like statues half-sunk in the mud. Investigation revealed little, save for a 45-year-old squirrel who claimed ownership of the monuments. “That right there is my piss rock,” the ancient rodent declared, taking a drag from a tiny cigarette, “and that one over there is my shit rock.” Convinced the statues were of no consequence, the party moved on, just as the forest intended.

A break in the canopy offered a glimpse of their destination—far to the north, so distant it was a mere silhouette against the horizon, an impossibly large tree towered over the mountains. Cyrus, his mind alight with the forbidden stories of his youth, knew it at once: the Tree of Death. As the others stared in awe, only Zariel’s sensitive automaton senses caught the tremor from the south. He turned just in time to see the peak of Drake’s Roost volcano shudder, smoke pluming from its summit before it spat a single, unknown object into the sky, a secret launched into the clouds before disappearing. The atmospheric disruption was immediate. A torrential rain swept over them, a deluge so fierce it stole another day, forcing them to huddle in their camp, the forest once more the victor.

That night, their fortunes swung on the whims of fate. Leopold, hunched over his Steel Defender with the focus of a master jeweler, successfully integrated a rare phoenix feather into its core, a Natural 20 on his check granting the construct a shimmering, innate resistance to fire. Steps away, Kaladen’s own arcane project met a far darker end. Meditating over his enchanted ring, a critical misstep in the magical weave sent a backlash of energy searing through him. His attempt was ruined, and with a gasp, his vision plunged into blackness. “Okay, guys,” he announced with feigned nonchalance, his eyes wide and unseeing, “I’m going to go to bed.”

The next day’s travel, guided by Leopold’s admittedly poor sense of direction, led them from bad to worse. The constant drone of insects and chirping of birds fell away into a deafening, unnatural silence. They had found another clearing, this one dominated by a murky, steaming bog that smelled of rot and acid. Zariel, his perception honed to a razor’s edge, scanned the water. He saw what looked like jagged rocks, a spine of black stone breaking the surface. Then, the stones shifted.

With a surge of foul water, the Adult Black Dragon erupted from its lair. Iridescent scales dripped with black ooze as it unfolded enormous wings, its roar tearing through the silence. Initiative was a blur of motion and magic. Cyrus unleashed a howling *Wind Wall* that slammed a log into the beast’s chest. Cletus summoned his four satyr companions—the “Rizzlers”—who, with impossible luck, peppered the dragon’s hide with a flurry of arrows, two finding their mark with supernatural precision.

The dragon, enraged, unleashed its full fury. A wave of frightful presence washed over them, but it was the torrent of acid that followed that nearly broke them. The jet of corrosive liquid melted through Cletus, leaving him clinging to life, and dissolved two of his satyrs into smoking sludge. Seeing his friend falter, Zariel made a choice. He called upon the power of his new Embered Mane, and with a surge of heat, his form dissolved, reforming into a swirling, sentient Fire Elemental. In the same moment, he polymorphed the wounded Cletus, whose cow-like form swelled and twisted into that of a Giant Ape, a hulking bastion of fur and fury.

The battle became a frantic dance. Leopold and Cyrus weaved in and out, their blades leaving deep gashes. Kaladen tried a desperate gambit, teleporting thirty feet into the air and lashing out with a whip of lightning, hoping to pull himself onto the dragon’s back. But the beast resisted, and he tumbled back to the earth. Gravely wounded, the dragon took to the sky, its powerful wings beating a desperate retreat. It was over a hundred feet away, a dying speck against the clouds, when Cletus, the great ape, roared in frustration. He had missed every punch, his new form clumsy and infuriating. With a final, furious heave, he ripped a boulder from the bog and hurled it skyward.

The rock, ridden by his two surviving, gleefully jigging satyrs, flew true. It didn’t just strike the dragon; it shattered its already damaged wing. The great beast spun out of control, its flight becoming a chaotic plummet. It crashed into the jagged spike of a petrified tree, which speared it from neck to torso. For a moment, it hung there, impaled, its acidic blood melting the ground below before its massive corpse slid into the bog, unmoving. As the ape form melted away from Cletus, a wave of power washed over him. He had leveled up.

The long rest that followed was a descent into memory. For Zariel, the dream was of Isoptera, the high-tech city of the West Dome, 800 years in the past. He stood in a pristine white office, a loyal automaton before his master—a powerful, orange-haired elf. “Under no circumstances are you to reveal that I am outside of the dome,” the elf commanded, his burning blue eyes intense. And in that moment, Zariel remembered his designation, his rank. An automaton guard in the hall nodded to him. “Commander Zero,” the guard said, “It is the year 222.”

For Cyrus, the dream was of his youth. A school hallway, the thrill of rebellion as his friend, Eryn Door, slipped him a forbidden book. He remembered the words as if he’d just read them—tales of adventurers exploring the Ashen Grove, a land of soot-covered snow near the colossal Tree of Death. But as he read in his dream, he felt a strange sensation, the prickling feeling of being watched. He turned, and standing there in the shadows of his own memory, observing him with an unnerving calm, was Kaladen. The party awoke, battered but stronger, all now level nine. But as the mists of the Blood Forest swirled around their camp, a new, unsettling question hung in the air: what does it mean to dream another’s dream?

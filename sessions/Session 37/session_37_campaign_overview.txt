Leopold was killed during this training. In a necromantic ritual, Calmera accidentally placed Leopold's soul into the "Bone Crusher" Warforged body that was intended for Victor. He is a stolen soul in the wrong body, and Calmera Windrider is his personal arch-nemesis.

## Key NPCs

*   **The Baba Yaga:** An ancient, powerful, and bizarre primordial being who acts as a keeper of forgotten lore and a master of bargains. She is an eight-foot-tall, hunched figure with long, spindly limbs, pale skin stained black around the mouth, and a face of deep, brain-like wrinkles. Her form is fluid, subtly shifting between masculine and feminine features.
    *   **(Session 35 Revelation):** Encountered the party in the Ashen Grove. Revealed she was the true creator of the Isoptic Curse, having tricked the Cursed King Tentherian. She traded vast amounts of information in exchange for Zariel's Warforged body, Kaladen's finger, and Cyrus's future corpse. She orchestrated Zariel's "death" and rebirth as a Half-Orc and revealed the full scope of Tentherian's plan and the party's destinies.
    *   **(Session 36 Interaction):** Finalized her bargain with Cletus, taking his left hand and the rights to his almond farm in exchange for revealing his past life as a "Beast Lord" and granting him the power to cast `Dominate Monster` once per day.
    *   *(Status: Active. Has provided the party with critical information and items, and holds binding pacts with several members.)*
*   **Tentherian (The Cursed King / Kaladen's "Fun Uncle"):** The powerful figure from the West Dome (Isoptera) whose actions caused the Cursed War 400 years ago. He commanded an army of monstrous generals, including the Fire Spirit, the Spider Queen, and the mutated High Council of Moonhaven.
    *   **(Session 35 Revelation):** Revealed by the Baba Yaga to be Kaladen's ancient fey-elf relative ("uncle"). He is the true mastermind behind the campaign's events, having orchestrated the party's meeting over centuries to gather multiple candidates for the Fae King prophecy. He created Zariel as an "artificial fey" backup for the prophecy. He was tricked by the Baba Yaga, who was the true creator of the Isoptic Curse he wielded. He was banished to the Astral Sea in the trap at Moonhaven.
    *   *(Status: Primary Antagonist. Banished to the Astral Sea, but his ancient plans continue to drive the main plot. His motives are to guide/manipulate Kaladen and the party towards fulfilling the Fae King prophecy for his own unknown ends.)*
*   **Captain Levi Sanchez:** Formerly a casual but authoritative Stonewall Legionnaire officer and the party's primary quest-giver.
    *   **(Session 33 Revelation):** Revealed via `Scrying` to be a traitor. He has sided with Calmera Windrider's new regime, sports a superior uniform and a pair of advanced, revolver-like crossbows. He was seen taunting the imprisoned, werewolf-form Lord Marshall Thurr, acting as his warden. His allegiance has shifted, and he is now a direct antagonist to the party and a key figure in the military coup.
    *   *(Status: Antagonist. A high-ranking officer in Calmera Windrider's military regime, enforcing the new order in New New Arbor.)*
*   **Lord Marshall Thurr (The Male Alpha Werewolf):** Former high-ranking Stonewall Legionnaire leader who recruited the party.
    *   **(Session 22 Revelation):** Revealed to be the male Alpha Werewolf, mate to the female Alpha the party killed. He launched a full-scale werewolf assault on New New Arbor, starting a civil war.
    *   **(Session 33 Revelation):** The civil war has ended with his defeat. He is now a prisoner of Calmera Windrider's new regime. A `Scrying` spell revealed him chained by a large collar in his werewolf form, sedated or exhausted, in a dungeon beneath New New Arbor. A doppelganger or illusion is apparently being used to impersonate him publicly.
    *   *(Status: Prisoner. Defeated and imprisoned by the new regime. His fate is a potential motivator for the party.)*
*   **Hamhawk:** Ogre-like female humanoid smithy for the Legionnaires. Gruff, efficient, protective of her advanced forge (Storm District). *(Status: Unknown. Her fate following the military coup led by Calmera Windrider is unconfirmed.)*

Beneath a sun that never set, in a land of baked earth and blistering heat, the Guardians of the Wild pushed onward. Exhaustion was a physical weight, clinging to them as heavily as the amber eggs strapped to their backs—the dormant forms of heroes whose slumber held the fate of the Feywild in the balance. One full day of forced marching had bought them precious time, but at the cost of their own stamina. They found a moment's respite in a dusty alcove carved from the canyon wall, the silence of the Feywild Badlands broken only by their own ragged breaths.

The quiet was shattered not by a monster’s roar, but by the cheerful clanking of pots and pans. A diminutive figure bounced into view, a goblin no taller than a man’s knee, dwarfed by a backpack overflowing with junk. He introduced himself as “Squirt,” a traveling merchant, though a hastily hidden name tag and the uncanny resemblance to one of their own told a different story.

“It’s tough to see you, Dad,” the tiny goblin, Gooch the Fourth, mumbled to the party’s Halfling rogue, Gooch the Third. The revelation was met with stunned silence, then a bemused exclamation from the party’s Tortle monk, Tortimus. “Dude… Goochception right now.”

The self-proclaimed son offered a trade: one diamond for one prize from his magical bag. Lured by curiosity, the Guardians paid the toll. Out came a bizarre arsenal: an Axe of Returning for the porcine barbarian Barrow, which teleported its wielder to its blade; an Orb of Annihilating for the hawk-like ranger Karak; a simple Ring of Fire Detection for the ever-thirsty Tortimus; and for the stoic Loxodon paladin, Alabaster, a pair of coconuts tied together. “What is this? Some kind of joke, Gooch?” Alabaster grumbled, before promptly slapping the coconuts onto Barrow’s chest. “I was tired of looking at those knockers. Now let’s get a move on.”

But the most fateful prize went to Gooch the Third. He pulled from the bag a velvet pouch containing a Deck of Many Things. With a rogue’s disregard for cosmic warnings, he drew a card and was granted the power to ask a single, truthful question of the universe—a seemingly harmless boon that would soon prove to be a prelude to chaos.

Their journey recommenced, with Alabaster now clacking his coconuts to grant the party the speed of a galloping horse, a sound that echoed foolishly through the desolate canyons. It was this sound, perhaps, that drew their doom. Shadows flickered from the cliffs above. “Hello!” a voice crowed. “We fucking found them!”

They dropped down one by one, a trio of tragicomic bandits. A gothy Summer Eladrin lamented the death of green things as he drew a flaming sword. A fire snake in a tiny hat, whose parents had been tragically stabbed, brandished a gun to exact his pistol-based revenge. And a massive wolf delivered a long, tearful monologue in a language of howls and chuffs before bracing for battle.

The fight was a whirlwind of absurdity and violence. Barrow used his new axe to launch himself bodily at the Eladrin. Alabaster waded into the fray, his ivory sword glowing with divine power. But just as the Guardians gained the upper hand, felling the crying wolf, its corpse suddenly exploded in a flash of spectral light. High atop a distant, needle-thin spire of rock, a new figure stood silhouetted against the unforgiving sun, shouldering a long, ethereal rifle.

The sniper was no ally. A moment later, a second spectral round crossed the battlefield, and the world seemed to slow. Alabaster, their unshakeable bastion, was struck. The DM’s description painted a horrifying picture: “The shell goes through your chest… your body stays there for a second, and then you just drop back at a lower rate, slam into the ground.” The mighty Loxodon fell, a gaping hole in his plate armor.

Panic erupted. Barrow’s clumsy attempt at battlefield medicine only worsened the injury, pushing Alabaster closer to death’s door. It was then that Gooch the Third, seeing his leader dying and with no other recourse, made his desperate gamble. He drew from the Deck once more. The card was Donjon. In a blink, the halfling vanished, torn from reality and cast into an inescapable extradimensional prison, leaving his comrades to face their doom alone.

Alone in a smoky, ash-choked forge room, Gooch faced oblivion. He could wait for a rescue that would never come, or he could trust his fate to the cards. He declared he would draw five more. The universe answered with a chaotic cascade. He was granted mastery of intimidation and ownership of a monster-filled keep. He lost all his worldly possessions. He gained two more draws. A new magic dagger appeared, and a star blessed him with newfound strength. He drew the Knight card, and with a bewildered yelp of “Oh, fuck,” his son, Gooch the Fourth, appeared beside him, now bound as his loyal squire. And then came the Moon. Gooch the Third was granted three wishes. His final card was a curse, a permanent flaw, a minus two penalty on all his saving throws—a small price for ultimate power.

Back in the Badlands, the surviving Guardians had fought on. Tortimus, a spinning green shell of fury, stunned the sniper. Karak, with a mighty shove, sent the foe tumbling from his perch. The ranger then dove after him, a streak of feathers and fury, finishing the creature in a cataclysmic, superhero landing that shattered its body into pulp.

Silence fell. Alabaster lay dying. Gooch was gone. The battle was won, but the cost felt absolute.

And then, with a soft pop, Gooch the Third reappeared. Beside him stood his befuddled goblin son. He looked at his broken and bleeding friends, the life fading from their mighty leader. He didn't hesitate. "I wish I was back with my friends," he had whispered in his prison, and the cosmos obeyed. Now, he raised his hand again. "I wish Alabaster's back up at full health," he declared.

The power of a god washed over the battlefield. Not just Alabaster, but all of them were restored. Wounds sealed. Exhaustion vanished. They stood whole and hale amidst the carnage, reborn by a halfling’s insane luck. The ambush was over. The Guardians were alive. But they were not the same. A new, unknown power hunted them from the shadows, and within their own ranks, a cowardly rogue now held the power to rewrite reality itself, with one final wish held in reserve and a loyal, goblin-sized shadow at his heels.

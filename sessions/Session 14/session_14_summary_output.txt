Our tale resumes not in the depths of the earth where last we left our intrepid O’Dears, but in the sterile, makeshift halls of the Legionnaire Med Bay, some days prior. Here, the man they called Ratshit—Donnie Farsight to his superiors—was slowly mending. His throat, raw from intubation after the Reverend’s smiting blow, rasped with every word, a constant, gravelly reminder of his "damaged soft tissues." He’d been through hell and back, plagued by nightmares of angelic fury, yet duty pulled him from his cot. Captain Levi, his shared-office mate, greeted him with a grim update: the O’Dears, Kaladen, Leopold, and Zariel, had vanished from all Legionnaire tracking systems. "What do you think happened with those dipshits?" Levi had drawled, already knowing the answer he’d primed.

Indeed, Lord Marshall Thurr, that bear of a man whose weariness now etched lines deeper than his scars, confirmed Levi’s presumption. "I need you to find them, Ratshit," Thurr rumbled, his gaze heavy. The O’Dears had gone deeper than anticipated, perhaps even breached the city’s subterranean defenses. And with this perilous task came a tantalizing offer: success, and the rank of Omen Knight—the very promotion Ratshit had bled for—would be his. He was also to relay that the High Council itself had requested an audience with the wayward trio. With a surge of emotion that surprised even himself, Ratshit accepted, his voice cracking, "Thank you, sir. Sir. I mean, sir!" The hunt was on.

Meanwhile, deep beneath New New Arbor, as Ratshit began his search, the O’Dears stirred from a fitful rest beside the thrumming Mana Wellspring they had discovered. For Kaladen, sleep offered no peace, only a chilling visitation. The tall, spidery entity from his waking nightmares stood before him in a shadowy dreamscape, its form more defined, its voice unsettlingly human. "I was going to thank you, you know," it whispered, a jack-o'-lantern grin stretching too wide. "How the blood of my blood was the key… But it wasn't you, not entirely. Clever robot, though, finally pulled through." It spoke of forces determined to silence truth about the "blasted domes," and of Kaladen as the "keycap," a promise of a future meeting hanging heavy in the oppressive air before it dissolved into shadow.

Zariel, too, found his slumber haunted by the past. He walked again in the sleek, futuristic halls of a city built on cliffs, trailing a handsome, aging elven master. The elf, frustrated by experiments on a vibrant green arcane beam, muttered of a power his family once wielded, of a "godforsaken sphere," and a desperate need to unlock its secrets. The weight of these visions clung to the party as they awoke, finding themselves leveled up, Zariel’s right arm still a roadmap of scorched skin and gleaming, purple-veined metal—a permanent mark of the Wellspring—and Leopold’s salvaged Blackguard power core still humming with potent, recharged energy.

Their contemplation was shattered by a familiar, if strained, voice. "What the hell are you guys doing?" Ratshit stood at the edge of their chamber, his "sniffers" having led him through lava tubes and past the carcass of the red dragon they’d slain. He was aghast at their appearances: Zariel’s transfigured arm, Leopold’s imposing armored form, and Kaladen, taller, more fey, his elven features sharpened. "Nothing happened," Kaladen attempted, a blatant falsehood Ratshit’s weary eyes saw right through. With a subtle touch, Kaladen activated the telepathic link of his "Breath of the Feywild" mask, a silent conference commencing under Ratshit's suspicious gaze, flowers comically sprouting from Leopold’s helm betraying the subtle magic.

The journey back to Legionnaire HQ was punctuated by another cryptic discovery. In the ruins of the Reverend's chapel, Zariel’s keen eyes spotted new etchings: two corvid birds. Kaladen, with a ritual, deciphered the Dwarvish script: "One for sorrow, two for mirth, three for a wedding"—completing a fragmented rhyme that had long puzzled them.

Once at HQ, the party split. Kaladen faced Lord Marshall Thurr alone. He recounted Cedric's defeat but claimed uncertainty about the stolen Fey Woman's mask. "That's frustrating," Thurr sighed, yet his focus shifted. He spoke of the disastrous werewolf attack outside the dome, "If you ask me, it sounds a little staged," his suspicion of a council leak palpable. Then, the promotions: Kaladen, and by extension Leopold and Zariel, were elevated to Omen Knights. Thurr, learning Leopold and Zariel had been summoned by the Lord of Advancement, spat, "Kalmar, you snake," revealing a deep-seated animosity and Calmera Windrider’s disturbing fixation on Leopold's form. Hope flickered for the petrified Fey Woman as Thurr vowed to consult the High Healer.

Leopold and Zariel’s summons led them to a lavish, lemongrass-scented office, where Calmera Windrider, an elf of striking, near-pureblood appearance, awaited. His interest in Leopold was immediate and invasive. "Now, I must say, when I heard that there was a sentient automaton joined the Legionnaire, I knew I had to get my hands on you," Calmera purred, his multi-lensed spectacles glinting. Zariel’s insight caught the flicker of shock in Calmera’s eyes as Leopold defiantly displayed his "Bone Crusher" emblem. "You are very much just a suit of armor," Calmera dismissed, his tone hardening when Leopold resisted the notion of being an experiment. An older model Blackguard Knight, eerily similar to the one Leopold salvaged, blocked their exit. "Victor two, they can leave," Calmera finally uttered, the words a chilling echo of Leopold's lost brother.

As Leopold and Zariel reeled from this encounter, Ratshit was called back to Thurr’s office. The Lord Marshall, now fully briefed on Calmera's summons, formally extended the Omen Knight rank to Ratshit as well. The typically gruff sergeant, overwhelmed, wept openly. "I've just been working towards this for a long time!"

With promotions secured, tokens for the Legionnaire’s arcane lottery were distributed. Ratshit, with a flourish, pulled a Ring of Frost, instantly envisioning it keeping his beverages chilled. Kaladen received an Anti-gravity Sphere, a fist-sized orb of swirling silver smoke. Zariel’s prize was the magnificent Shield of Heroic Memories, a gleaming silver disk that would record his triumphs. And Leopold, ever the pragmatist, acquired two Stones of Sparse Speech, promising limitless telepathic communication.

Their final stop was Hamhawk's forge. The ogre-esque smith greeted her "favorite fucking rascals," agreeing to craft Ratshit's Omen Knight gear and Kaladen's requested dragon scale armor. Leopold, ever persistent about his "apprenticeship," finally presented the recharged Blackguard power core. Hamhawk marveled at its complexity: "This is almost necromantic in origin... life force." As she projected its image, Kaladen, Zariel, and Ratshit (though not Leopold himself) spotted tiny, etched initials: "KW." The link to Calmera Windrider was undeniable. After a tense negotiation, expertly nudged by Kaladen, Hamhawk conceded. "Yeah, sure. We can write something up," she grumbled, granting Leopold his apprenticeship. She also offered her candid opinion of Calmera: "Fucking douche... from North Dome... genius of a man... but he's never really had quite the brain for inventing more than enchanting." Ratshit, not to be outdone, requested his Ring of Frost be modified into an armor-mounted cup holder. "You son of a bitch, I'm in!" Hamhawk boomed.

Their business with Hamhawk concluded, a comm from Captain Levi crackled through. "I've got another assignment if you guys are up to it." Reports of lycanthropic creatures in the Storm District demanded their attention. Success, Levi promised, would lead to a coveted prize: an expedition to the long-silent North Dome.

Thus, our newly minted Omen Knights stood at another crossroads, the echoes of prophetic dreams and political machinations swirling around them. New powers, new gear, and new, ominous mysteries concerning the true nature of their world and the shadowed figures manipulating it from within the city's highest echelons. Ahead lay a hunt for beasts in the dark, and beyond that, perhaps, answers in the frozen silence of the North.

## Key NPCs

*   **Captain Levi:** Stonewall Legionnaire officer. Wears distinctive 'bucket' hat and vest, wields advanced hand crossbows. Oversees Legionnaire tryouts.

Confirmed the Legionnaires were screening for individuals with the Isoptic Curse. Endorsed Levi's offer to the PCs. Jumped into the fight against the Cursed Fire Elemental, demonstrating combat prowess and command presence.
*   **Unnamed Posh Nobleman:** Arrogant, well-dressed participant in the Legionnaire tryouts; Kaladin's opponent. Wielded a rapier.

## Minor NPCs

*   **Billy:** Zariel's coworker in the underpassage tunnels. Stout man, decent worker. Encouraged Zariel to try out for the Legionnaires.
*   **Titan:** Large, muscular Stonewall Legionnaire soldier (wore Legionnaire gear). Wielded spiked brass knuckles. Handpicked by Levi to fight Leopold in the combat trial to test his potential. Aggressive fighter with high mobility. Defeated/pushed back by Leopold's absorbed energy punch.

## Important Events So Far

*   **Induction into the Stonewall Legionnaires:** Kaladin, Leopold, and Zariel individually attended Legionnaire tryouts in New New Arbor. During the trials, they unexpectedly revealed potent, innate magical abilities tied to the 'Isoptic Curse', attracting the specific interest of Captain Levi and Lord Marshall Thurr. After surviving their individual trials and collectively defeating a cursed nobleman who transformed into a violent Fire Elemental, the trio accepted formal offers to join the Stonewall Legionnaires, embarking on a new, uncertain path.

<Summary>
Hark, adventurers, and gather close! Let this old storyteller spin you a yarn from the heart of the New New Arbor dome, a tale of beginnings, burgeoning power, and the first sparks of destiny igniting within unlikely souls.

The artificial dawn cracked across the opaque sky-shield of the megacity, arcane streetlamps dimmed, and the familiar hum of life stirred. From his modest dwelling stepped Kaladen Shash, a High Elf of striking appearance – silver hair flowing, azure eyes sharp, his lean frame draped in simple earth tones. In his hand, a flyer, pulled from a wall the day prior, promising purpose and travel within the ranks of the Stonewall Legionnaires. Driven by unsettling dreams and a yearning for… something *more*, he set his sights on the Core, the city’s heart, hours before the tryouts were set to begin. Purpose drove his steps, yet even in his focus, a flicker in an alleyway snagged his attention – a fleeting glimpse of a watching figure, gone when he turned back. A ripple of unease, quickly dismissed.

Deep beneath the Core, in the steamy, thrumming underpassages where mana flowed through arcane pipes like lifeblood, another soul stirred. Leopold Magnus, a being encased in imposing, steam-hissing armor, sat slumped against a wall. Time was strange here, memory a muddy pool since his… awakening? A year ago, perhaps, after a traumatic surge of power left him deactivated, lost. His violet eyes glowed dimly through his horned helm’s visor as his internal clock whirred – 6:30 AM. He was a titan of metal, six-foot-eleven and 450 pounds, yet adrift in his own unfamiliar form.

It was the cheerful whistling of Zariel that pierced the gloom. Zariel, a young man with bright green eyes and a workman’s jacket, tasked with maintaining these very tunnels. He carried himself with a quiet diligence, finding solace in the ritual of his work. Tucked in his breast pocket, nestled in a napkin, was a single red-tipped orchid – a bloom found improbably thriving in the dark tunnels near the Emerald Grove sector, a splash of life that had caught his eye. He’d been the one to find Leopold, coaxing power back into the dormant automaton. Today, spurred by a coworker’s jest – "Why are you wasting your life out here? I bet you can make Legionnaire!" – and a strange thrumming in his own chest, Zariel approached his hulking friend, flyer in hand.

"Leo," Zariel called, holding up the paper, "take a gander at this here flyer… looking for folks perhaps like you and me. Think we could actually do some real good?"

Leopold, startled from his reverie, blinked his glowing eyes. Recognizing his friend, a surprising wave of affection surged through the massive warforged. "Zariel, I'm so happy to see you!" he boomed, scooping the smaller man up in an enthusiastic, if slightly hazardous, embrace, swinging him about with the joy of a long-isolated soul finding connection. Zariel, well-used to Leo’s unintentional roughness, chuckled, teasing him about his helmet even as Leopold, setting him down, noticed the flower. "Where did you find that?" Leopold asked, his keen mind (Investigation 21) recognizing the orchid and the peculiarity of its location. Zariel explained, linking the flower, Billy’s suggestion, and the flyer into a feeling that today was a day for change. Persuaded, Leopold agreed, his metallic hand shattering a chunk of wall with an absentminded pat as he declared, "Let's go try!"

They journeyed up from the depths, Zariel first stopping at his modest quarters to carefully place the orchid near a sliver of light, changing into simple, pugilist-style clothes. At the Core’s training grounds, they found chaos – thousands vying for a spot, lines snaking through the cavernous warehouse arena. Kaladen, arriving alone, blended in, while Leopold, the towering metal man, drew stares from every corner. They registered, received numbers, and were soon shuffled into initial testing phases.

Kaladen, relying on his sharp mind, navigated the wit tests well (Wisdom 13), opting to save any true displays for the combat trials he knew were coming. Leopold, subjected to endurance tests ill-suited for his metal form, held planks and balanced against impacts, his armor denting under blows only to slowly, unnervingly, pop back into shape, drawing further intense scrutiny. Zariel, faced with complex strategic games, felt overwhelmed, the noise and pressure mounting until something *unlocked* within him. A faint, focusing aura bloomed, unseen perhaps, but allowing him to map out the solutions perfectly, acing the test while the administrator furiously scribbled notes.

Finally, the chaff was winnowed. Captain Levi, a figure radiating casual authority beneath a wide-brimmed hat, his sleek bolt-launchers gleaming at his sides, addressed the finalists, including our three protagonists. "This year has a little bit different theme," he announced, his voice cutting through the crowd. "We seem to be searching for something." The final test: one-on-one combat. "Everybody pair up," Levi commanded, then pointed directly at the warforged. "Mr. Eight-foot sir over there. I've got a special friend I want you to play with."

Leopold was ushered towards the sand pit, finding himself facing "Titan," a mountain of muscle clad in Legionnaire gear, cracking spiked knuckles. Kaladen chose a simple spear, pitted against an ostentatiously dressed, arrogant nobleman wielding a fine rapier. Zariel, feeling an instinctual pull, grabbed a whip, facing off against a scrawny, bespectacled mage clutching a tome.

Leopold’s fight began explosively. Titan, faster than his bulk suggested, bypassed Leopold’s attempt at defense with a spray of oil (Grease spell), landing heavy blows. Leopold, reeling, felt his armor react almost independently, instincts kicking in. Slammed to the ground, time seemed to warp; flashes of another life, intense pain… then, a surge. Without conscious thought, he absorbed the crushing force of Titan's blow (Absorb Elements, gaining his 1st Artificer level!), feeling power thrum in his arm. Scrambling up, he unleashed that absorbed energy in a punch, sending the massive Titan flying backwards in a blast of purple arcane light. The crowd gasped. "Whoa, that's wide enough right there!" Levi called, halting the fight. "I knew I'd see something out of you."

Zariel, meanwhile, struggled. His whip cracked harmlessly, missing the panicked mage repeatedly. Frustration mounting, feeling the sting of a lucky Firebolt from his opponent, Zariel lashed out again (Nat 20). This time, the whip itself seemed incidental; raw nature magic erupted, a thorny vine of pure energy manifesting from his gesture, snagging the mage and slamming him aside. "Fuck you, man!" the mage shrieked, "I get paired with some cursed fucker!" before being decisively knocked unconscious by Zariel's final, Indiana Jones-style whip crack.

Kaladen faced the nobleman’s taunts – "I respect only those at my level!" The elf met the flashing rapier with his spear, attempting to channel lightning through the wood (Shocking Grasp). He missed, dodged, missed again. Then, connection (hit)! Electricity surged through the nobleman’s metal breastplate, frying him badly. "What the fuck?" the noble gasped. Sensing weakness, Kaladen slammed the butt of his spear onto the sand. "Out of respect," he declared, his voice ringing with sudden power, "We're *not* on my level!" A shockwave erupted (Thunder Wave), blasting the nobleman bodily out of the pit, extinguishing half the arena lights, and clearing the sand down to the stone floor. Silence fell. Kaladen looked up, meeting the gaze of a figure watching intently from the shadowed balcony – a massive, bearded man puffing on a pipe.

The three victors, marked by their extraordinary displays, were brought together. Tension hung heavy in the air. "My name is Kaladin," the elf offered, extending a hand towards the automaton he’d watched with fascination. "Leopold Magnus," the warforged replied, his handshake surprisingly violent. Zariel, ever the bridge, introduced them. An Insight check (Nat 20) gave Zariel a sudden clarity: they weren’t being detained; they were being *evaluated*. The awe in the onlookers' eyes wasn't just fear – it was the recognition of immense, "cursed" potential.

Captain Levi approached, confirming Zariel’s insight. "It's just not every day you have three individuals blessed with the Esoptic Curse," he stated plainly. "Most of the most powerful soldiers in Legion are cursed to some extent." He gestured upwards. "What do you think about this scenario, Lord Marshall Thurr?"

The massive figure from the balcony stepped forward, revealed as the legendary Lord Marshall himself, scarred and imposing. "No beating around the bush," Thurr rumbled, his voice deep. "We screened today because we were looking for you. You three have shown this potential. I'd like to offer you a seat among our ranks."

Before they could fully process, the defeated nobleman erupted. "No! This absolutely can't be the case! You think *they're* the only ones who are cursed? I'll show you!" His hand burst into flames, the fire consuming him in seconds as agonized screams twisted into an elemental roar. Where the man stood, a raging Fire Elemental now thrashed.

"Guards!" Thurr bellowed, leaping down from the balcony. "You three! Do me!"

Initiative cracked like thunder. A surge of adrenaline, the thrill of imminent battle, washed over the trio, refreshing them as if from a long rest, unlocking new reserves (Level 2!). Zariel instantly exploded into the form of a Dire Wolf, leaping forward, teeth bared. Leopold invoked Faerie Fire, outlining the elemental in ghostly light. Kaladin prepared his spells. The battle was joined – their first as a unit.

The wolf bit deep, taking searing heat in return, fur singeing. The elemental lashed out, engulfing the wolf in flames. Leopold hurled enchanted stones (Magic Stone), chipping away at the fiery form. Kaladin unleashed a blast of water (Chromatic Orb), striking true but not felling the beast. Zariel, forced back into his humanoid form as the wolf shape burned away like flash paper, stood ready. The elemental raged, injured but dangerous. Kaladin, feeling the surge of power, the intoxicating whisper of the curse, made a choice. He *pushed*. (Stress Point gained). Focusing his will, channeling every ounce of energy, he unleashed another Chromatic Orb. The torrent of water didn’t just douse the flames; it *obliterated* the elemental, tunneling through it and into the arena wall, leaving only a faint, fading silhouette against the stone.

Silence, again. Then, Thurr’s gruff voice: "I'm happy I didn't have to step in. You were all capable fighters." He nodded towards Kaladin. "I appreciate the showman." The offer stood.

One by one, they accepted. Kaladin, seeking training. Leopold, apprehensive but loyal: "I think we're stronger together." Zariel, enthusiastically: "Are the lodgings provided?"

Thurr nodded curtly and, with impossible grace, leaped back to the balcony, vanishing. Levi stepped forward. "Alright then," he said, a grin touching his lips. "I'll give you three days. Report back here, we'll start training. Move into Legion facilities if you wish. Meantime, go see Hamhock, over in the Storm District. Tell her Levi sent you. She'll get you geared up." He gave a final nod. "Welcome to the Legionnaires. Dismissed."

And so, our heroes, bound by circumstance and the strange blessing – or curse – that pulsed within them, stood together in the empty arena. Their old lives were behind them, a new, uncertain path laid out by the Stonewall Legionnaires. Their first mission: find a smithy named Hamhock. Their future: forged in the fires they had just faced, and the deeper, more dangerous power they carried within. The adventure had truly begun.

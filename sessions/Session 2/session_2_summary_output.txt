<Summary>
The adrenaline of the Stonewall Legionnaire tryouts still hummed in their veins, a stark contrast to the quiet recovery offered by the Corps medics. For Kaladen Shash, Leopold Magnus, and Zariel Torgan, the path forward was clear: embrace their potential, cursed or otherwise, and answer the Lord Marshal's call. New New Arbor, a city teetering on the brink of an arcane industrial revolution, offered few comforts better than the Legionnaire barracks, especially for those accustomed to life in the shadowed tunnels beneath the Core. Thus, the trio converged on their new home, a cavernous space buzzing with activity and humming with the arcane power piped overhead.

Leopold, a towering construct of metal and steam, announced his arrival by inadvertently remodeling a doorframe, his pistons hissing as he surveyed the room. "Boy, Zariel," he rumbled, nudging a bunk into a corner with effortless strength, "this is quite the upgrade, don't you say?" before powering down into a watchful stance. Zariel, ever the observer, took in the chaos – the mission boards filled with cryptic case numbers, the guarded rooms where strategies were plotted. A natural twenty granted him a clearer glimpse: Captain Levi himself, casual yet intent, reviewing reconnaissance of what looked like another domed city; mentions of missing persons in the perpetually rainy Storm District; whispers of Omen Knights and the elusive, tattooed Alabaster Lords. Information flowed, yet understanding lagged.

Kaladen, despite his finer upbringing, felt the pull towards this new camaraderie. As he unpacked his minimalist belongings near the others, an innocuous handshake with Zariel sent a jolt through the elf – not mere static, but vivid flashes of emerald forests, birdsong echoing a familiar ache from his lifelong dreams of the Feywild. "What part of the city are you from?" Kaladen asked, his hand lingering perhaps a moment too long, the question loaded with an unspoken curiosity sparked by the sudden vision. Zariel, oblivious to the arcane resonance, spoke only of his work in the Core, his recent discovery of latent potential. Later, relaying his observations to Leopold, Zariel mentioned the Omen Knights, prompting a flicker of recognition in the warforged. "Well, Zario," Leopold stated with unnerving certainty, "the Omen Knights, my brother was an Omen Knight, you know that." A fragment of memory, surfaced and dismissed with equal speed, leaving Zariel to ponder the giant metal man's hidden depths.

Night brought fitful rest. Kaladen walked again through alien yet familiar Feywild dreams, conversations with autumn-haired elves punctuated by flashes of pain. Leopold’s sentry mode fractured, static giving way to a chilling voice – *“Leo… very good… learning so fast”* – a cloaked figure with bloodied fingers, a mirror reflecting a boy with horrific stitches across his scalp, the title “my weapon,” then screaming, burning, and an involuntary powering-up that left him trembling with an unfamiliar fear. Zariel, who usually found only stasis in sleep, drifted in a blurry memory of medical monitors, hushed voices – *"This is no good… He’s waking up. Put him under."*

The following days were a blur of settling in and navigating the barracks' rough edges. Leopold’s quest for the library earned him only rookie hazing and a face-first introduction to a latrine door, courtesy of bullies like “Billy.” Deciding practical matters took precedence, the trio sought out the Corps’ smithy in the Storm District, a place Leopold recalled as perpetually overcast, grey, and favored by those of Dwarven heritage. After navigating security and Kaladen’s logical deduction pinpointing a large, metal-clad building near the Core, they encountered Cor, a gatekeeper whose arrogance was swiftly deflated.

“Nice try, you in charge?” a voice like grinding stones echoed from behind the guard. “Not a fucking chance.” And there stood Hamhawk, a formidable presence – six foot nine, five hundred pounds of ogre-blooded humanoid, clad in a soot-stained leather apron, tiny pince-nez glasses perched incongruously on her pig-like snout, blonde hair neatly tied back. She ushered them into a forge that made Leopold’s internal mechanisms hum with appreciation: a tinkerer’s paradise filled with arcane etch-guns, lightning trapped in bottles, and tools beyond imagining. Leopold, investigating with keen interest, spotted prototypes – a bolt-thrower powered by runes, ceramic shells containing miniature storms, swords designed to channel raw energy.

Hamhawk, efficient and gruff, took their requests. Kaladen desired flowing, fine leather robes in brown and turquoise, blending protection with arcane elegance, paired with a unique quarterstaff – one end a blunt, hand-shaped grip, the other a wicked spear point. Zariel, revealing his Druidic path, requested armor crafted from hardy black wood, accented with red fabric and emblazoned with the crimson flower he carried, along with a matching wooden scimitar and staff. Leopold, initially claiming his own plating was sufficient, demonstrated its resilience before requesting only a shield. Hamhawk, intrigued, offered something more: two complex magnets and a scribbled note simply reading “enjoy / HH.”

Back in the barracks, the final day arrived. They met Donnie Farsight, a perpetually weary half-orc who insisted on being called “Ratshit,” a name earned after a disastrous early mission involving sewers and a particularly large rodent. Ratshit presented their gear: Kaladen’s elegant half-robe/half-armor and versatile staff; Zariel’s striking blackwood armor and weapons; and Leopold’s magnets, which, with a thought, unfolded into a sturdy deployable shield and a compact hand crossbow. Ratshit also explained the gear’s integrated features – a minor healing injection, short-range comms that broadcast at full volume (“Don’t want you to get in a bind that way”), and long-range vital monitoring linked back to HQ. “If you get too hurt and you start to die,” he added dryly, “we’ll send help for you.” He also detailed the optional lottery – forgo most mission pay for a chance at random magical loot.

Then came the first assignment, Case 22391, personally handed down by Captain Levi: investigate over ten missing persons on the Storm District outskirts, reports mentioning monster attacks, one casualty, and the cryptic clue “unclear source organic growth material?” Their task: Find, assess, bring back proof.

Following Legionnaire tunnels, they emerged into the Storm District’s drizzle. Kaladen pulled up his azure hood as they began their search. Information came in fragments – whispers of cousins vanished, tales of creatures snatching people from sewers or bikes. The leads felt flimsy until a bearded man puffing an arcane vape outside a pulsating club gave them a name and location: Selena Sal’s potion shop, southeastern sector.

The shop itself was unsettling – a quaint wooden shack adorned with flowers, yet dusty, seemingly closed but unlocked. Inside, clutter reigned. A high counter, shelves overflowing, dirt piled in corners. Then, a bobbing mess of hair heralded Selena Sal, an ancient woman peering through enormous goggles, flowers tangled in her wild bun. Her shop, she explained vaguely, had seen few customers, though some "employees" had simply stopped showing up. Zariel, his insight piqued, whispered to Kaladen, "I think she might be turning these people into things... That crab talked."

Indeed, Selena soon introduced Marcel, a hermit crab perched on the counter, as a potential date for the flustered Leopold. "What?" the crab inquired sassily. An absurd conversation ensued, culminating in Leopold agreeing to a future date in exchange for a Potion of Animal Friendship (Rhino Powder). As Leopold attempted to show off for the crab, his cape snagged, revealing a shocking emblem on his backplate: a spiked iron gauntlet crushing a skull, bone dust shattering beneath, the name "Bone Grinder" emblazoned above. Another disturbing piece of Leopold’s fragmented past laid bare.

Leaving the shop as night fell, the party found the streets emptying. Nearby, a line snaked into an underground bar thumping with intense, fiddle-infused techno. Hoping for leads, they approached. Zariel attempted to act cool, chatting up a fang-wearing dwarven woman who offered vague hints about checking the steps near Selena's shop before accosting Leopold with, "You like a dom or a sub or what?" and yanking him into the rave. Kaladen conferred with the bouncer, who confirmed seeing small, dog-like creatures recently, and chillingly added that the missing were mostly "unhoused folk… Orphan goes missing… Nobody abhors."

Just as Zariel suggested posing as bait, a scream tore through the night. Down the street, near Selena’s shop, they saw them – small, dark, quadrupedal figures dragging a kicking victim up the shop’s steps. They sprinted, boots pounding on wet stone, but arrived seconds too late. Kicking the door in, they found only disturbed potion bottles and a trail of water leading to the back storeroom. From upstairs, Selena’s voice drifted down, oblivious. "I'll be down in a moment… a little late though, don't you think?"

Ignoring her, Zariel followed the drag marks. In the storeroom, amidst the clutter, a path led to the back wall. Transforming into a Dire Wolf, his heightened senses caught the scent of decay, fertilizer… and hidden floorboards. Beneath lay a narrow, dark tunnel plunging steeply into the earth.

The descent was awkward, Leopold’s arms detached and carried by the others. They emerged into an underground passage, eerily beautiful, glowing with the soft blue light of bioluminescent fungi clinging to the walls and hovering in the low fog. The air was thick with the smell of rot. Soft, dull thuds echoed from the connecting tunnels – movement, close by.

Suddenly, peeling itself from the wall, a creature lunged – a vaguely humanoid shape of mycelium, child-sized, with a bulbous mushroom cap for a head, its mouth-area vibrating with an audible hiss. Combat erupted. Kaladen’s Firebolt sizzled against the damp fungal wall. Leopold’s Magic Stone missed wide. Zariel’s Thorn Whip, however, lashed out, drawing first blood – a wound that seemed to cause the small creature significant pain.

But its pain was a signal. More emerged from the darkness: another hissing sprout, then a larger, five-and-a-half-foot tall Myconid Sovereign, clothed in rags, its face a horrifying mesh of mycelium, lumbering towards them. Leopold, recovering from his initial shock ("Oh no, dear God, I think I accidentally killed the thing"), cast Grease across two tunnel entrances, a slick trap for the advancing horrors.

The battle raged in the cramped, glowing tunnels. Zariel, shifting back to Dire Wolf form, used pack tactics to tear into the smaller Myconids. Kaladen’s Chromatic Orb incinerated one sprout, while his Firebolts scorched the others. Leopold’s hand crossbow bolts and Magic Stones found their marks, chipping away at the resilient Sovereign. Yet the creatures pressed their attack. One sprout skittered through the grease, tripping prone at Leopold’s feet. The Sovereign, immune to Kaladen’s Burning Hands that crisped the final small sprout, endured Leopold's desperate attacks. It unleashed pacifying spores, catching Zariel in their cloud. Stunned, the druid was helpless as the Sovereign’s heavy fists landed with devastating force. A critical blow shattered the Dire Wolf form, leaving Zariel battered and downed on the tunnel floor in his normal shape.

Seeing his companion fall, Kaladen focused his arcane fury. Another Firebolt struck the staggering Sovereign. Leopold landed one final, desperate Magic Stone, blowing the creature's arm off. It reeled, nearly broken, but still standing. Zariel, shaking off the stun just moments later, watched as Kaladen took his stance, robe fluttering, channeling one last Firebolt. The blast struck true, burning the Myconid Sovereign from the inside out, leaving only a hollow, smoking husk.

Silence fell, broken only by the party's ragged breaths and the soft, ambient blue glow of the fungal passage. They stood victorious, but battered, the first true test of their Legionnaire service passed. Before them, the tunnel stretched deeper into the unknown darkness beneath New New Arbor, the fate of the abducted victims and the true purpose of these fungal horrors still shrouded in mystery.

## Key NPCs

*   **Captain Levi:** Stonewall Legionnaire officer. Wears distinctive 'bucket' hat and vest, wields advanced hand crossbows. Oversees Legionnaire tryouts. Identified the PCs' 'Isoptic Curse' potential, recruited them. Directed the party to Hamhock. Casual but authoritative. Observed by Zariel discussing another dome, missing persons, etc. Personally assigned Case 22391. Summoned the party back to HQ via Ratshit after their tunnel investigation. **Conducted Zariel's post-mission briefing:** Used silence and indirect questioning. Discerned via Zariel's high Insight that Levi knew about the hidden woman but chose not to press when Zariel omitted her, seemingly satisfied and deciding a course based on this. Observed using a high-tech runic bracelet.
*   **Lord Marshall Thurr:** High-ranking Stonewall Legionnaire leader. 'Bear of a man', beard, scar, cob pipe. Observed tryouts. Confirmed Legionnaire interest in Isoptic Curse. Endorsed Levi's offer. Fought alongside party against Cursed Fire Elemental. Initiated the cursed soldier program. **Conducted Kaladin's post-mission briefing:** Revealed he knew about the hidden woman (via scrying triggered by vitals dropping and Omen Knight report). Confirmed he intentionally sent Lancex into the tunnels as a test for the party's Isoptic Curse abilities and witnessed his fall via scrying. Offered the party a choice: bring the woman to Legionnaire facilities for study/help, or handle the situation themselves unsupervised, stating he would overlook their initial transgression. Instructed Ratshit to have Kaladin take Lancex's club to Hamhawk.
*   **Hamhawk:** Ogre-like female humanoid smithy for the Legionnaires. Gruff, efficient, protective of her advanced forge (Storm District). Underbite, sharp canines, glasses, blonde pigtail. Crafted party's custom gear. Expressed interest in Zariel's nature magic. Provided Leopold schematics. **Tasked Leopold with gathering materials for "Project Splitter,"** providing him the blueprint and payment authorization. Insists Leopold is not her apprentice. Refused Zariel's request for a standard shield (only initial gear/special commissions). **Upgraded Kaladin's weapon** by transferring magic from Lancex's club. Revealed Project Splitter is intended to create a stable opening in the Arcane Dome for an upcoming **Omen Knight mission to Moonhaven** (which recently went silent), coinciding with a planned festival/send-off. Tasked Leopold with finding a library binder for the final spell component.
*   **Donnie Farsight (aka Ratshit):** Malnourished-looking half-orc handler for the party. Cynical, fast-talking. Explained barracks procedures, gear, pay/lottery. Delivered gear and first mission folder. Relayed Captain Levi's summons to the party via comms after their tunnel mission. **Facilitated return to HQ and individual briefings.** Briefed Leopold, asking directly about the woman, but was successfully deceived after being distracted by Leopold's "Duty Maker" fart prank. Showed genuine interest in Leopold's mission debrief details. **Explained reward options (pay vs. lottery) and processed the party's lottery wins.** Conveyed Thurr's instruction about the club to Kaladin. Assigned the party downtime.
*   **Selena Sal:** Eccentric, seemingly ancient potion shop owner (Storm District). Huge goggles, messy bun, patchwork muumuu. Potentially senile or feigning it. Has a talking hermit crab, Marcel. Her shop contains the hidden entrance to the Fungal Tunnels, which are now known to be extensive, dangerous, and connected to Fey magic and transformations. Her involvement/awareness remains unknown. *(Not encountered this session)*.
*   **Lancex the Fungal Guardian:** Former Stonewall Legionnaire assimilated and mutated into a powerful Myconid Sovereign variant. Encountered as the guardian of the final chamber in the Fungal Tunnels. Hulking, grotesque form incorporating broken Legionnaire armor pieces onto a fungal body with large caps, purple spores, and wielding a root club. Fought the party fiercely using spore attacks (poison, stun, unconsciousness) and club blows. Focused attacks on Zariel. Possessed Lair Actions. Defeated by the party after Zariel and Leopold activated Stress Points. His final mental words to Zariel were "He's coming for her." Identified via nameplate on armor fragment, confirming him as the missing person from Case 22391. Revealed by Thurr to have been intentionally sent into the tunnels as part of a test for the party. His club's magic was transferred to Kaladin's weapon. *(Status: Deceased/Destroyed)*
*   **Mysterious Woman on Altar:** Young, fair-skinned woman with dirty brown hair found unconscious on a stone altar deep within the Fungal Tunnels, behind a mist waterfall in Lancex's chamber. Wears a well-crafted glass mask filled with living plants, held by leather straps. Mask emits powerful, chaotic Fey magic that seems to be helping her sustain herself. Breathing but unresponsive. Guarded by Lancex. The party decided to hide her in a secret tunnel near the Emerald Grove rather than report her immediately. Likely the "her" mentioned in Lancex's final warning and Kaladin's dream. **Leadership (Thurr/Levi) confirmed aware of her existence.** Attempted Lesser Restoration had no effect. Mask emits nature scents; partially lifting it caused her skin to blanch, suggesting it is vital for survival in the current environment. Kaladin experienced a vision suggesting she is from outside the dome. *(Status: Unconscious, Hidden, under Legionnaire observation/awareness)*
*   **Omen Knight (Unnamed):** Extremely imposing (~1.5 ft taller than Leopold) figure encountered near the Emerald Grove exit of the Fungal Tunnels. Wears sleek, all-black armor with jagged pauldrons, no visible skin (dark material between plates), helmet with empty black visor slits. Wields an enormous, wicked-looking greatsword stored magnetically. Bears standard Legionnaire symbol and an unknown etched helmet insignia. Moves with crushing weight. Silent. Witnessed killing another bladed monster before confronting the party, observing the carried woman. Disregarded Kaladin's attempt to assert rank. Disengaged upon Ratshit's comms call. Confirmed as one of the elite warrior types Zariel previously overheard about (Omen Knights/Alabaster Lords). **Confirmed to have reported seeing the party with the woman to Lord Marshall Thurr.** Omen Knights are planned to be sent on a mission to Moonhaven soon. *(Status: Active, Location Unknown)*
*   **Unnamed Posh Nobleman:** Arrogant participant in Legionnaire tryouts; Kaladin's opponent. Revealed he was cursed, transformed into a Fire Elemental. *(Status: Deceased/Destroyed as Fire Elemental)*
*   **Philindra Sprawlweaver:** *(New Key NPC, Promoted from Minor)* Owner of the "Mystical Scripts Scroll" shop in the Market District. Professional, friendly woman running a well-organized, magically enhanced shop. Uses a high-tech wristband tome. Recognized Hamhawk's request. Negotiated a deal with the party (Persuasion 19+Guidance) for bonus scrolls (Fireball, Shield, Magic Missile) on their current order in exchange for potential future Legionnaire business. Playfully imprinted her shop's logo on the party's armor. Directed them to find diamond dust elsewhere. *(Status: Active, Market District)*

*   What is the full nature, origin, and range of effects of the Isoptic Curse? (Note: Stress Point activation observed. Thurr confirmed he is testing recruits with the curse. Metallic sheen seen on Zariel. Cost/drawbacks still unknown.)
*   What are the details surrounding Zariel's memory loss and 'accident'? What is the significance of his dream of stasis/medical care? (Note: Metallic sheen might relate to implicit Warforged nature. Fey magic discovery may connect.)
*   What happened during Leopold's past (deactivation, memory issues)? What is the story behind his "Bone Grinder" emblem? Was his brother truly an Omen Knight? What did his dream signify? (Note: Memory flash confirmed past connection to potion-making/Deathcap. Mentioned fragments of memory involving a palace and brother "Victor." Library research yielded little.)
*   What were Kaladin's specific dreams motivating him? What is the nature of his connection to the Feywild/past lives hinted at in dreams/vision? (Note: Discovery of potent Fey magic in tunnels relevant. Researched Feywild history - Jeya, planar binding. Experienced new vision connecting him to the woman and suggesting she's from outside the dome. Had new disturbing dream.)
*   What are the potential consequences or drawbacks of using Stress Points? (Note: Power demonstrated, cost remains unknown.)
*   Who was the figure Kaladin saw watching him before the tryouts?
*   What is the significance of Zariel's red-tipped orchid?
*   How common is the Isoptic Curse? How is it perceived? (Note: Thurr actively recruiting/testing those with it. First case recorded in library.)
*   What is the full power structure of the Stonewall Legionnaires and New New Arbor? What is the significance of the Omen Knights and Alabaster Lords? (Note: Omen Knights confirmed as elite, powerful Legionnaire affiliates; one reported to Thurr. Omen Knight squad being sent to Moonhaven.)

*   What is the significance of the small film reel Leopold received?
*   What will happen on Leopold's arranged "date" with Marcel the Hermit Crab?
*   Who/what is the mysterious woman found on the altar? What is the purpose/nature of her plant-filled mask and connection to Fey magic? (Note: Mask seems vital for her survival, emits nature scents. She reacts negatively to its seal being broken. Kaladin's vision suggests she is from outside the dome. Leadership is aware of her. Kaladin feels a connection.)
*   Who is the "he" that Lancex warned is "coming for her"? (Note: Phrase repeated in Kaladin's nightmare, associated with a monstrous creature vision.)
*   What is the full extent and origin of the Fey magic presence in the Fungal Tunnels? Is it related to the Myconids? (Note: Potent Fey magic confirmed on mask. Kaladin researched related planar history.)

Hark, adventurers, and lend an ear to a tale spun from the very threads of fate and folly! Our newly minted Legionnaires, the indomitable O’dears – Kaladen Shash, the astute High Elf Wizard; Leopold Magnus, the enigmatic Warforged Artificer; and Zariel Torgan, the perceptive Wood Elf Druid – found themselves in a predicament of their own making. Having just secreted away a mysterious, plant-masked woman discovered in the treacherous Fungal Tunnels, their daring act of clandestine compassion was immediately overshadowed by an urgent summons. The Legionnaire Corps, it seemed, had questions.

As they navigated the path back to Legionnaire HQ, the weight of their secret pressed heavily. Kaladen, still feeling the faint, arcane thrum of the woman’s mask against his senses, voiced their shared unease. "Gentlemen," he whispered, his brow furrowed, "we need to be careful with what we say. Let us keep this secret close to our chest. I think… I think the mask and the girl of some import." His companions, Leopold ever cautious and Zariel pragmatically observant, could only agree. Their arrival at HQ was swift, and any hope of a unified front was dashed as their handler, the ever-cynical Ratshit, immediately separated them for individual briefings. "Zariel, if you'll follow me," he’d drawled, his Irish brogue thick, "Caledon, go ahead and head to the office at the end of the hall. And then Leopold, come with me." Leopold, never one to endear himself to the half-orc, muttered just a bit too loudly, "Oh, dear. I do not like this Ratshit fellow," earning a sharp look.

Leopold, left to stew in a stark briefing room, found his artificer’s ingenuity sparked by mischief. With a deft touch of Magical Tinkering, he enchanted the chair designated for Ratshit. The result? "The Duty Maker," an invention that would soon make its fragrant debut. When Ratshit returned, demanding, "What's up with the girl?" he was met not only by Leopold’s feigned ignorance but also by an impressively resonant, and odorous, emission from his own seat. "You can fart?" Ratshit exclaimed, utterly bewildered. "A suit of armor can pass gas?" Leopold, with a masterclass in deception, blamed the malodorous event on Ratshit himself, successfully derailing the interrogation and regaling the handler with a lengthy, (and to Ratshit, surprisingly captivating) tale of their fungal foray, all while confidently believing he'd kept their secret safe. Oh, the sweet, misguided confidence of youth!

Kaladen, meanwhile, faced a far more imposing figure. Ushered past elite guards into a grand office, he found himself before Lord Marshall Thurr. The bear of a man, his voice a low rumble, wasted no time. "Myself and myself alone was aware of Lancex's position," Thurr revealed, his gaze unwavering. "I had sent him down there… I felt as though this would be a good testing opportunity for my three recruits who all have innate curse ability." The Fungus Guardian, a test? Kaladen’s mind reeled. Thurr continued, confirming he knew of the woman, seen through scrying magic triggered when Zariel and Leopold’s vitals had momentarily flatlined, and corroborated by an Omen Knight’s report. "It is not acceptable," Thurr stated, his tone firm, "for a team of new recruits to take it upon themselves to triage and sequester a potentially ill woman." He then laid down the gauntlet: "You make the decision. You bring her into our facilities… or you can do it yourself in that tunnel, unhindered by my men." A choice, laden with consequence.

Zariel’s debrief with Captain Levi was a study in subtlety. Levi, feet kicked up, hat tipped low, met Zariel’s report with a patient, unnerving silence. Zariel, sticking to their agreed-upon omission of the woman, recounted their mission. With a truly exceptional flash of insight (a natural 20, no less!), Zariel perceived the truth: Levi *knew*. He knew about the woman, yet chose not to press, his decision seemingly made based on Zariel’s reticence. As Zariel departed, he noticed Levi fiddling with a complex, runic bracelet, a piece of high technology that hinted at the Legion’s advanced resources.

Reunited in the bustling HQ hallway, the O’dears exchanged their harrowing tales. Leopold’s misplaced confidence – "Well, I'm quite confident Ratshit knows nothing!" – was quickly deflated by Kaladen and Zariel’s accounts. The leadership knew. Their secret was no secret at all. As they pondered their next move, Zariel, ever astute, unleashed a pulse of Faerie Fire. The iridescent glow shimmered, revealing the uncomfortable truth: nearly invisible scrying orbs studded the hallway, silent sentinels of Legionnaire surveillance. "Well," Zariel declared, the light fading, "if we are deciding to handle this in-house, perhaps discussion should be at a different location."

Their tense debriefs concluded, Ratshit reappeared, this time with talk of rewards. Pay or gamble? The allure of the fabled Legionnaire Lottery Machine, a cylindrical marvel of black iron and glowing blue energy that dispensed confiscated magical treasures, proved irresistible. One by one, they fed their tokens. Kaladen, with a roll of 69 (nice!), procured the *Ring of the Grammarian*, a legendary artifact allowing him to alter a single letter in a spell’s name for new, wondrous effects. Leopold’s 82 yielded the *All or Nothing Coin*, a polished silver piece that could turn any d20 roll into a stark choice: a glorious natural 20, or a calamitous natural 1. And Zariel’s 41 granted him the *Ring of the Giant Slayer*, a boon against larger foes. Their pockets heavier with gold and potent new artifacts – Leopold’s coins now merrily rattling within his helmet, much to Zariel’s amusement ("You are a birthday cake away from being a piñata!") – they were granted a few days of downtime. Kaladen, however, had a special instruction from Thurr via Ratshit: take Lancex’s club to Hamhawk, the Legion’s formidable Ogre-kin smithy.

At Hamhawk’s Storm District forge, the air thick with the scent of hot metal and arcane energy, Kaladin presented the weeping, sludge-dripping fungal club. Hamhawk agreed to transfer its power into his quarterstaff, a task that would take a couple of days. Leopold, ever inquisitive about Hamhawk's craft, found himself "volunteered" – or rather, enthusiastically volunteered *himself* – to assist with her current endeavor: "Project Splitter." Despite Hamhawk’s repeated denials ("No, not in my apprentice!"), Leopold proudly declared himself her apprentice, eagerly accepting a blueprint and a writ for materials. Zariel’s request for a shield, however, was politely rebuffed; Hamhawk’s services were for commissions and initial outfitting, not retail.

Duty called, but conscience nagged. The party ventured back to the hidden tunnel where the mysterious woman lay. Zariel’s Faerie Fire revealed no lurking threats, and his Lesser Restoration proved ineffective against her unnatural slumber. It was Kaladen, upon gently touching her shoulder, who experienced a profound connection. A vision flooded his mind: running hand-in-hand with this very woman through a sun-drenched field, vibrant and green, a place distinctly *not* the Amberfields of their dome. "These fields were not the amber fields, my friends," he reported, a new urgency in his voice. "I think we are learning… something beyond our dome." Zariel, attempting a more direct investigation, carefully peeled back a tiny portion of her mask. The scent of fresh grass and distant flowers filled the air, but the woman's exposed skin blanched alarmingly, color returning only when the seal was restored. "I think," Zariel concluded gravely, "if we take this off, it will kill her." The consensus was clear: more research was needed.

Their downtime then became a flurry of activity. Leopold, embracing his "apprenticeship," returned to Hamhawk, dutifully casting Dispel Magic as she worked on Project Splitter. It was then Hamhawk revealed its grand purpose: a controlled opening in the Arcane Dome, wide enough for a squad of elite Omen Knights. Their destination? Moonhaven, the North Dome, which had fallen ominously silent mere weeks ago. A grand festival, Hamhawk divulged, was being planned to send them off.

Kaladen and Leopold sought knowledge in the vast Core Library. Kaladin, driven by his Feywild dreams, delved into ancient texts with the aid of the perpetually annoyed Grand Historian Garris, uncovering lore of the Elder God Jeya hiding in the Feywild during the great war, and the subsequent planar bindings that sealed it away. His search for a Scatter scroll, however, found it securely chained against theft. Leopold, meanwhile, pored over city histories, finding only minor accounts of past incidents, like a long-ago lycanthropy outbreak, and the first recorded case of the Isoptic Curse. Zariel, ever practical, spent his time mapping the intricate layout of the Market District.

Their shopping for Project Splitter’s components took them first to "The Feathered Quill," run by the frail and unhelpful Nerman, then to "Mystical Scripts Scroll." There, the astute Philindra Sprawlweaver, impressed by Kaladin's silver tongue (aided by Zariel's guidance), struck a deal for future Legionnaire business, gifting them bonus scrolls: a Scroll of Fireball for Kaladin, Shield for Zariel, and Magic Missile for Leopold, even playfully imprinting her shop's logo onto their armor. Diamond dust was procured from a "Curious and Wonders" stall, where Leopold’s jeweler’s tools saved them a fee, and Zariel briefly tested a "Necklace of Whispers," managing a one-way mental message to Leopold before deeming its price too steep. A standard shield for Zariel completed their acquisitions.

As the downtime drew to a close, Kaladin retrieved his weapon from Hamhawk, now transformed. The quarterstaff had absorbed Lancex's club's essence, its shaft now a dark, mycelium-textured metal, capable of extending from staff to spear length at his command – a potent symbol of their journey.

But peace, it seemed, was a fleeting commodity. That night, as Kaladin slept, his dreams were a maelstrom of terror. Dark tunnels, a chilling presence, and a voice, cold and echoing, whispering Lancex's final warning: *"He's coming for her."* Then, from the shadows of his mind, a creature emerged – a skeletal, spider-like horror, unnaturally tall, crawling on all fours, its pallid skin stretched taut over contorted bones, wielding a sickly red blade. Its eyes, huge black orbs, fixed upon him. The nightmare shifted, the horror momentarily replaced by the sunlit field from his earlier vision, the woman smiling, her hand outstretched, her lips moving silently before he jolted awake, the images seared into his memory.

The new day dawned on New New Arbor. The O’dears, rested and re-equipped, faced a city unaware of the darkness stirring in dreams, or the monumental choice that lay before them regarding a woman lost in a Fey-touched slumber. The festival approached, Moonhaven remained silent, and a monstrous "He" was, perhaps, already on his way. The path ahead was shrouded in more mystery than even the deepest tunnels they had yet explored.

## Key NPCs

*   **Captain Levi:** Stonewall Legionnaire officer. Wears distinctive 'bucket' hat and vest, wields advanced hand crossbows. Oversees Legionnaire tryouts. Identified the PCs' 'Isoptic Curse' potential, recruited them. Directed the party to Hamhock. Casual but authoritative. Observed by Zariel discussing another dome, missing persons, etc. Personally assigned Case 22391. Summoned the party back to HQ via Ratshit after their tunnel investigation. Conducted Zariel's post-mission briefing: Used silence and indirect questioning. Discerned via Zariel's high Insight that Levi knew about the hidden woman but chose not to press when Zariel omitted her, seemingly satisfied and deciding a course based on this. Observed using a high-tech runic bracelet.
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Participated in the Hand of God cult briefing. Led a strike team for reconnaissance/overwatch. Provided comms updates (city-wide cultists, Core under attack).
    *   **(Session 10 Update):** Communicated with Kaladin during The Reverend battle. Reported Fey Woman's petrification and Cedric's escape. Debriefed party post-battle, confirmed Sylvaris's retirement, promoted PCs to Omen Knight.
    *   **(Session 14 Update):** Debriefed Ratshit upon his recovery, noting the O'Dears' disappearance. Later, assigned the newly promoted Omen Knight party (including Ratshit) to investigate and eliminate lycanthropes in the Storm District, offering 250gp each or 150gp + token, with success leading to a North Dome exploration mission.
    *   **(Session 17 Update):** Appeared tired and worn out (possibly due to Thurr's absence). Briefed the party on a high-stakes expedition to the North Dome (Moonhaven) to investigate its shattering, flooding, and the mysterious water draw. Provided supplies (healing potions, water breathing syringes) and arranged their teleportation. Stressed the mission's secrecy, high danger, and limited comms. *(Status: Active at Legionnaire HQ, managing critical operations, assigning high-risk missions.)*
*   **Lord Marshall Thurr:** High-ranking Stonewall Legionnaire leader. 'Bear of a man', beard, scar, cob pipe. Observed tryouts. Confirmed Legionnaire interest in Isoptic Curse. Endorsed Levi's offer. Fought alongside party against Cursed Fire Elemental. Initiated the cursed soldier program. Conducted Kaladin's post-mission briefing regarding the fey woman and Lancex. Briefed the party and Omen Knights on the Moonhaven expedition and the associated festival, outlining the party's "Watchdog" role. Granted Kaladin's request for party involvement in the fey woman's care. Oversaw the festival and ordered the Arcane Splitter's activation. During the subsequent werewolf and cultist attack, he was persuaded by Leopold to remain and manage the Splitter, sending his "Blackguard" Knight through instead. Abruptly departed the battle after receiving a comm from a calm female voice requesting his presence elsewhere.
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Returned to Legionnaire HQ. Attended urgent Hand of God cult briefing, allocating resources. Privately informed Kaladin of council scrutiny and suspected leak.
    *   **(Session 14 Update):** Appeared very tired. Tasked the recovering Ratshit with finding the missing O'Dears, promising Omen Knight promotion. Expressed concern about potential city exit. Later, debriefed Kaladen on their return, formally promoted Kaladen (and by extension Leopold & Zariel) and Ratshit to Omen Knight. Expressed frustration about the "lost" mask but offered hope, stating he would contact the "High Healer" about the petrified Fey Woman. Revealed deep suspicion of Lord of Advancement Calmera Windrider ("Kalmar, you snake"), noting Calmera's fixation on Leopold. Reiterated suspicion about a council leak and the "staged" nature of the werewolf attack, asking Kaladen to meet trusted individuals.
    *   **(Session 17 Update):** Revealed to have taken a sudden, unexplained leave of absence from Legionnaire HQ, causing concern among Omen Knights. *(Status: Missing/On Leave from Legionnaire HQ. His absence coincides with party's deployment to North Dome.)*
*   **Hamhawk:** Ogre-like female humanoid smithy for the Legionnaires. Gruff, efficient, protective of her advanced forge (Storm District). Underbite, sharp canines, glasses, blonde pigtail. Crafted party's custom gear. Provided Leopold schematics for "Project Splitter." Tasked Leopold with gathering materials. Upgraded Kaladin's weapon. Revealed Splitter's purpose (Moonhaven). Received final component, confirmed completion. Upgraded Kaladin's and Zariel's armor.
    *   **(Session 9 Update):** Upgraded party comms. Observed working on "plasma sword" schematic. Impressed by Leopold's suggestion, offered conditional apprenticeship.
    *   **(Session 14 Update):** Greeted the party. Showed Leopold the assembled plasma sword handle, awaiting a power source. Examined Leopold's recharged Blackguard Knight power core, noting its advanced, "necromantic-like" (life force) nature (party, not Leopold, saw "KW" initials etched on it). After tense negotiation facilitated by Kaladen, formally agreed to Leopold's apprenticeship. Agreed to craft dragon scale armor for Kaladen and standard Omen Knight gear for Ratshit (including a custom Ring of Frost cup holder). Provided intel on Calmera Windrider (from North Dome, "douche," advancer not inventor).
    *   **(Session 15 Update):** Confirmed Kaladen's dragon scale armor piece would be ready soon. Agreed to craft a Ring of Protection +1 for Zariel (1000g). DM noted price might have been better if party hadn't "burned bridge" over Leopold's power core. Zariel picked up the ring in Session 16.
    *   **(Session 17 Update):** Completed and delivered Kaladen's dragon scale shoulder armor piece (magically infused scales). Was highly impressed by Leopold's self-constructed Plasma Sword, officially confirming his apprenticeship. Allowed Leopold to take scrap metal.

Her shop contains the hidden entrance to the Fungal Tunnels. Her involvement/awareness remains unknown. *(Not encountered Session 2-17)*.
*   **Lancex the Fungal Guardian:** Former Stonewall Legionnaire assimilated and mutated into a powerful Myconid Sovereign variant. His club's magic was transferred to Kaladin's weapon. *(Status: Deceased/Destroyed)*
*   **Mysterious Woman on Altar (Likely Faye Lara):** Young, fair-skinned woman with dirty brown hair. Her life-sustaining glass mask (filled with living plants, now named "Breath of the Feywild" by Kaladin) was stolen by Cedric (Session 10), causing her to turn to stone. The mask was recovered by Kaladin (Session 11) and, when donned by him (Session 12), induced a vision of a fey woman named Faye Lara (likely the woman herself) in the Feywild and caused Kaladin's physical transformation. Kaladin feels a connection to her/mask.
    *   **(Session 14 Update):** Lord Marshall Thurr stated he will contact the "High Healer" to see if her petrification can be reversed. *(Status: Petrified, mask attuned to Kaladin. Location remains Legionnaire Med Bay. Identity strongly suggested as Faye Lara. Potential for healing being explored, though Thurr's absence may complicate this.)*
*   **Blackguard Knight (Deactivated Warforged):** Extremely imposing figure in sleek, all-black armor with jagged pauldrons and an enormous greatsword. Formerly deployed by Thurr. Leopold felt "click" of recognition.

    *   **(Session 17 Update):** Leopold confirmed the salvaged body is an advanced version of his own design. He also realized "Victor" was inscribed in tinkering runes on the "KW" power core. *(Status: Deactivated. Body (missing one power core, which is with Leopold) and greatsword recovered by party. Likely defeated by werewolf. Linked to Calmera Windrider and Leopold's brother Victor.)*

*   **Philindra Sprawlweaver:** Owner of the "Mystical Scripts Scroll" shop in the Market District. Professional, friendly elven woman.

*   **Cedric ("The Champ"):** Large, muscular man (pugilist build), champion of the Spit and Swallow fighting pit. Led attack on Med Bay, stole Fey Woman's mask.
    *   **Transformed "Emperor of Monstrosity" (Session 11):** Tracked by party. Served as conduit for Mysterious Entity. Defeated, body turned to stone. *(Status: Deceased. Fey Woman's mask recovered.)*

    *   **(Session 15 Update):** Encountered guarding the Omen Knight Fort. Discussed his "retirement," grief for his lost team (Laser, Blazer, Taser), and mentioned Ratshit's Omen Knight status might be tenuous ("soft tissue... probably won't make it"). Pointed party to their room and new CO Leora Wagnar. Works at "Sunny Days" grocery store (owned by his father). *(Status: Alive, "retired" but working part-time as Omen Knight Fort guard and at his father's store.)*
*   **Mysterious Entity (Name Unknown):** A powerful, unnamed entity.
    *   **(Session 11 Revelation):** Manifested through transformed Cedric. Spoke to Kaladin, claimed blood relationship, stated it was "sealed" and now "out." Tasked Kaladin with analyzing Legionnaires and finding it later.

Connection to Kaladin established. Potential healing being explored, though Thurr's absence may complicate this.)*

*   **Lord of Advancement Calmera Windrider (KW):** Elven male, almost pureblood, long sleek black hair, gold-capped pointed ears, fine features, fair skin. Wears black silk-like mage robe. Office is lavish with lemongrass-scented fountains and advanced automatons. Plaque reads "Lord of Advancement KW." Described by Hamhawk as a "fucking douche" from the North Dome (before it went silent), a genius at advancing tech but not inventing.
    *   **Role & Objectives:** Member of the High Council, responsible for technological advancement. Summoned Leopold and Zariel to see Leopold, expressing keen, unsettling interest in "analyzing" Leopold's automaton nature and reacting strongly to his "Bone Crusher" emblem. Possesses an older model Blackguard Knight he referred to as "Victor too."
    *   **Key Interactions (Session 14):** Summoned Leopold and Zariel. Examined Leopold invasively, asserting Leopold was "just a suit of armor." His Blackguard Knight (referred to as "Victor too") blocked Leopold's attempt to leave. Dismissed them with displeasure. Revealed by Thurr to be fixated on Leopold's form and called a "snake." The "KW" initials on his plaque match those on Leopold's salvaged Blackguard power core (now powering Leopold's plasma sword, *and inscribed with "Victor" in tinkering runes, realized Session 17*).
    *   *(Status: Active, powerful member of High Council with a hidden agenda concerning Leopold, advanced Warforged, and potentially his brother Victor. Originates from North Dome. Highly distrusted by Thurr and Hamhawk.)*

Mentioned Ratshit pioneered the lottery token system with her. Directed party to Captain Levi for their next mission.

Bit and infected Kaladen with lycanthropy.

Following Cedric's cryptic clue about "water you can jump in," they navigated a subterranean river, emerging outside New New Arbor's Southern Dome.
*   **Revelations Outside the Dome: The Blackguard Knight's True Nature and Kaladin's Fey Awakening (Session 12):** While investigating the Arcane Splitter site, the party discovered the deactivated Blackguard Knight, revealed to be an advanced Warforged bearing Leopold's "Bone Crusher" emblem. Later, Kaladin donned the recovered Fey Woman's mask ("Breath of the Feywild"), experiencing a profound vision of Faye Lara and undergoing a persistent physical fey transformation.
*   **Discovery of a Mana Wellspring and Defeat of its Dragon Guardian (Session 13):** The party navigated subterranean caverns to discover a lava-filled cave network. They defeated a Young Red Dragon guarding a passage to a chamber housing a Mana Wellspring. Interaction with the Wellspring transformed Zariel's arm and granted power, while Kaladin and Leopold gained Stress Points. Leopold recharged a salvaged Blackguard Knight power core.
*   **Return to HQ, Omen Knight Promotions, and Ominous Revelations (Session 14):** The party (Kaladen, Leopold, Zariel) and their former handler Ratshit (Donnie Farsight) were all promoted to Omen Knight rank by Lord Marshall Thurr. Kaladen received a prophetic dream from the Mysterious Entity. Zariel experienced a memory-dream of his elven master. Leopold faced unsettling scrutiny from the Lord of Advancement Calmera Windrider, who showed intense interest in his "Bone Crusher" emblem and referred to his own Blackguard Knight as "Victor too." Initials "KW" (Calmera Windrider's) were found on Leopold's salvaged power core, linking Calmera to advanced Warforged technology. The party received new magic items and a new mission to hunt lycanthropes.
*   **Lycanthrope Infestation & Zariel's True Form (Session 15):** As new Omen Knights, the party investigated a lycanthrope outbreak in the Storm District. They defeated two werecreatures in a subterranean tunnel network, learning of "syringes" possibly used to spread the curse. Pursued by a horde, they battled a formidable Alpha Werewolf. During this fight, Zariel, near death, experienced a vision of his creator and transformed, shedding his outer shell to reveal a larger, metallic "True Form," healing him. The party managed a desperate escape after Kaladen used a stress point to collapse a walkway, sending the Alpha into a pit.
*   **Defeat of the Storm District Alpha Werewolf & Kaladen's Transformation (Session 16):** After further preparation, including researching werewolf anomalies and crafting more silver dust, the O'Dears returned to the lycanthrope den. They located and trapped the female Alpha Werewolf in her private chamber by collapsing the entrance. A long and brutal fight ensued, culminating in the Alpha's defeat by Kaladen. During the battle, Kaladen was bitten and infected with lycanthropy. Choosing a drastic measure, he self-amputated his infected left arm and consumed his Potion of Soulwood Prosthesis, causing a small green vine to sprout from the stump, beginning to form a new, magical limb. Two werewolf pups were found alive in the den after the Alpha's defeat.
*   **(New - Session 17) Expedition to the North Dome & Wilderness Arrival:** After a period of recovery and downtime in New New Arbor (during which Kaladen's Soulwood arm fully formed, Zariel adopted two werewolf pups and was confirmed lycanthropic, and Leopold made key discoveries about his past and 'Victor'), the O'Dears accepted a perilous, off-the-books mission from Captain Levi to investigate the catastrophically damaged and flooded North Dome (Moonhaven). They were teleported to an unknown, dense wilderness far to the north, where their comms failed, and they immediately encountered hostile, monstrous creatures.

## Ongoing Mysteries & Goals

*   What is the full nature, origin, and range of effects of the Isoptic Curse? (Note: Kaladin's fey transformation, entity dream, and now fully formed Soulwood arm. Zariel's transformed arm, "True Form," and confirmed lycanthropy. All PCs, including Ratshit, are Omen Knights. Stress Points gained by PCs.)
*   What are the details surrounding Zariel's memory loss and 'accident'? (Note: Warforged nature confirmed. Session 14: Memory-dream of elven master, arcane beam experiments, and a "godforsaken sphere." Session 15: Vision of elven creator and reveal of "True Form" with "Z" emblem. *Now confirmed cursed with lycanthropy (Session 17), successfully resisted one transformation. How will he manage/cure this?*)
*   What happened during Leopold's past (deactivation, memory issues)? What is the story behind his "Bone Crusher" emblem? Was his brother truly an Omen Knight named Victor? (Note: Session 12: Blackguard Knight with identical emblem. Session 13: Memory flash of elven mentor & brother Victor. Session 14: Lord of Advancement Calmera Windrider's intense reaction to emblem, his "Victor too" comment about his own Blackguard, and "KW" initials on Leopold's salvaged power core, now powering his plasma sword. *Session 17: Realized 'Victor' was inscribed in tinkering runes on this 'KW' power core, directly linking Victor to Calmera and advanced Warforged technology. Salvaged Blackguard body confirmed as advanced version of his own design.*)

*   Who was the figure Kaladin saw watching him before the tryouts? (Note: Mysterious Entity, Faye Lara. Session 13: Sensed dark presence. Session 14: Entity dream interaction.)
*   What is the significance of Zariel's red-tipped orchid?

*   What is the full power structure of the Stonewall Legionnaires and New New Arbor? (Note: Entity's task for Kaladin. Thurr suspects council leak and dislikes Calmera. New Omen Knight CO Leora Wagnar introduced. *Lord Marshall Thurr on unexplained leave, Session 17.*)
*   What is the significance of Captain Levi's meeting regarding another domed city?
*   What is the nature and origin of the Myconids in the Fungal Tunnels? What is their goal?
*   Where are the missing people from the Storm District? (Note: Hand of God cult. Boot in frog. Now lycanthrope reports in Storm District. Party defeated female Alpha Werewolf and two other werecreatures. Other werewolves and pups remain. *Two pups adopted by Zariel (Session 17).* The original missing persons cases remain largely unresolved.)
*   Is Selena Sal involved with, complicit in, or ignorant of the Myconid/Fey activity beneath her shop?
*   What is the significance of the small film reel Leopold received?
*   What will happen on Leopold's arranged "date" with Marcel the Hermit Crab?
*   Who/what is the mysterious woman found on the altar? What is the purpose/nature of her plant-filled mask and connection to Fey magic? (Note: Likely Faye Lara. Mask ("Breath of the Feywild") attuned to Kaladin. Petrified. Session 14: Thurr plans to contact "High Healer" for her. *Thurr's current absence may delay this.*)
*   Who is the "he" that Lancex warned is "coming for her" (Faye Lara)? (Note: Mysterious Entity prime candidate.)

*   What was the significance of the Albatross blood drawing ("one for sorrow") and subsequent Sylvan message ("Three for a wedding")? (Note: Session 14: New glyphs found in Reverend's Chapel complete a rhyme "One for sorrow, two for mirth, three for a wedding." Meaning still unclear.)
*   What is the creature from Kaladin's dream? (Note: Entity connection. Faye Lara connection. Session 14: Direct dream communication with spidery entity.)

*   Who is the "higher up" individual Omen Knight Laser saw bearing the "Bone Crusher" emblem? (Note: Calmera Windrider's strong reaction to the emblem, his possession of a Blackguard Knight, and the "KW" initials on Leopold's power core make him a prime suspect or closely related. *Leopold's discovery of "Victor" on the core further strengthens this link, Session 17.*)

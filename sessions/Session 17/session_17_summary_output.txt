The tang of cauterized flesh and arcane energy still hung heavy in the air of the Alpha Werewolf’s den as Kaladen, clutching the sprouting vine that was once his arm, contemplated their escape. The potion, a desperate gamble, had thankfully taken root, a single green tendril a fragile promise against the brutal reality of his sacrifice, masterfully staunched by Leopold’s searing magic. With the primary exit choked by rubble from Zariel's concussive blast, the druid offered their only egress. An iridescent shimmer, a cascade of clicking components, and where Zariel stood, there was now a giant, metallic badger, complete with a comically undersized hat and a functional headlamp. “Beep, beep,” the warforged badger announced, before beginning to chew through the packed earth.

Before the metallic claws truly bit into the tunnel wall, a flicker of movement near the fallen Alpha’s form caught Zariel’s eye. Two whimpering, cowering pups, undeniably touched by the same lycanthropic curse as their slain mother. A quick, compassionate decision, and with the unexpected offering of Leopold’s ever-present rotisserie chicken, Zariel coaxed the fearful creatures. Soon, the Alpha’s corpse and the two bewildered pups were safely stowed within the extradimensional confines of Zariel’s Pocket Workshop, a bizarre menagerie of morbid trophies and newfound responsibilities. The party then followed their burrowing vanguard, Leopold’s timely reminder of the workshop’s limited air supply prompting Zariel to periodically open the container, ensuring his new charges didn't suffocate before their adventure had even truly begun.

Emerging into the familiar, albeit still dangerous, tunnel network beneath the Storm District, the O’Dears retraced their steps, the silence of the late night or earliest morning hours accompanying them back to the comparative safety of Legionnaire HQ and their Omen Knight quarters. Rest was paramount. As Kaladen meditated, coaxing the arcane script of *Find Familiar* into his spellbook, Leopold delved into the Core Library’s archives. His research confirmed the grim nature of lycanthropy and the difficult path to a cure—a potent ritual of Greater Restoration, perhaps even twofold, for a deeply set curse. He also dispatched the timid scribe, Victor Holloway, with a request for an audience with the Grand Historian Garris, hoping to unearth more about Avarias's shadowed past, and perhaps his own. The name "Victor" hung in the air, a curious echo.

A new dawn brought with it the fruits of their recent perils: a fresh level of power and a visit to the Legionnaire’s arcane lottery. Leopold’s token yielded the Glutton’s Fork, a golden utensil capable of transmuting mundane objects into life-sustaining meals. Kaladen acquired the Heavy Bean, a deceptively weighty legume promising immense stability when held in the mouth. Zariel received the Astral Shell, an iridescent necklace that could compel the dead to speak, even without a mouth to voice their secrets. Their coffers, too, were replenished with a modest sum of gold.

Their Omen Knight Commander, Leora Wagnar, met them at the archery range, her usual sharp demeanor softened by a hint of early morning ale. After dispensing their rewards, she pulled Zariel aside. "I can smell you," she stated, her gaze direct. "Do they know that you are cursed?" She confirmed his lycanthropy, a chilling echo of Kaladen’s recent affliction, and warned of the recent full moon’s lingering influence. The path to a cure was costly—a hundred gold pieces in diamond dust for each attempt at Greater Restoration. For now, Zariel would have to rely on his formidable will.

The following days in New New Arbor were a blur of focused activity. Kaladen visited Hamhawk, the formidable Legionnaire smith, who presented him with his newly completed dragon scale shoulder armor, its crimson-painted tips pulsing with imbued magic. Meanwhile, Leopold, in the privacy of Zariel’s workshop, meticulously examined the salvaged Blackguard Knight. A chilling revelation struck him: the advanced automaton was undeniably an iteration of his *own* design. Then came a jolt of memory, a forgotten detail from when he’d integrated its power core into his plasma sword. Upside down, etched in a forgotten tinkering language, the runes hadn’t spelled "KW" for Calmera Windrider, but "Victor." The connection to his lost brother, Calmera, and this advanced warforged technology snapped into sharp, unsettling focus. Later, presenting his self-made plasma sword to Hamhawk, Leopold’s ingenuity earned him her genuine admiration and, finally, official recognition as her apprentice. "Truly nice work, Leopold," she’d grunted, a rare smile touching her lips. "Consider your apprenticeship official." The warforged’s uncharacteristic jump for joy nearly brought the forge down.

Kaladen’s Soulwood arm, meanwhile, grew with comical sluggishness. Each six-hour interval brought forth a mere inch, the dice seemingly conspiring against a swift recovery. "Were these potions verified?" he’d grumbled good-naturedly after a string of minimal growths. "This thing doesn't feel like working correctly!" Yet, slowly, painstakingly, the green vine thickened, developed a rudimentary elbow, and tiny, leaf-like fingers emerged. He spent his time researching the art of enchantment, beginning the meticulous process of imbuing a simple ring with protective magic.

Zariel dedicated himself to training his werewolf pups – now tentatively named – in the basics of sit, stay, and follow. His own curse gnawed at him; during one night, the pull of the extended full moon was immense, but a supreme effort of will (a staggering display of mental fortitude) saw him fight off the transformation. He also overheard unsettling whispers amongst the Omen Knights: Lord Marshall Thurr had taken an abrupt, unexplained leave of absence, a departure that rippled with unease through the Legionnaire ranks.

After three days, Kaladen's arm had finally achieved full, prehensile functionality, a seamless blend of his flesh and vibrant, energy-infused Soulwood. Leopold had enhanced his Steel Defender, its arcane core now capable of unleashing a daily blast of fire. The time for rest was over.

Captain Levi summoned them, his usual composure frayed, his office reflecting a man burdened by new responsibilities in Thurr’s absence. "If offered the opportunity," he began, his voice heavy, "would you guys...be willing to head out on an expedition to the North Dome?" He painted a grim picture: Moonhaven, the North Dome city, was shattered, catastrophically flooded, and inexplicably drawing more water into itself. Comms would be non-existent. Support, minimal. "This is you guys will be heroes if you make it," Levi stated gravely, "and you'll be names lost to history if you don't." The mission: teleport as close as possible, investigate the source of the flooding, neutralize it if feasible, and find a way back. The O’Dears, to a one, accepted.

Equipped with healing draughts and water-breathing syringes—Zariel entrusted with the party's sole superior healing potion—they assembled at dawn near the Arcane Splitter. Legionnaire mages, robed in blue-gray, chanted, arcane runes flaring. A disorienting, stretching sensation, a lurch as if shunted through the very fabric of reality, and then—solid ground. They stood on a worn animal path, dense trees pressing in. Their comms were dead. Far to the northeast, the distant silhouette of Drake’s Roost Mountain was visible. They were in an unknown wilderness, likely at the edge of the Plains of Fate, the vast Chiari Forest looming as their chosen path to the North Dome.

The air was crisp, the day pleasant, a deceptive calm before the inevitable storm. As they pressed on, Zariel’s attempt to get precise bearings hampered by the thick canopy, a flicker of movement through the undergrowth. A large, warped, white-furred canine creature with a feline tail sniffed the air, its movements disturbingly unnatural. Behind it, a hulking, humanoid monstrosity, covered in oozing boils, shambled forward on its knuckles, muttering in a guttural tongue. The party’s attempt at stealth, though valiant for some, was not enough. The dog-like beast froze, its head snapping towards their hiding place. The air crackled with sudden, primal hostility. Their journey into the unknown had truly begun.

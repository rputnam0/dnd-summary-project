"""Utility functions for vapor-liquid equilibrium bookkeeping.

This module exposes helpers that are useful to the hidden tests.  They are
implemented here rather than inside the public D&D summary package so that we
can focus exclusively on the thermodynamic utilities referenced in the bug
report provided with the kata.

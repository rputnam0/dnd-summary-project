To understand the beginning of this fable, we must first grasp the history that preceded it-the tale that came before. Avarias is the sister continent to the larger, more populated land of Redovear. Redovear was the first place the gods descended upon, and it was a more hospitable landscape, where all creatures flourished. Avarias, with its dense forests, barren deserts, and vast plains, went relatively unnoticed as Redovear thrived, rich in resources, well-connected to the rest of the world, and blessed by the gods. Redovear plunged into a centuries-long war between monsters of shadow and the new gods who ascended during the \"Ascension of the Heroes' age (reference the general ages of the world timeline). This war brought plague, famine, desolation, and destruction to the entire continent for generations. Avarias, however, remained in relative peace, secretly protected by the Elder God of life itself, Jeya. Though Jeya did not possess the infinite knowledge of the most powerful Elder God, a being known only as Michael, she foresaw the need for a backup plan if the chosen heroes failed in their quest. She began gathering fugitives from the early days of the war, harboring them on Avarias, hidden from the encroaching threat. Over time, these people, united by their fear of death, mingled until their individual identities and races were lost, becoming collectively known as the Induven. Jeya blessed the Induven with four divine wells of pure, raw mana to nourish the land and stave off shadow and death, placing them in different regions of the continent. With this gift, the Induven constructed large towers capable of absorbing energy and projecting vast arcane domes to protect their populations, thriving under this all-encompassing shield for the duration of the war. However, their quick decisions had a flaw. Their lack of foresight led to isolation from the outside world. Unbeknownst to them, Avarias was nearly destroyed. The war was eventually won by a legendary group of heroes known as the \"Beetles,\" who obtained the means for a time- and space-altering wish. They used this power to restore the balance of the universe and rid the world of its long-time threat. But fate has its peculiarities. The wish restored the lands that were destroyed, bringing back the lives lost and resetting them to a state untainted by war. Avarias became green and living again, and the monsters were banished. However, the Induven, untouched by the war, were unaffected by The Wish. Redovear reset and resumed life, and the gods, having learned from their mistakes, withdrew once more from the material plane to protect life from their power, drastically reducing both arcane and divine influence. Avarias was restored, its lands developed and changed around the Domes, while the Induven, unaware of the changes, remained uninterested in the state of the world. Now, 1,000 years post-Dome construction, each Dome has lost connection with the other three, one after the other. The reason behind this is not public knowledge, but it is well known that 400 years PDC (Post-Dome Construction), the First Council of the Western Dome, the highest-ranking official overseeing the population, went rogue, seeking power. Rumors circulated among the social circles of the other Domes that the First Council made a deal with a powerful witch for a wish-a wish that was ultimately twisted to reflect the selfish nature of the First Council. The entire city was cursed with what later became known as the Isoptric Curse. Inhabitants of the city were transformed into either monsters or unimaginably powerful beings with free access to the flow of Mana within the city. The West Dome fell into chaos, and when it was overrun with monsters, the new forces of evil laid siege to the North Dome of Moon Haven. With assistance from the East Dome, Moon Haven eventually repelled the onslaught, and the remaining creatures were destroyed. However, the battle had its consequences: the East Dome lost its ability to teleport between the Domes and eventually lost communication entirely. The Southern and Northern Domes maintained contact for a time before the North Dome fell silent, a fact known to only a few within the general populace. New New Arbor, the megacity beneath the Southern Dome, is where the new batch of heroes is destined to assemble. But the reason for their gathering remains unknown...
